<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_Miles> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bernard James Miles, Baron Miles, CBE (27 September 1907 â€“ 14 June 1991) was an English character actor, writer and director. He opened the Mermaid Theatre in London in 1959, the first new theatre that opened in the City of London since the 17th century. He was known for playing character roles that usually had bucolic backgrounds or links to countrymen. His strong accent was typical of rustic dialects associated with the counties of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. His pleasant rolling bass-baritone voice made him a regular presence on the stage and in films for more than fifty years. In addition to his acting, he was a voice-over artist and published author." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_Miles> .

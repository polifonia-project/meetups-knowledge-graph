<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Young_Tom_Morris> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Morris (20 April 1851 – 25 December 1875), known as Tom Morris Junior, Young Tom Morris and also Tommy Morris, was a Scottish professional golfer. He is considered one of the pioneers of professional golf, and was the first young prodigy in golf history. He won four consecutive titles in the Open Championship, and did this by the age of 21. Morris was born in St Andrews, the \"Home of Golf\", and died there on Christmas Day, 1875, aged 24. His father, Old Tom Morris, was the greenkeeper and professional of the St Andrews Links, and himself won four of the first eight Open Championships. Young Tom's first Open Championship win – in 1868 at age 17 – made him the youngest major champion in the PGA, a record which still stands." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Young_Tom_Morris> .

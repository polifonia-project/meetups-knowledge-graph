<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyle_Sandilands> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kyle Dalton Sandilands (born 10 June 1971) is an Australian radio host and television personality. He is currently the co-host, with Jackie O, of the weekday morning radio program The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Sydney's radio station KIIS 106.5. From 2005 to 2009, and again in 2023, Sandilands served as a judge on Australian Idol. In 2008, he became the host of Big Brother, alongside Jackie O. In 2010, he became a judge on Australia's Got Talent and also on Australia's version of The X Factor. Sandilands has become known for controversial on-air stunts and offensive comments. This has led to companies removing their advertisements, findings of serious breaches of the Industry Codes of Practice and Guidelines, and to his firing from Australian Idol. Sandilands and co-host Jackie O moved to new station KIIS 106.5 in 2014 with their show, The Kyle and Jackie Ho Show, to the ARN (Australian Radio Network). In 2014, Sandilands made his first appearance in a motion picture in Fat Pizza vs. Housos. The film was first shown in Australian cinemas on 27 November 2014." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyle_Sandilands> .

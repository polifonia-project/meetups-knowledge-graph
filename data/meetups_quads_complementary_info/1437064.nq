As a teen model, she gained wide exposure after starring in a Haitai biscuit commercial in 1994, and held a minor role in the television drama Dinosaur Teacher that same year. Her debut studio album, Skyblue Dream, was released in 1997. Park's early career under Taewon Entertainment saw the hit singles \"Skyblue Dream\", \"Steal Away\", \"Precious Love\" and \"Don't Know Anything\", and she was associated with a charming and fresh image. In 2000, Park signed with JYP Entertainment and released her fourth album, Coming-of-Age Ceremony. She attracted attention for her provocative transformation, and the album's lead single of the same name became a defining hit for her. She released two further albums with JYP before going on a six-year hiatus in 2003. Park received her BA from Kyunghee University in Postmodern Music, and holds an MA from Kyunghee University in Entertainment and Culture." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Park_Ji-yoon> .

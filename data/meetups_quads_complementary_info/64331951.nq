<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_%22Hacksaw%22_Harney> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard \"Hacksaw\" Harney (July 16, 1902 â€“ December 25, 1973) was an American Delta blues guitarist and pianist. He first entered a recording studio with his brother Maylon in 1928, to wax guitar work backing for separate tracks by Pearl Dickson and Walter Rhodes. However, Harney recorded rarely, until his belated solo album, Sweet Man (1972). According to Robert Palmer, Harney was \"... an exceptional technician whose busy, dense finger-picking style was far removed from the more heavily rhythmic playing of the Patton-House school and who was regarded by many musicians as the best guitarist in the Delta.\" The loss of his murdered brother, a speech impediment and naturally shy disposition, were all factors in preventing Harney from achieving fame. He spent most of his working lifetime as an itinerant piano tuner and repairer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_%22Hacksaw%22_Harney> .

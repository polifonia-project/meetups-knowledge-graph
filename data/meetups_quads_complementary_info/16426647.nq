Saloma was well known for her vocal ability in singing, which was depicted as \"lemak merdu\", (a full, rather thick but sweet voice). She was signed with EMI music records and since then has released numerous EP's such as Dendang Saloma (1957), Bunga Negara (1963) and Aslirama (1972). Some of her most popular songs throughout her career including ‘Selamat Pengantin Baru’ and ‘Bila Larut Malam’ Saloma also ventures in acting careers when she acts in several films such as Azimat (1958) and Kaki Kuda (1958). Some of her most memorable works as an actress was in Seniman Bujang Lapok (1961) as Cik Salmah, Ragam P. Ramlee (1964) and Ahmad Albab (1968) as Mastura. Saloma was awarded the title Biduana Pertama Negara (First National Songbird) in 1978 for her contribution towards the music industry in Malaysia and the title Puan Sri in 1990, as the wife of Tan Sri Datuk Amar Dr. P. Ramlee." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saloma> .

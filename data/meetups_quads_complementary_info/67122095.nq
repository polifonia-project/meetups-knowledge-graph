<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armand_%22Jump%22_Jackson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Armand \"Jump\" Jackson (March 25, 1917 â€“ January 31, 1985) was an American blues and rhythm and blues drummer, bandleader, songwriter, record label owner, and booking agent. He is best known for creating the forceful \"sock\" rhythm found on the backbeat on many blues recordings made in Chicago, Illinois, United States, during late 1940s and 1950s. He wrote a number of popular tracks including his own instrumental, \"Midnight Shuffle\". In 1958, Jackson created La Salle Records. Four years later, he was the drummer for the first European tour of the American Folk Blues Festival." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armand_%22Jump%22_Jackson> .

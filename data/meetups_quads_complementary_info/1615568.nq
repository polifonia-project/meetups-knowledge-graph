<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breece_D'J_Pancake> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Breece D'J Pancake (b. Breece Dexter Pancake, June 29, 1952 – April 8, 1979) was an American short story writer. He is said to be \"one of the greatest authors you've never heard of\" according to an article on his work in Study Breaks. Pancake was a native of West Virginia. Several of his short stories were published in The Atlantic Monthly and other periodicals during his lifetime. Pancake died of suicide on Palm Sunday, 1979, at the age of 26. His motives for suicide are still somewhat unclear but many speculate the death of his father to alcoholism and the death of his close friend from a gruesome car accident could have had an influence on his choices—his writing style could also prove he was living a haunted life." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breece_D'J_Pancake> .

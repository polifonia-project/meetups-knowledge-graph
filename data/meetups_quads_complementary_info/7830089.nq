<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_Reynolds_(footballer,_born_1869)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Reynolds (21 February 1869 â€“ 12 March 1917) was a footballer who played for, among others, West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa and Celtic. He was the first player to represent both Ireland and England internationally. Reynolds won the FA Cup with West Bromwich Albion in 1892 and was a prominent member of the successful Aston Villa team of the 1890s, winning three English League titles and two FA Cups, including a double in 1897. As an international he played five times for Ireland before it emerged that he was actually English and he subsequently played eight times for England. He is the only player to score for and against England (barring own goals) and was the only player to play for both Ireland and England until Declan Rice did so 120 years later." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_Reynolds_(footballer,_born_1869)> .

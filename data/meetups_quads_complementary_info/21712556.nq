Journalist Kenan Heise stated in the Chicago Tribune that \"During the 'Golden Age of Gospel', the 1940s and 1950s, Anderson was the most highly regarded male singer of music giving off a message of joy and redemption.\" He possessed a baritone voice coupled with a style often compared to that of Bing Crosby or Billy Eckstine. Unlike many of his Chicago gospel contemporaries, Anderson was not known for stage antics, shouting, or other movements while singing. His style contained very little physical movement, with much attention paid to phrasing, tone, and dynamic style." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Anderson_(singer)> .

He won three Grey Cups for the Stampeders in 1992, 1998, and 2001, and was the second leading scorer in CFL history, behind only Lui Passaglia, at the time of his retirement. Seven times he scored over 200 points in a season with a career high of 220 in 1995 and tied that mark in 1996. McLoughlin holds eight Western Division Scoring Crowns, is a five-time Western Division All-Star and also won the Northern Division All Star and three-time CFL All-Star. He is also a two-time recipient of the CFLPA's Tom Pate Memorial Award in 1995 and 1997 for his commitment on the football field and in the community." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_McLoughlin> .

In 1954 she portrayed the Young Woman in the world premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's The Saint of Bleecker Street. From 1988 to 1996 she taught on the voice faculty at the Manhattan School of Music in New York. Carron was a regular performer at the New York City Opera from 1958 to 1973 where her roles included Anna Maurrant in Kurt Weill's Street Scene, Birdie Hubbard in Marc Blitzstein’s Regina, Cio-Cio San in Madama Butterfly Cook in The Nightingale, Foreign Woman in The Consul, Liu in Turandot, Mimì in La bohème, Virgin in Arthur Honegger's Joan of Arc at the Stake, and the title role in Suor Angelica. Her final performance with the company was in October 1973 as Cio-Cio San. In 1958 Carron portrayed Glauce opposite Maria Callas in the title role of Luigi Cherubini's Medea at the Dallas Opera, and performed the role of Liu opposite Birgit Nilsson's Turandot and Richard Tucker's Prince Calaf at the New Orleans Opera. She also sang Liu for her debuts with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1959 and the Houston Grand Opera in 1960.

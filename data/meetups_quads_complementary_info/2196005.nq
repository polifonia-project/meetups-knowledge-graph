<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louise_of_Great_Britain> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Louise of Great Britain (originally Louisa; 18 December [O.S. 7 December] 1724 â€“ 19 December 1751) was Queen of Denmark and Norway from 1746 until her death, as the first wife of King Frederick V. She was the youngest surviving daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach. The marriage between Louise and Frederick V of Denmark was arranged solely for political reasons (King George's ministers wanted Danish support in disputes with Prussia). Although the marriage was arranged, the couple got along quite well, at least during the first years of marriage. Louisa, who encouraged performances by actors and musicians, was a popular figure at the Danish court even though she never exerted significant influence over her husband's decision-making." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louise_of_Great_Britain> .

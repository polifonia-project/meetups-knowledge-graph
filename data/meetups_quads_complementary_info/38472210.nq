During this time the Surfers toured Europe with English session musicians. Sony has produced albums, and ran the Shifty Music label at BMG (Africa) for two years in the mid-1990s. He has also worked as a film sound recordist, sound designer and sound artist. Now based in Cape Town, Sony has released more Kalahari Surfers albums, and been involved in art, music and DJ events in the city.

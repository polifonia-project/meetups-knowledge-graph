LeBlanc is most striking for his work in both avant garde jazz and traditional jazzâ€”being the only musician to work with famed afrofuturist keyboardist/bandleader Sun Ra and Preservation Hall. LeBlanc has recorded seven solo albums during his career blending the varying styles of traditional jazz, avant garde jazz, bebop, and New Orleans tradition, namely Mardi Gras Indian and Second line style. He has also served as banjo player at Preservation Hall, following in the footsteps of his predecessor Narvin Kimball, and directed the Preservation Hall Junior Jazz and Heritage Band." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carl_LeBlanc> .

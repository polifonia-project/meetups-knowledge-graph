<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kangxi_Emperor> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "The Kangxi Emperor (4 May 1654 â€“ 20 December 1722), also known by his temple name Emperor Shengzu of Qing, born Xuanye, was the third emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the second Qing emperor to rule over China proper, reigning from 1661 to 1722. The Kangxi Emperor's reign of 61 years makes him the longest-reigning emperor in Chinese history (although his grandson, the Qianlong Emperor, had the longest period of de facto power, ascending as an adult and maintaining effective power until his death) and one of the longest-reigning rulers in history. However, since he ascended the throne at the age of seven, actual power was held for six years by four regents and his grandmother, the Grand Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang. The Kangxi Emperor is considered one of China's greatest emperors. He suppressed the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, forced the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan and assorted Mongol rebels in the North and Northwest to submit to Qing rule, and blocked Tsarist Russia on the Amur River, retaining Outer Manchuria. The Kangxi Emperor's reign brought about long-term stability and relative wealth after years of war and chaos. He initiated the period known as the \"Prosperous Era of Kangxi and Qianlong\" or \"High Qing\", which lasted for several generations after his death. His court also accomplished such literary feats as the compilation of the Kangxi Dictionary and Quan Tangshi poetry anthology." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kangxi_Emperor> .

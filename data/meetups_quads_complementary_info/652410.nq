He was best known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) where he performed under the ring names Garrison Cade and Lance Cade. After being trained by Shawn Michaels, Cade made his debut in 1999 and worked in Japan before being signed to a developmental contract by WWE. He was assigned to Memphis Championship Wrestling, and later Heartland Wrestling Association, before ending up in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in 2003. In OVW, he formed a tag team with Mark Jindrak, and they were promoted to the Raw brand in June 2003. In 2004, the team split up, and Cade took time off after a knee injury, before returning to Raw with new tag partner Trevor Murdoch. The pair teamed together for almost three years before they broke up in May 2008. Cade then entered a storyline with Chris Jericho and Michaels, however, he was released in October 2008. Cade was a three-time World Tag Team Champion with Murdoch in WWE and has also held the HWA Heavyweight Championship and HWA Tag Team Championship with both Steve Bradley and Mike Sanders. He was a one-time TWA Television Champion in the Texas Wrestling Alliance." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lance_Cade> .

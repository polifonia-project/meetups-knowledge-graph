<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ove_Johansson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ove Claes Johansson (born March 31, 1948) is a former American football placekicker and the current holder of the record for the longest field goal ever kicked during an American football game, at 69 yards (63 m), for Abilene Christian University in their October 16, 1976 victory over East Texas State. Johansson is the oldest player to be drafted in the NFL Draft, being 28 years, 281 days old when he was selected in the 12th round of the 1977 NFL Draft by the Houston Oilers. Johansson was a junior at Abilene Christian University after being an all American soccer player at national power Davis and Elkins College, and performed this kick during ACU's 1976 homecoming game against East Texas State University at Shotwell Stadium, in Abilene, Texas. This record kick is longer than any other field goal kicked in organized football, one yard longer than the current high school record set by Dirk Borgognone in 1985, two yards longer than the NCAA record (Abilene Christian was playing in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics at the time), and three yards longer than the current NFL record of 66 yards set by Justin Tucker in the Baltimore Ravens vs. Detroit Lions game of September 26, 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ove_Johansson> .

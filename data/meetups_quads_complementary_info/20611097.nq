<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naseem_Begum> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Naseem Begum (Urdu: نسِیم بیگم), (24 February 1936 – 29 September 1971) was a popular, and well known Pakistani film playback singer. She was referred to as The Tradegy Queen for singing sorrowful and downhearted songs in films. She rose to prominence towards the end of the 1950s, and by 1964, she had won the prestigious Nigar Awards on four occasions. Despite originally being billed as a Second Noor Jehan, Naseem Begum quickly carved out her own successful niche in the Pakistani film industry. She was the original singer of the popular song \"Aye Rahe Haq Ke Shaheedo\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naseem_Begum> .

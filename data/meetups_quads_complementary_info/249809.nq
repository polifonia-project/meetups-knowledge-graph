<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Bentley_case> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Derek William Bentley (30 June 1933 – 28 January 1953) was a British man who was hanged for the murder of a policeman during a burglary attempt. Christopher Craig, then aged 16, a friend and accomplice of Bentley, was accused of the murder. Bentley was convicted as a party to the crime, by the English law principle of common purpose, \"joint enterprise\", as the burglary had been committed in mutual understanding and bringing deadly weapons. The outcome of the trial, and Home Secretary David Maxwell Fyfe's failure to grant clemency to Bentley, was highly controversial. The jury at the trial found Bentley guilty based on the prosecution's interpretation of the ambiguous phrase \"Let him have it\" (Bentley's alleged exhortation to Craig) after the judge, Lord Chief Justice Goddard, had described Bentley as \"mentally aiding the murder of Sidney Miles\". Goddard sentenced Bentley to be hanged, despite a recommendation for mercy by the jury: Under the Judgment of Death Act 1823, no other sentence was possible (subsequently the Homicide Act 1957, which introduced stronger \"diminished responsibility\" safeguards, was all but certainly influenced by the Bentley trial). The Bentley case became a cause célèbre, and led to a 45-year-long campaign to win Derek Bentley a posthumous pardon, which was granted in 1993, and then a further campaign for the quashing of his murder conviction, which occurred in 1998. His case is thus considered a case of miscarriage of justice alongside that of Timothy Evans, and pivotal in the successful campaign to abolish capital punishment in the United Kingdom." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Bentley_case> .

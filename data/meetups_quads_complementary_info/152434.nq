<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raekwon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Corey Woods (born January 12, 1970), better known by his stage name Raekwon The Chef, or simply Raekwon (/reɪˈkwɒn/), is an American rapper. He rose to prominence as a founding member of the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, which achieved mainstream success following the release of their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), in 1993. Raekwon would subsequently pursue a solo career, releasing his first solo album, entitled Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., in 1995. The album received critical acclaim, and is regarded by many critics as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time, as well as a staple of 1990s rap. Whereas his next two albums, Immobilarity in 1999 and then The Lex Diamond Story in 2003, drew mixed reviews, his fourth album, long delayed, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II, released in September 2009, was likened to The Godfather 2. Recognized for his \"street epics\" that are \"straightforward yet linguistically rich,\" Raewkon is ranked among leading rappers. Meanwhile, he founded the record label ICE H20 Records." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raekwon> .

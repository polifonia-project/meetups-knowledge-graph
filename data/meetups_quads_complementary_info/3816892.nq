<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sandy_Bell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alexander John Bell (15 April 1906 – 1 August 1985) was a South African cricketer who played in 16 Test matches from 1929 to 1935. Bell was a tail-end right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He made his first-class debut for Western Province in two matches in 1925–26 without making much impact, but returned to the team in the 1928–29 season. In his first match back, he took five Orange Free State wickets for 53 runs (and three more in the second innings). That and good performances in two other matches saw him selected for the 1929 South African tour of England." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sandy_Bell> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kyle Forman Anderson (born September 20, 1993) is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins. After earning All-American honors as a sophomore in 2013â€“14, he declared for the 2014 NBA draft and was selected in the first round with the 30th overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs. Nicknamed \"Slow Mo\", Anderson developed the ball-handling skills of a point guard at an early age, but his height provided him the versatility to play as a forward. As a high school player in New Jersey, Anderson led his teams to two consecutive state titles, and was named state player of the year during his senior year. One of the top recruits out of high school, Anderson was named second-team all-conference in the Pac-12 as a freshman at UCLA while playing mostly at forward. The following season, he moved to point guard, and was voted the Most Outstanding Player of the Pac-12 tournament as the Bruins won their first conference tournament title in six years. He played four seasons with San Antonio before signing with Memphis." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)> .

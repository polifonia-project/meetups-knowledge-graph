Edwin co-founded Masterpiece, formerly known as Masterjam with his brother Kennedy Edwin in 2003, and has since released five studio albums with the band. Like the other left-handed guitarist, Edwin had the instrument strung upside-down with the high E on the top." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willy_Edwin> .

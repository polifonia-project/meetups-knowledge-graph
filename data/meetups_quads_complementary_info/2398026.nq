(formerly Immenslope), is an American hip hop and R&B producer from Chicago, Illinois. Wilson is also a disc jockey (DJ), music arranger and rapper, having released an album in 1997, titled Accept Your Own and Be Yourself (The Black Album), under Relativity Records. He is perhaps best known for his early work with Chicago-based rapper Common. He has since become a heavily sought-out and high-profile producer, producing hit singles such as \"Smile\" by G-Unit, \"Outta My System\" and \"Let Me Hold You\" by Bow Wow, \"Heartless\" by Kanye West, \"D.O.A.\" by Jay-Z, \"My Last\" by Big Sean, and \"New Light\" by John Mayer. Wilson, who has served as a musical mentor for several artists such as Kanye West and J. Cole, is considered \"The Godfather of Chicago hip hop\". Wilson was once president of West's G.O.O.D. Music record company, and although he would resign from that position, he stayed contracted as an in-house producer. In June 2011, Wilson announced he formed the supergroup Cocaine 80s, alongside Common and several other artists. In August 2011, Wilson became the Executive Vice President of A&R for Def Jam Recordings. He subsequently launched his own record label imprint, ARTium Recordings. He is currently the Executive Vice President at Capitol Music Group." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/No_I.D.> .

He played college football at Bethune-Cookman, and was drafted by the Packers in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Collins led the league in interceptions returned for touchdowns and interception return yards in the 2008 season. In Super Bowl XLV, he intercepted Ben Roethlisberger for a touchdown as the Packers beat the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31â€“25. In 2011, Collins suffered a career-ending neck injury during a game against the Carolina Panthers. He was officially released by the Packers in 2012, and formally announced his retirement in 2014. Collins was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Collins> .

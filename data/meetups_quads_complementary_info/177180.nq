<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoagy_Carmichael> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hoagland Howard Carmichael (November 22, 1899 â€“ December 27, 1981) was an American musician, composer, songwriter, actor and lawyer. Carmichael was one of the most successful Tin Pan Alley songwriters of the 1930s, and was among the first singer-songwriters in the age of mass media to utilize new communication technologies such as television, electronic microphones, and sound recordings. Carmichael composed several hundred songs, including 50 that achieved hit record status. He is best known for composing the music for \"Stardust\", \"Georgia on My Mind\" (lyrics by Stuart Gorrell), \"The Nearness of You\", and \"Heart and Soul\" (in collaboration with lyricist Frank Loesser), four of the most-recorded American songs of all time. He also collaborated with lyricist Johnny Mercer on \"Lazybones\" and \"Skylark\". Carmichael's \"Ole Buttermilk Sky\" was an Academy Award nominee in 1946, from Canyon Passage, in which he co-starred as a musician riding a mule. \"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening\", with lyrics by Mercer, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1951. Carmichael also appeared as a character actor and musical performer in 14 films, hosted three musical-variety radio programs, performed on television, and wrote two autobiographies." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hoagy_Carmichael> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Heyman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alan Charles Heyman (16 March 1931 â€“ 1 March 2014) was a South Korean musicologist and composer. Born in the United States, he first came to South Korea in 1953 with the United States Army during the Korean War, and after completing a graduate degree in music education at Columbia University, moved to South Korea permanently in 1960 to devote himself to research and composition. He led traditional Korean music troupes on tours of North America and Europe, and made significant contributions to the preservation of Korean traditional music, for which he was recognised with awards from national and international organisations. He gave up his U.S. citizenship to become a South Korean citizen in 1995, and remained in the country until his death in 2014." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Heyman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phil_Cunningham_(folk_musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Philip Martin Cunningham, MBE (born 27 January 1960 in Edinburgh, Scotland) is a Scottish folk musician and composer. He is best known for playing the accordion with Silly Wizard, as well as in other bands and in duets with his brother, Johnny. When they played together, they would egg each other on to play faster and faster, and try, light-heartedly, to trip each other up. Phil has also collaborated with numerous other great Celtic musicians; one prominent example of this is his partnership with Aly Bain. The duo have (as of 2020) released nine albums, and between 1989 and 2019 they had a yearly spot at the New Year's Hogmanay Live broadcast on BBC Scotland." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phil_Cunningham_(folk_musician)> .

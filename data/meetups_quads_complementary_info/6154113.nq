Uffie's music incorporates synthpop, acid house, alternative dance, and \"somewhere between electro, rap and nu skool\". She is perhaps best known for her single \"Pop the Glock\", as well as \"TThhEe PPaARRtTYY\", her collaboration with Justice which appears on their Grammy nominated album Cross. Some of her live performances have been described as \"Warholian\". In 2010, Uffie released her debut album Sex Dreams and Denim Jeans, which was included on several year-end critics' lists and was nominated in the French Victoires de la Musique for Best Electronic Album. Following a hiatus, Uffie independently released her EP Tokyo Love Hotel in 2019. Her music is said to have \"had a lasting and widespread influence in the 2010s\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uffie> .

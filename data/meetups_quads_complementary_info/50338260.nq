<http://dbpedia.org/resource/21_Savage> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "ShÃ©yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph (born October 22, 1992), known professionally as 21 Savage, is a rapper based in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Born in London, he moved to Atlanta with his mother at age seven. He became known after releasing two mixtapes in 2015, before attaining international attention with the release of the collaborative EP Savage Mode (2016) with Metro Boomin; its singles \"X\" (featuring Future) and \"No Heart\" peaked within the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 21 Savage's profile also later increased with a guest feature on Drake's 2016 single \"Sneakin'\". He then signed a recording contract with Epic Records in January 2017. 21 Savage's debut studio album, Issa Album (2017), peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 and its lead single \"Bank Account\" reached number 12 on the Hot 100. He then released the collaborative album Without Warning (2017) with Offset and Metro Boomin, with the song \"Ric Flair Drip\" peaking at number 13 on the Hot 100, though that particular song did not feature him. 21 Savage featured on Post Malone's 2017 single \"Rockstar\", which reached number one on the Hot 100 and nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 2019 Grammy Awards. His second album, I Am > I Was (2018), became his first U.S. number one album and spawned the hit song \"A Lot\" (featuring J. Cole), which won Best Rap Song at the 2020 Grammy Awards. 21 Savage's highly anticipated third album, Savage Mode II (2020), a sequel collaboration with Metro Boomin to their 2016 EP, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and spawned the U.S. top 10 singles \"Runnin\" and \"Mr. Right Now\" (featuring Drake). In 2022, 21 Savage would be featured on Drake's song \"Jimmy Cooks\" from his album Honestly, Nevermind, where it debuted at number one on the Hot 100, making it 21 Savage's second number one on the chart and his first number-one debut. 21 Savage was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on February 3, 2019. Officials revealed his status as a British citizen who entered the U.S. in July 2005 and unlawfully overstayed a H-4 visa that expired in 2006. He was granted bond on February 12 and released the next day, pending the outcome of an expedited deportation hearing, which was initially scheduled for April 9, but was later postponed indefinitely, with 21 Savage's lawyers stating he was legally residing in the U.S. for several years prior to the 2005 H-4 visa." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/21_Savage> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teddy_Riley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edward Theodore Riley (born October 8, 1967) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer credited with the creation of the New Jack Swing genre. Riley credits Barry Michael Cooper with giving the genre its name. He fused hip hop and R&B in his production work with artists including Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown, Keith Sweat, Samantha Mumba, Doug E. Fresh, Today, Heavy D & the Boyz, Hi-Five, Men of Vizion and Profyle, as well as his spearheaded groups Guy and Blackstreet. Riley's consistency and drum ideas had some influence on modern-day R&B, leading to more samples and rapping segments as well as singing, a practice which in part was reminiscent of the Jackson family. Along with neo soul-style singers such as Marvin Gaye, Riley has had a seminal influence on gospel and R&B music, which became more open to using rap and sound effects in their recordings." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teddy_Riley> .

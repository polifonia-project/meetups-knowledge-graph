<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Elliott_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bill Elliott (born William F. Elliott; October 2, 1951) is an American pianist, bandleader, Hollywood composer and Broadway orchestrator. In 2015, he won a Tony Award for best orchestration for the Broadway musical, An American in Paris. In 2012 he was nominated for both Tony and Grammy awards for Broadway's Nice Work if You Can Get It. Elliott won Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Orchestrations in 2017 for the Broadway Musical Bandstand. Elliott began as a Los Angeles studio musician, recording with artists such as Stevie Nicks, Smokey Robinson, Donna Summer, Bette Midler, and others. In his 20s he was the pianist in Bonnie Raitt's band. His career in contemporary pop music gradually and serendipitously turned toward orchestration of films, television, and then Broadway musicals. Films that feature Elliott's music include Dick Tracy, Nixon, Contact, Independence Day and Wedding Crashers. He has written music for Disney's video sequels to Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, and for the television shows Northern Exposure, Ellen and Gilmore Girls. At age 42, he formed \"The Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra\", which has performed on movie soundtracks and on record albums for prominent artists. As of 2016, Elliott is on the faculty of Boston's Berklee College of Music. He has written over 50 arrangements for the Boston Pops Orchestra and has been guest conductor for the symphony orchestras of seven major cities." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Elliott_(musician)> .

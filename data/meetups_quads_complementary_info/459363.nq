<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Han_Bennink> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Han Bennink (born 17 April 1942) is a Dutch drummer and percussionist. On occasion his recordings have featured him playing soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, trombone, violin, banjo and piano. Though perhaps best known as one of the pivotal figures in early European free jazz and free improvisation, Bennink has worked in essentially every school of jazz, and is described by critic Chris Kelsey as \"one of the unfortunately rare musicians whose abilities and interests span jazz's entire spectrum.\" Known for often injecting slapstick and absurdist humor into his performances, Bennink has had especially fruitful long-term partnerships with pianist Misha Mengelberg and saxophonist Peter Br√∂tzmann. Han is a brother of saxophonist Peter Bennink." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Han_Bennink> .

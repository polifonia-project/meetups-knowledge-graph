She loved to sing as a young girl and even appeared on \"The Gong Show,\" as a kid. She dreamed of a successful music career and did get some music gigs, but worked in the adult entertainment industry briefly in the early to mid 1980s during porn's golden age to help finance her music career. Candye was recognized as an award-winning singer, songwriter, and performer in the blues and jazz genres. She was included in the books Rolling Stone Guide to Jazz and Blues, Elwood's Blues by Dan Aykroyd, The Blueshound Guide to Blues, AllMusic, and other blues books and periodicals." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Candye_Kane> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jus_Allah> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Bostick (born June 30, 1978), better known by his stage name Jus Allah, is an American rapper from Camden, New Jersey. He is best known for being a former member of Philadelphia-based hip hop groups Jedi Mind Tricks (JMT) and Army of the Pharaohs (AOTP). He was involved in JMT since the early days but left before the recording of their first album The Psycho-Social, only to rejoin the group a couple years later. He made his official debut on Jedi Mind Tricks' second album, Violent by Design, in 2000. Jus Allah is known for his aggressive lyrics that are commonly Afro-centric subject matter, as well as heavily using a multi-syllabic rhyming technique which is abundant in Violent by Design and his debut solo All Fates Have Changed. In later years he switched his delivery to a more aggressive, deeper and raspier style, most noticeable in later JMT albums such as A History of Violence and Violence Begets Violence. Jus Allah's involvement in Jedi Mind Tricks has sometimes been conflictual, resulting in him leaving and rejoining the band several times." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jus_Allah> .

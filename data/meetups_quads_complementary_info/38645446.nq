In 1867, Hansen joined the Tivoli Concert hall Orchestra and in 1884 he was hired as a solo trumpeter in the Royal Danish Orchestra. At the same time, he played viola and violin in various chamber ensembles. Hansen was for many years organist substitute for cathedral organist J. P. E. Hartmann in the Church of Our Lady.

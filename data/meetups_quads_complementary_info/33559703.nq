She won several prizes, including the award for \"Best Lyrics\" at SIAE and \"New Indie Pop Artist\" at M.E.I. (Meeting delle Etichette Indipendenti). Her version of Don't Stop, originally by Fleetwood Mac, was the soundtrack to Eni commercials starting from January 2011. In March 2011 she released her first major album, È, on Sugar. The album produced by Valgeir Sigurðsson (Björk, Sigur Rós) and arranged by Valgeir Sigurðsson and MaJiKer was anticipated by the first single \"Giungla\", with a video directed by Valentina Be and inspired by the true story of young model Tom Nicon’s suicide.

In 2012 she entered the Sanremo Music Festival with the song \"Nella vasca da bagno del tempo\", winning the Mia Martini critics award.

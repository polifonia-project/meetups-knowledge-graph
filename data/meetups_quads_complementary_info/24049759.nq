He is a former member of the Toadies (1990–91), Course of Empire (1994–1998), and James Hall's band Pleasure Club, which was formed in 2002. He was a member of the Saginaw, Texas band Pop Poppins, a metroplex cult follow. He played on Charlie Musselwhite's 2004 release Sanctuary, and has also toured or recorded with Blind Boys of Alabama, John Cale, Anna Egge, Tom Freund and many others. Jerome is double-jointed and ambidextrous. Jerome joined the Louisiana-based band Better Than Ezra in 2009, following the departure of the band's drummer of 13 years, Travis McNabb, who had amicably left Better Than Ezra in February 2009 in order to tour full-time with Sugarland. Better Than Ezra's 2009 album, Paper Empire, marked Jerome's recording debut with the band. He has also toured with Richard Thompson and John Cale. He recorded four albums with Cale – blackAcetate (2005), Circus Live (2007), Extra Playful (2011) and Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood (2012). Michael Jerome is co-founder of the trio Halls Of The Machine. Mike Graff (guitars) and Van Eric Martin (piano) are the fellow musicians.

In 2015 the song \"Bono X\" of Halls Of The Machine was officially released worldwide on the Compilation \"I.C. - Independent Celebration, Vol. 1\" from the German label \"Birdstone Records\".

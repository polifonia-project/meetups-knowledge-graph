<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Rimbaud> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robin Rimbaud is an electronic musician who works under the name Scanner due to his use of cell phone and police scanners in live performance. He is also a member of the band Githead with Wire's Colin Newman and Malka Spigel and Max Franken from Minimal Compact. Rimbaud is also a writer and media critic, multi-media artist and record producer. He borrowed his stage name from the device he used in his early recordings, picking up indeterminate radio and mobile phone signals in the airwaves and using them as an instrument in his compositions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Rimbaud> .

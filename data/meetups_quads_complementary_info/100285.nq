<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bonnie_Raitt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bonnie Lynn Raitt (/reÉªt/; born November 8, 1949) is an American blues singer and guitarist. In 1971, Raitt released her self-titled debut album. Following this, she released a series of critically acclaimed roots-influenced albums that incorporated elements of blues, rock, folk, and country. She was also a frequent session player and collaborator with other artists, including Warren Zevon, Little Feat, Jackson Browne, The Pointer Sisters, John Prine and Leon Russell. In 1989, after several years of limited commercial success, she had a major hit with her tenth studio album Nick of Time, which included the song of the same name. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It has since been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry. Her following two albums, Luck of the Draw (1991) and Longing in Their Hearts (1994), were multimillion sellers, generating several hit singles, including \"Something to Talk About\", \"Love Sneakin' Up On You\", and the ballad \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" (with Bruce Hornsby on piano). Raitt has received ten competitive Grammy Awards, as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She was ranked number 50 in Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\", and was placed on the magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". Australian country music artist Graeme Connors has said \"Bonnie Raitt does something with a lyric no one else can do; she bends it and twists it right into your heart.\" In 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She has also received the Icon Award from the Billboard Women in Music Awards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bonnie_Raitt> .

She arrived on the music scene with her 1995 debut album, Robyn Is Here, which produced two Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles: \"Do You Know (What It Takes)\" and \"Show Me Love\". Her second and third albums, My Truth (1999) and Don't Stop the Music (2002), were released in Sweden. Robyn returned to international success with her fourth album, Robyn (2005), which brought a Grammy Award nomination. The album spawned the singles \"Be Mine!\" and the UK number one \"With Every Heartbeat\". Robyn released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010, known as the Body Talk series. They received broad critical praise and three Grammy Award nominations, and produced three top-10 singles: \"Dancing On My Own\", \"Hang with Me\" and \"Indestructible\". Robyn followed this with two collaborative EPs: Do It Again (2014) with Röyksopp, and Love Is Free (2015) with La Bagatelle Magique. She released her eighth solo album, Honey, in 2018 to widespread acclaim." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robyn> .

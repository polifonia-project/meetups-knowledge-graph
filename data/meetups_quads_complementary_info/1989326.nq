A prolific scorer, Cook led the WCHL in goals twice and the NHL three times. He was named an all-star seven times between the two leagues. Known as \"The Original Ranger\", Cook was the first captain of the New York Rangers, scored the first goal in franchise history and led the team to two Stanley Cup championships. Turning to coaching following his playing career, Cook led the Cleveland Barons to two Calder Cup championships and the Minneapolis Millers to a United States Hockey League championship. He coached the New York Rangers during the 1951–52 NHL season until his retirement in 1953. Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1952 and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1975." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Cook> .

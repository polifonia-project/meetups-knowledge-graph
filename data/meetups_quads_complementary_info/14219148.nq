<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Kane> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dave Kane (born January 26, 1948) is an American radio talk show host, comedian, performance artist, and author. Kane was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and currently still makes his home in the Ocean State. Nicknamed \"The Pitbull of comedy\" in the 1980s during his time as a stand-up comedian, Kane is known for his passionate, sometimes confrontational style of talk radio, urging people to stand up for what they believe in and to take action in the face of injustice. One of Kane's oft-spoken phrases is the well known quote, often attributed to Irish philosopher Edmund Burke, \"All that is necessary for evil to exist is for good people to do nothing.\" In addition to his strong viewpoints about current local and national issues, his radio show, dubbed \"Kane and Company\", also features Kane's self-deprecating style of humor liberally peppered throughout. Conflict between Kane and his callers is commonplace, with some of the more vociferous people attaining the level of \"Prisoner.\" This is a title Kane reserves for the most antagonistic callers who consistently claim to hate his show, but who feel compelled to keep listening and/or calling back to argue." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Kane> .

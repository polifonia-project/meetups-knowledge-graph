In his works he incorporates elements of classical, electronic and jazz music. In April 2018, Zawadzki released a postclassical minimalistic album Norn inspired by an extinct language norn for string quartet, piano and ambient synths. In July 2017, Zawadzki released his third album Between the Dusk of a Summer Night inspired by William Ernest Henley's poetry. It is a neoclassical work performed by Budapest Symphony Orchestra and soloists, combined with electronics and nature sounds. This work integrates musicians across the different music genres." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sebastian_Zawadzki> .

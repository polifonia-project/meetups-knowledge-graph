<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freddy_Curci> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Federico \"Freddy\" Curci (born October 30, 1962) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He was lead vocalist for the rock band Sheriff and later founded and became frontman for the band Alias, a position he retains to this day. Curci provided lead vocals on the Sheriff song \"When I'm with You\", which reached the number one spot in 1989, and the Alias power ballad \"More Than Words Can Say\", which reached the number two spot in 1990 on the Billboard charts. BMI presented Curci with the Million-airs award for \"More Than Words Can Say\". According to BMI's website, only 1,500 songs have achieved Million-air status (one million air plays) among the 4.5 million songs by 300,000 BMI represented artists. One million performances is the equivalent of approximately 50,000 broadcast hours, or more than 5.7 years of continuous airplay. In January 2009, Alias announced the release of their long delayed second album, Never Say Never, which was recorded in 1992 but not released due to the rapidly evolving music scene of that time where grunge was the new rage and metal was out. A few of the songs from this \"lost\" album were re-recorded and appeared on Curci's solo album Dreamer's Road, but the rest remained unreleased." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freddy_Curci> .

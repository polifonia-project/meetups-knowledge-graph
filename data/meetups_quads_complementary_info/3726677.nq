<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Julian_(artist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul Hull Husted (June 25, 1914 â€“ September 5, 1995), better known as Paul Julian, was an American background animator, sound effects artist and voice actor for Warner Bros. Cartoons. He worked on Looney Tunes short films, primarily on director Friz Freleng's Sylvester and Tweety Bird shorts. During his time at Warner, Julian also provided the vocal effects of the Road Runner. His warm and tightly-cropped urban scenes were also featured early in his career in the Bugs Bunny film Baseball Bugs (1946), and in the crime syndicate-themed Daffy Duck film Golden Yeggs (1950). Julian also created New Deal murals in California. Julian died in Van Nuys, California at the age of 81." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Julian_(artist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Larry_Heard> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Larry Heard (born May 31, 1960) is an American DJ, record producer and musician who has recorded under various names, most notably Mr. Fingers. He is widely known as a pioneering figure in 1980s house music, and was leader of the influential group Fingers Inc., whose 1988 album Another Side was the first long-form house LP. He is regarded as a progenitor of the deep house subgenre, bridging the gap between the futurism of house and the lush sound of disco. His landmark 1986 single \"Can You Feel It\" would be a major influence on dance music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Larry_Heard> .

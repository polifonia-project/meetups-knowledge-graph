Dashut was born in West Hollywood, California, and started his career sweeping floors in a recording studio where he later met Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Keith Olsen hired Dashut as a maintenance worker at Sound City and later employed him as second engineer on a few albums including Buckingham Nicks, which in turn led to Dashut's work with Fleetwood Mac. Dashut also co-wrote several songs with Lindsey Buckingham and also co-produced two of his albums, which are Law and Order and Out of the Cradle." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Dashut> .

His other big hit was \"Tokoloshe Man\", which was featured on the TV show Life On Mars and the CD soundtrack. His second album, Kongos, made the top 30 of the UK Albums Chart; but his subsequent singles, \"Great White Lady\" (1972), \"Ride the Lightning\" (1975) and \"Higher than God's Hat\" (1975) did not chart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Kongos> .

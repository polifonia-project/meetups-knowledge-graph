<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susan_Alice_Buffett> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Susan Alice Buffett (born July 30, 1953) is an American philanthropist who is the daughter of Warren Buffett and Susan Thompson Buffett. Her charitable work has focused largely on the Sherwood Foundation, formerly known as the Susan A. Buffett Foundation, an organization in Omaha that provides grants in public education, human services and social justice in the interest of promoting the welfare of children from lower-income families. She is also on the boards of the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, The Buffett Early Childhood Institute, and Girls, Inc. According to a 2010 interview with her brother Howard Graham Buffett, Buffett's philanthropic focus has consistently remained on children, education and family issues, but she has also committed to other causes, including Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa, a non-governmental organization dedicated to various improvements in Africa." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susan_Alice_Buffett> .

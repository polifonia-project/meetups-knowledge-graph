<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chisato_Moritaka> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chisato Moritaka (森高千里, Moritaka Chisato) (born 11 April 1969) is a Japanese pop singer who also is notable as a songwriter. She is affiliated with Up-Front Create, a subsidiary of the Up-Front Group. Moritaka's singing career as the unrivaled \"Dance Queen\" began in May 1987 with the release of her debut album New Season. She differed from many other female Idol singers in Japan in that she wrote her own lyrics for majority of her albums. More than 60 of her songs were composed by Hideo Saitō. Moritaka also played drums on many of the tracks, as well as piano, guitar, recorder, clarinet, and other instruments. Her musical style was influenced by Pink Lady, Janet Jackson, Roger Taylor, and The Beatles. From 1987 to 1999, Moritaka sold over 6.4 million singles and 5.2 million albums. Moritaka's advertising jingles were hits into the mid-1990s in television commercials for goods and services such as consumer electronics, chocolate, beer, gin, and travel packages. She has also made numerous appearances on Japanese game and talent shows and is still a household name. In twelve years after her debut, she released 13 studio albums and created a strong following of devoted fans." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chisato_Moritaka> .

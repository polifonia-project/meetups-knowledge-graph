He was particularly successful in the 1960s and 1970s as member and co-founder of the Move, Electric Light Orchestra and Wizzard. As a songwriter, he contributed a number of hits to the repertoire of these bands. Altogether he had more than 20 singles in the UK Singles Chart under various guises, including three UK No. 1 hits. The BBC has described Wood as being \"responsible for some of the most memorable sounds of the Seventies\" and \"credited as playing a major role in the glam rock, psychedelic and prog rock movements\". In 2008, Wood was awarded an honorary doctorate for his contribution to rock and pop by the University of Derby. In 2015, his long and eclectic career was recognised with the \"Outer Limits\" award at the Progressive Music Awards in London. Wood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 as a member of Electric Light Orchestra." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Wood> .

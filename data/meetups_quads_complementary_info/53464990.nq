<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuliya_Samoylova_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Julia Olegovna Samoilova (Russian: Ю́лия Оле́говна Само́йлова, IPA: [ˈjʉlʲɪjə ɐˈlʲeɡəvnə sɐˈmojləvə]; born 7 April 1989), sometimes credited as Yulia Samoilova or Julia Samoylova, is a Russian singer-songwriter. In early 2017, she was selected to represent Russia in the 2017 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Flame Is Burning\", but was subsequently banned from the contest's host country, Ukraine, due to violating Ukrainian law by entering Crimea through Russia in 2015, shortly after the region was annexed by Russia. In response to the ban, Russia ultimately withdrew from the contest. The following year, Samoylova was instead chosen to represent her country in the 2018 edition of the contest in Portugal. Performing \"I Won't Break\", she placed 15th out of 18 contestants in the second semi-final, failing to qualify for the grand final. \"I Won't Break\" was the first Russian entry not to reach the final since the introduction of semi-finals in 2004." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuliya_Samoylova_(singer)> .

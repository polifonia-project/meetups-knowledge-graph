<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colin_Tench> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Colin Tench (1954â€“2017) was an English guitarist, songwriter and producer. After being with for some years in the late 70s and early 80s, he founded BunChakeze, who recorded a progressive rock album. Because that genre was not commercially interesting at the time, no record label could be found to release it. In 2010, after not playing in any bands for 25 years, encouraged by friends he met on the internet, Colin released the BunChakeze album. The album was received very well, and led him into releasing a string of albums with his own projects, of which and Colin Tench Project were most important, and as a guest musician for other acts. He also produced albums for these same other acts, building him a cult following around the world.Colin died unexpectedly of natural causes on 27 December 2017, 3 days after the release of his second album with the Colin Tench Project." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colin_Tench> .

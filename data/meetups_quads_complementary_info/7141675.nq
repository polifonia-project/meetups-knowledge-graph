Cockrell was in the band at its inception in 1973, but left in 1977 before its most successful album, Worlds Away, to form a duo (Cockrell & Santos) with his wife and former It's a Beautiful Day bandmate, Pattie Santos. He was replaced by bassist Bruce Day. Cockrell previously had a brief stint with the band It's a Beautiful Day with David LaFlamme and Pattie Santos and featured guests included Airto Moreira and his wife Flora Purim of Return To Forever and jazz fusion bassist Jaco Pastorius of Weather Report." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bud_Cockrell> .

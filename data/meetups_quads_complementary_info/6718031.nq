Eriksen was born in Lunde, Telemark. From the age of six, she sang in various gospel choirs, and by the age of 19 had become a featured soloist. With a background steeped in soul, jazz, pop, and through her choral experience she began writing her first compositions. A major influence was the world of jazz standards via the Real Book. After moving to Oslo in 1997, she enrolled at the Norwegian Institute for Stage and Studio." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torun_Eriksen> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enzo_Jannacci> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vincenzo Jannacci (3 June 1935 – 29 March 2013), more commonly known as Enzo Jannacci (Italian pronunciation: [(vintʃ)ˈɛntso janˈnattʃi]), was an Italian singer-songwriter, pianist, actor and comedian. He is regarded as one of the most important artists in the post-war Italian music scene. Jannacci is widely considered as a master of musical art and cabaret, and in the course of his career has collaborated with many famous Italian musicians, performing artists, journalists, television personalities and comedians. He has written around thirty albums and soundtracks, some of which have since come to be seen as milestones in the history of Italian popular music. A cardiologist in his day job, he is also regarded as one of the founders of Italian rock and roll music, along with Adriano Celentano, Luigi Tenco and Giorgio Gaber, with whom he collaborated for over forty years." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enzo_Jannacci> .

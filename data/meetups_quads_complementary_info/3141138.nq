Jono El Grande is an autodidactic Norwegian composer, band leader, guitarist and conductor. He is the leader of the Norway Symphony Orchestra. Jono El Grande claims that his extreme mixture of genres and timbres is a result of his musical vision: moving away from the traditional concept of 'music as a result of social processes'. Although Jono El Grande is enjoying modest growth on the European avant-garde scene, he is most well known in his own country for his eccentric and amusing performance art/dada-inspired live shows. In 2000, he formed The Jono El Grande Orchestra, renamed in 2005.

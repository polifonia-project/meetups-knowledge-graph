Adams has played his bass drum in the bleacher seats during nearly every Indians home game from late August 1973 through 2019, which has brought him positive recognition from the Indians and other organizations. The Indians pay for two season tickets for Adams and his drum, he has been involved in two ceremonial first pitches, and he is the only fan for whom the Indians have dedicated a bobblehead day." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Adams_(drummer)> .

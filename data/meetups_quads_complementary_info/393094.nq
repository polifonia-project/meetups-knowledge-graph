<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Britt_Ekland> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Britt Ekland (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈbrɪtː ˈěːkland]; born Britt-Marie Eklund; 6 October 1942) is a Swedish actress, model and singer. She appeared in numerous films in her heyday throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including roles in The Double Man (1967), The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968), Machine Gun McCain (1969), Stiletto (1969) and the British crime film Get Carter (1971), which established her as a sex symbol. She also starred in several horror films including the British horror film The Wicker Man (1973), and appeared as a Bond girl in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). Ekland continued to act throughout the remainder of the 1970s, having roles in films such as The Ultimate Thrill (1974), Royal Flash (1975), High Velocity (1976) and King Solomon's Treasure (1979), and into the 1980s starring in the likes of Fraternity Vacation (1985), Moon in Scorpio (1987) and Scandal (1989) although since the early 1990s her acting work has mainly consisted of stage shows, one-off roles, cameos or appearances on reality television. Her high-profile social life, her 1964 marriage to actor Peter Sellers and her relationship with singer Rod Stewart attracted considerable press attention, leading to her being one of the most photographed celebrities in the world during the 1970s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Britt_Ekland> .

Driver creates the majority of the album artwork associated with these bands, performs the lead vocals and several instruments, produces the albums, and has written and arranged the music for both bands. Although several members of motW continued on when the band dissolved and reformed as Kayo Dot in 2003, Driver is the only remaining member of the original line-up of maudlin of the Well who is still consistently active with Kayo Dot." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toby_Driver> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kjeld_Abell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kjeld Abell (25 August 1901 â€“ 5 March 1961) was a Danish playwright, screenwriter, and theatrical designer. Born in Ribe, Denmark, Abell's first designs were seen in ballets directed by George Balanchine at Copenhagen's Royal Danish Theatre and London's Alhambra Theatre. Roughly the dramatic work of Abell might be divided into three phases: a) criticism of middle class conventions, b) fighting Nazism and c) criticism of post-war pessimism and urge for death. Perhaps he is the first consequent modernist among Danish playwrights with his use of a flash back Chinese box system and a growing use of symbols and parallel actions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kjeld_Abell> .

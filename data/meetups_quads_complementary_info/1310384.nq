<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kaki_King> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kaki King (born Katherine Elizabeth King, August 24, 1979) is an American guitarist and composer. King is known for her percussive and jazz-tinged melodies, energetic live shows, use of multiple tunings on acoustic and lap steel guitar, and her diverse range in different genres. In February 2006, Rolling Stone released a list of \"The New Guitar Gods\", on which King was the sole woman and youngest artist (beating Derek Trucks in age by two months as the youngest on the list). Her career includes six LP and two EP albums, as well as several scores for television and film. She worked alongside Eddie Vedder and Michael Brook contributing music for the soundtrack to Sean Penn's Into the Wild, for which the trio received nominations for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kaki_King> .

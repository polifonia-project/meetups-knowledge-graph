<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Cooper> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Frederick Cooper (19 March 1921 â€“ 15 April 1984) was a Welsh prop comedian and magician. As an entertainer, his appearance was large and lumbering at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m), and he habitually wore a red fez when performing. He served in the British Army for seven years, before developing his conjuring skills and becoming a member of The Magic Circle. Although he spent time on tour performing his magical act, which specialised on magic tricks that appeared to fail, he rose to international prominence when his career moved into television, with programmes for London Weekend Television and Thames Television. By the end of the 1970s, Cooper was smoking and drinking heavily, which affected his career and his health, effectively ending offers to front new programmes and relegating him to performing as a guest star on other entertainment shows. On 15 April 1984, Cooper died at the age of 63 after suffering a heart attack live on television." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Cooper> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Zinn> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Howard Zinn (August 24, 1922 â€“ January 27, 2010) was an American historian, playwright, philosopher, socialist thinker and World War II veteran. He was chair of the history and social sciences department at Spelman College, and a political science professor at Boston University. Zinn wrote over 20 books, including his best-selling and influential A People's History of the United States in 1980. In 2007, he published a version of it for younger readers, A Young People's History of the United States. Zinn described himself as \"something of an anarchist, something of a socialist. Maybe a democratic socialist.\" He wrote extensively about the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement and labor history of the United States. His memoir, You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train (Beacon Press, 2002), was also the title of a 2004 documentary about Zinn's life and work. Zinn died of a heart attack in 2010, at age 87." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Zinn> .

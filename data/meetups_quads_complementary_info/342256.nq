<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monty_Hall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Monty Hall OC, OM (born Monte Halparin; August 25, 1921 â€“ September 30, 2017) was a Canadian radio and television show host who moved to the United States in 1955 to pursue a career in broadcasting. After working as a radio newsreader and sportscaster, Hall returned to television in the U.S., this time in game shows. Starting in 1963, he was best known as the game show host and producer of Let's Make a Deal. As a celebrity, he had a conundrum with game theory and psychology aspects named after him: the Monty Hall problem. Behind the scenes, Hall also carried on an active life of philanthropy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monty_Hall> .

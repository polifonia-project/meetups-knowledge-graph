<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laurie_Anderson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Laurel Philips Anderson (born June 5, 1947), known as Laurie Anderson, is an American avant-garde artist, composer, musician, and film director whose work spans performance art, pop music, and multimedia projects. Initially trained in violin and sculpting, Anderson pursued a variety of performance art projects in New York during the 1970s, focusing particularly on language, technology, and visual imagery. She became more widely known outside the art world when her single \"O Superman\" reached number two on the UK singles chart in 1981. Her debut album Big Science was released the following year. She also starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave. Anderson is a pioneer in electronic music and has invented several devices that she has used in her recordings and performance art shows. In 1977, she created a tape-bow violin that uses recorded magnetic tape on the bow instead of horsehair and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. In the late 1990s, she collaborated with Interval Research to develop an instrument she called a \"talking stick,\" a six-foot (1.8 m) long baton-like MIDI controller that can access and replicate sounds. Anderson met singer-songwriter Lou Reed in 1992, and she was married to him from April 2008 until his death in 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laurie_Anderson> .

She was one of Canada's leading accompanists, chamber musicians and soloists. She trained in Calgary and Austria and won the 3rd prize at the ARD International Music Competition, Munich, for duo with her brother Andrew Dawes in 1963. Marylou and Andrew played a concert for Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh during their Royal visit to Regina in July 1973. She has toured across Canada, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Her interpretation of contemporary music has won her acclaim from such composers as John Weinzweig, Clermont Pépin, and Murray Adaskin. She has premiered works by Oskar Morawetz, Talivaldis Kenins, , and Victor Davies. After many years of studying and performing the chamber works of Beethoven written for piano and various instruments she had time to explore his vast repertoire for solo piano." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marylou_Dawes> .

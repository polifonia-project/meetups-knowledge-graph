A specialist in contemporary classical music, she was described by one critic as \"the irrepressible, incomparable, unstoppable Ms. Manning – life and soul of British contemporary music\". Manning and her husband, the composer Anthony Payne were avid supporters of contemporary British music. They founded the virtuoso new music group Jane's Minstrels and many of Payne's works were premiered by Manning and the ensemble." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jane_Manning> .

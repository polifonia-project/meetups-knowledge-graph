<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Lynch> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Steve Lynch (born January 18, 1955) is an American guitarist, best known as the co-founder and original lead guitarist for the glam metal/hard rock band Autograph. He decided to commit himself to music and mastering guitar when Jimi Hendrix died in 1970. In addition to Hendrix, Lynch's musical influences came from late-1960s and early-1970s English rock musicians such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Beatles. He initially played bass, however Hendrix's death influenced him to switch to guitar. Lynch gradually developed his signature two-handed (eight-finger) tapping technique throughout the 1970s and into the mid-1980s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Lynch> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oksana_Grigorieva> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Oksana Petrovna Grigorieva (Russian: Оксана Петровна Григорьева; born 23 February 1970) is a Russian singer-songwriter and pianist. She studied music in Moscow and completed conservatoire studies in Kazan, before moving to London. After studying music at the Royal Academy of Music, she moved to the United States, with periods spent living in New York City and Los Angeles, California. She taught music in the U.S., and patented a technique of teaching musical notation to children. Grigorieva gained attention as a songwriter in 2006, after a song that she wrote, \"Un día llegará\", became popular on the Josh Groban album Awake. In 2009, Grigorieva's album Beautiful Heartache was released; the actor and director Mel Gibson, with whom she was romantically involved and had a child, served as executive producer. The following year, the couple had a widely publicized falling-out that eventually involved highly public legal proceedings and acrimony." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oksana_Grigorieva> .

Darling has released one studio album on Decca Nashville. She also charted one single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart; \"Jenny Come Back,\" peaked at No. 69 in 1995. Darling sang background vocals on Garth Brooks' 1994 single \"The Red Strokes.\" Brooks returned the favor by singing background on Darling's album.

She also sang \"Love Led Us Here\" for Disney's Muppet Treasure Island with John Berry in the credits.

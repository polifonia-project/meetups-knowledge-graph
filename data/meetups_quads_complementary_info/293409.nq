<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoweri_Museveni> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Yoweri Kaguta Museveni Tibuhaburwa (born 15 September 1944) is a Ugandan politician and retired senior military officer who has been the 9th and current President of Uganda since 26 January 1986. Museveni spearheaded rebellions with aid of then current military general Tito Okello and general Bale Travor that toppled Ugandan presidents Milton Obote and Idi Amin before he captured power in 1986. In the mid-to-late 1990s, Museveni was celebrated by the Western world as part of a new generation of African leaders. Museveni's presidency has been marred by involvement in the First Congo War, the Rwandan Civil War, and other African Great Lakes conflicts; the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency in Northern Uganda, which caused a humanitarian emergency; and constitutional amendments, scrapping presidential term limits in 2005, and the presidential age limit in 2017. Museveni's rule has been described by scholars as competitive authoritarianism, or illiberal democracy. Press has been under the authority of government. None of the Ugandan elections of the last 30 years (since 1986) have been found to be free and transparent. On 16 January 2021, Museveni was re-elected for a sixth term with 58.6% of the vote, despite many videos and reports that show ballot box stuffing, over 400 polling stations with 100% voter turnout, and human rights violations. Museveni has recently insisted on retiring; according to a presidential adviser, Museveni does not want to preside at 80 years of age. Museveni has been endorsed by the vice president as a presidential candidate in 2026. As of 2022, after 36 years of his authoritarian rule, Uganda is ranked 193rd in GDP (nominal) per capita and 167th by Human Development Index." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoweri_Museveni> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Burnley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Benjamin Jackson Burnley IV (born March 10, 1978) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the founder and frontman of the American rock band Breaking Benjamin. As the sole constant of the group, Burnley has served as its principal songwriter, lead vocalist, and guitarist since its inception in 1999. Since signing with Hollywood Records in 2002, Burnley has composed six studio albums under the name Breaking Benjamin, three of which have reached platinum and two of which have reached gold in the United States. Outside of Breaking Benjamin, Burnley has also collaborated with acts such as Adam Gontier and Red. Burnley's lyrical content frequently and most recently consists of cryptic, angst-ridden themes that \"waffle between being plaintive and aggressive.\" Burnley has the range of a dramatic tenor and occasionally utilizes death growls and screams in his singing. IGN described him as having a \"somewhat innocuous voice that is crystal clear... fluctuating between contemplative subjectivity and growling anger.\" Burnley uses baritone guitars and drop tunings to get a heavier sound in his music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Burnley> .

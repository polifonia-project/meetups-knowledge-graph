He topped the UK Singles Chart in January 2007 with \"Grace Kelly\" and has since gone on to record four more platinum-selling studio albums (most recently My Name is Michael Holbrook released in October 2019), as well as serve as judge/mentor on both the French version of The Voice and the Italian version of X Factor. Mika also starred for two seasons in his own television variety show in Italy, , which won the 2017 Rose d'Or Award for Entertainment, and has hosted his own BBC2 Radio show \"The Art of Song.\" In 2022, he co-hosted the Eurovision Song Contest, alongside singer Laura Pausini and television presenter Alessandro Cattelan.

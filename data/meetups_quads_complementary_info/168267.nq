<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Allan_Coe> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Allan Coe (born September 6, 1939) is an American singer and songwriter. Coe took up music after spending much of his early life in reform schools and prisons, and first became notable for busking in Nashville. He initially played mostly in the blues style, before transitioning to country music, becoming a major part of the 1970s outlaw country scene. His biggest hits include \"You Never Even Called Me by My Name\", \"Longhaired Redneck\", \"The Ride\", \"Mona Lisa Lost Her Smile\", and \"She Used to Love Me a Lot\". His most popular songs performed by others are the number-one hits \"Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)\" sung by Tanya Tucker and Johnny Paycheck's rendition of \"Take This Job and Shove It\". The latter inspired the movie of the same name. Coe's rebellious attitude, wild image, and unconventional lifestyle set him apart from other country performers, both winning him legions of fans and hindering his mainstream success by alienating the music industry establishment. Coe continues to be a popular performer on the country music circuit." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Allan_Coe> .

He is the current lead guitarist of the rock band Breaking Benjamin and was the former lead guitarist of the Christian rock band Red. Rauch was also the producer for Korn guitarist Brian Welch's solo project, Love and Death, before becoming the band's bassist in 2020. According to Welch, Rauch \"has a great track record for recording, producing, writing, and being in a band\", and credits him as an inspiration for his returning to music. Before joining Breaking Benjamin in late 2014, Rauch also co-wrote several songs on their 2009 Dear Agony album, including \"I Will Not Bow\" and \"Lights Out\". Rauch is also a writer for Razor & Tie Music Publishing. Rauch has also worked with acts such as Pillar, Kerrie Roberts, Stars Go Dim, Fireflight, 12 Stones, Spoken, The Wedding, and Disciple. Spoken frontman Matt Baird expressed Rauch as a \"vital part in what 'Illusion' is and where Spoken is right now\", crediting him as \"an amazing producer.\" Rauch also worked with producer Rob Graves in scoring the film Into the Darkness." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jasen_Rauch> .

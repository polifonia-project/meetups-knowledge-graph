He was born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1925. After an adventurous escape from his native country, he moved to the United States in 1950, where he attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), attaining degrees in musicology and political science. He became professor of music at California State University, Long Beach, a position he held for over thirty years. There he founded the Consortium Musicum, which he directed between 1971 and 1993, and is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

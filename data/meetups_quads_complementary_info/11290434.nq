Kavanagh was asked to join Sigue Sigue Sputnik because of his looks and attitude, and only after that was taught to play drums by other band members. He remained with them until 1989. Later he joined Big Audio Dynamite II after Mick Jones reshuffled the line-up completely. He left the band in 1995." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Kavanagh_(musician)> .

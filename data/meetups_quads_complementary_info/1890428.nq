<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Jenkins_(writer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul Jenkins (born 6 December 1965) is a British comic book writer, screenwriter, novelist, and narrative director. He has had much success crossing over into the American comic book market. Primarily working for Marvel Comics, Jenkins had a big part shaping the characters of the company, helping via the Marvel Knights imprint to propel Marvel from Chapter 11 bankruptcy before choosing to focus on independent publications. He is also noted for his groundbreaking narrative work in the field of video games, and is recognized as one of the world's preeminent \"cross-media\" creators for his work across such multiple media as animation, video games, comic books, and film. Despite his commercial success, Jenkins is a noted advocate for creators' rights thanks in part to his early days at Mirage Studios and Tundra Publishing, where he witnessed first hand the drafting of the Creators Bill of Rights. He has spoken frequently in support of mentoring, and the need for hands-on education in the entertainment industry. Jenkins is the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of META Studios, a cross-media development and production house based in Atlanta, Georgia. His current projects include Commissioner Gordon and Black Adam with DC Comics." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Jenkins_(writer)> .

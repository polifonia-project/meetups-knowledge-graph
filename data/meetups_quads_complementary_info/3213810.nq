<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_L._Cook> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David L. Cook (born November 11, 1968) is an American Christian country music singer, songwriter and comedian. Born to Donnell and June (n√©e Mercer) Cook, David is the oldest of six children. He has written more than 2,500 songs and has won multiple Emmy and Telly Awards. His song, \"Drop that Rock\", was featured on his album In the Middle of It All and garnered a Dove Award nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year in 1999. In all of Cook's overseas recordings his surname is Cooke to distinguish it from his work in the United States. The male members of The Cook Family Singers have always used just their middle initials as a trademark, a trait beginning back in 1885 when the first such group was formed. In 1990 Cook was diagnosed with a dissociative disorder and psychogenic amnesia reportedly brought on by an abusive father. In 1999 Cook's story was used as a lead story with The 700 Club." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_L._Cook> .

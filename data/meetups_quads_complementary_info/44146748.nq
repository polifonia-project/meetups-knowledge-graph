He is known for his films Whiplash (2014), La La Land (2016), and First Man (2018). Chazelle's breakout Whiplash began as a proof-of-concept short film, which debuted at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and eventually attracted attention from financiers who helped to finance the full-length version. The film premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival as the opening film where it won the U.S. Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic and Audience Award: U.S. Dramatic and went on to receive five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, winning three with Chazelle himself nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Soon after, he was finally able to make his dream project, La La Land, which was nominated for fourteen Academy Awards, winning six including Best Director, making him the youngest person to win the award at age 32. His films have received critical and commercial success. Aside from filmmaking, Chazelle has ventured into television with The Eddy, an eight-episode Netflix miniseries set in Paris. Chazelle's next film, Babylon, is set in 1920s Hollywood and will be given a wide release by Paramount Pictures on December 23, 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damien_Chazelle> .

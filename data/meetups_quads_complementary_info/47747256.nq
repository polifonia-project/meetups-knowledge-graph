<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anna_Gordy_Gaye> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anna Ruby Gaye (née Gordy; January 28, 1922 – January 31, 2014) was an American businesswoman, composer and songwriter. An elder sister of Motown founder Berry Gordy, she became a record executive in the mid-to-late 1950s distributing records released on Checker and Gone Records before forming the Anna label with Billy Davis and her sister Gwen Gordy Fuqua. Gordy later became known as a songwriter for several hits including the Originals' \"Baby, I'm for Real\", and at least two songs on Marvin Gaye's What's Going On album. The first wife of Gaye, their turbulent marriage later served as inspiration for Gaye's 15th studio album, Here, My Dear." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anna_Gordy_Gaye> .

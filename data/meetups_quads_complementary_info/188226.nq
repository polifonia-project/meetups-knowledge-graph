<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Moore_(British_Army_officer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore, KB (13 November 1761 â€“ 16 January 1809), also known as Moore of Corunna , was a senior British Army officer. He is best known for his military training reforms and for his death at the Battle of Corunna, in which he repulsed a French army under Marshal Soult during the Peninsular War. After the war General Sarrazin wrote a French history of the battle, which nonetheless may have been written in light of subsequent events, stating that \"Whatever Bonaparte may assert, Soult was most certainly repulsed at Corunna; and the British gained a defensive victory, though dearly purchased with the loss of their brave general Moore, who was alike distinguished for his private virtues, and his military talents.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Moore_(British_Army_officer)> .

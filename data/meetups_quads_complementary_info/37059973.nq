<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefty_Dizz> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lefty Dizz (April 29, 1937 â€“ September 7, 1993) was an American Chicago blues guitarist and singer whose recorded work was released on eight albums. As well as fronting his own band, he worked with Junior Wells, J. B. Lenoir and Hound Dog Taylor. One commentator noted that \"for wild-ass showmen in blues history ... one would certainly have to go a far piece to beat Lefty Dizz\". He favoured a right-handed Fender Stratocaster, which he played left-handed, hence the first part of his stage name. The derivation of the second part of his stage name is uncertain. According to one source, the name came from his playing the trumpet in the style of Dizzy Gillespie; another source says that Ted Harvey, the drummer for Hound Dog Taylor & the HouseRockers, gave him the nickname in reference to his \"playing jazz in the alley\". He was reputedly the brother of blues musician Johnny Dollar." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lefty_Dizz> .

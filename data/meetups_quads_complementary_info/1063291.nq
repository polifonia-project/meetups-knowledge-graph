She was a solicitor for four different firms from 1981 and 1990, before running her own practice for a decade.

While she was not cleared of wrongdoing related to that incident, she returned to the Cabinet in 2015.Collins served under Prime Minister Bill English as Minister of Revenue and Minister of Energy and Resources from 2016 to 2017.

She was elected to succeed Todd Muller as National Party Leader by the parliamentary caucus on 14 July 2020, becoming Leader of the Opposition. She led the party to its second-worst defeat in the party's history at the 2020 election, losing 23 seats. Collins was removed as leader of the National Party by its caucus on 25 November 2021, the day after she suddenly demoted Simon Bridges, a political rival, for allegations of making a since-resolved inappropriate comment in 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judith_Collins> .

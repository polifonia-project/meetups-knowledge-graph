He is best known for his distinguished theatrical career in which he twice won the Tony Award for Best Actor In A Musical. Kiley created the role of Don Quixote in the original 1965 production of the Broadway musical Man of La Mancha and was the first to sing and record \"The Impossible Dream\", the hit song from the show. In the 1953 hit musical Kismet, he played the Caliph in the original Broadway cast and, as such, was one of the quartet who sang \"And This Is My Beloved\". Additionally, he won three Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards during his 50-year career and his \"sonorous baritone\" was also featured in the narration of a number of documentaries and other films. At the time of his death, Kiley was described as \"one of theater's most distinguished and versatile actors\" and as \"an indispensable actor, the kind of performer who could be called on to play kings and commoners and a diversity of characters in between.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Kiley> .

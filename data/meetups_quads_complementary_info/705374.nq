<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassidy_(rapper)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Barry Adrian Reese (born July 7, 1982), better known by his stage name Cassidy, is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is perhaps best known for his singles \"Hotel\" (featuring R. Kelly), \"Get No Better\" (featuring Mashonda), \"I'm a Hustla\", \"B-Boy Stance\", and \"My Drink n My 2 Step\" (featuring Swizz Beatz). Cassidy first garnered attention for his freestyles and competitions as a battle rapper in the late 1990s. American record producer Swizz Beatz found Cassidy in 2002 and signed him to his Full Surface Records imprint under Ruff Ryders Entertainment and J Records, which helped him gain major recognition. He rose to prominence with his debut studio album Split Personality, which was released in March 2004 and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cassidy_(rapper)> .

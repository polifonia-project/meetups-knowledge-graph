Daugherty is also one of the founding members of the Roots music supergroup Lost Dogs with Terry Scott Taylor, Michael Roe and Gene Eugene. Daugherty began his musical career as an engineer and roadie for the band Daniel Amos. Their bassist, Tim Chandler, introduced Daugherty to Steve Hindalong and the two soon began to write songs together and eventually formed the Choir. Daugherty now owns and operates Neverland, a recording studio in Nashville, Tennessee. Daugherty's engineering credits include albums for Randy Stonehill, , Lifesavers Underground, Michael Knott, the Prayer Chain, Riki Michele, the Waiting, Sarah Masen, Pierce Pettis, Common Children, Jeff Johnson, Caedmon's Call, Buddy Miller, Julie Miller, the Throes, and others.

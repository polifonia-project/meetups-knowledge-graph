Through their production company, Sid & Marty Krofft Pictures, they have made numerous children's television and variety show programs in the U.S., particularly in the 1970s, including H.R. Pufnstuf , Land of the Lost and Sigmund and the Sea Monsters . Their fantasy programs often feature large-headed puppets, high-concept plots, and extensive use of low-budget special effects." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sid_and_Marty_Krofft> .

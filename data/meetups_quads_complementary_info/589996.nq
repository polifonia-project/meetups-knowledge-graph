<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Diamond_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Leo Diamond (July 9, 1915 â€“ June 13, 2005) was an American composer of classical music. He is considered one of the preeminent American composers of his generation. Many of his works are tonal or modestly modal. His early compositions are typically triadic, often with widely spaced harmonies, giving them a distinctly American tone, but some of his works are consciously French in style. His later style became more chromatic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Diamond_(composer)> .

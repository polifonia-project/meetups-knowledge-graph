<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Bullock> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Ernest Bullock CVO (1890â€“1979) was an English organist, composer, and teacher. He was organist of Exeter Cathedral from 1917 to 1928 and of Westminster Abbey from 1928 to 1941. In the latter post he was jointly responsible for the music at the coronation of George VI in 1937. When the Abbey's choir was dispersed during the Second World War, Bullock took up an academic career, first in the dual post of professor of music at the University of Glasgow and principal of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, and then, from 1953 to 1960, as director of the Royal College of Music in London. As a composer, Bullock wrote mostly church music, including twenty anthems and motets, two settings of the Te Deum and two of the Magnificat and organ pieces. He also published a few part-songs and other secular vocal works." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Bullock> .

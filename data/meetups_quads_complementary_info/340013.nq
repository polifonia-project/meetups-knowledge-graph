<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Dixon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Scott Ronald Dixon CNZM (born 22 July 1980) is a professional racing driver from New Zealand, who competes in the NTT IndyCar Series for Chip Ganassi Racing. Dixon has won the IndyCar championship six times: in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2020. He also won the 92nd Indianapolis 500 in 2008 from pole position. In the 2022 Indianapolis 500, he passed Al Unser (644) for most laps led all-time in the race. Dixon's 53 wins are the second-most in American open-wheel car racing history, after only A.J. Foyt, who won 67 races. All but one of Dixon's wins occurred under IndyCar Series sanctioning, making him the winningest driver in the series' history. He is also a three-time overall winner and one-time class winner at the 24 Hours of Daytona. Alongside his six series' titles, Dixon won at least one race for eighteen consecutive seasons between 2005 and 2022, and now has the record of winning a race in 20 seasons, breaking A.J Foyt's record of 18. He is the only driver to win the IndyCar championship in his inaugural year in the series. In 2011, Dixon was selected in a worldwide poll among fans as one of the 33 greatest drivers in Indianapolis 500 history. Among other notable awards won by Dixon are the Jim Clark Trophy (1999, 2001, 2004 and 2019) and the Bruce McLaren Trophy (2003, 2008). In the 2009 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to motorsport, and in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was promoted to Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. He was New Zealand's Sportsman of the Year in 2008 and 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Dixon> .

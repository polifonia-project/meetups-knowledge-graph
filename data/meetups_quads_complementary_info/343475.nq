<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Weller> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul John Weller (born John William Weller; 25 May 1958) is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Weller achieved fame with the punk rock/new wave/mod revival band the Jam (1972–1982). He had further success with the blue-eyed soul music of the Style Council (1983–1989), before establishing himself as a solo artist with his eponymous 1992 album. Despite widespread critical recognition as a singer, lyricist, and guitarist, Weller has remained a national, rather than international, star and much of his songwriting is rooted in English society. Many of his songs with the Jam had lyrics about working class life. He was the principal figure of the 1970s and 1980s mod revival, often referred to as \"The Modfather\", and an influence on Britpop bands such as Oasis." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Weller> .

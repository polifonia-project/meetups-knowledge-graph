<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ward_Churchill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ward LeRoy Churchill (born 1947) is an American author and political activist. He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007. The primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government. His work features controversial views, written in a direct, often confrontational style. While Churchill has claimed Native American ancestry, genealogical research has failed to unearth such ancestry and he is not a member of a tribe. In January 2005, Churchill's 2001 essay \"On the Justice of Roosting Chickens\" gained attention. In the work, he argued the September 11 attacks were a natural and unavoidable consequence of unlawful U.S. foreign policy over the latter half of the 20th century; the essay is known for Churchill's use of the phrase \"little Eichmanns\" to describe the \"technocratic corps\" working in the World Trade Center. In March 2005, the University of Colorado began investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in research misconduct. Churchill was fired on July 24, 2007. Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for unlawful termination of employment. In April 2009 a Denver jury found that Churchill was unjustly fired, awarding him $1 in damages. In July 2009, however, a District Court judge vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill's request to order his reinstatement, holding that the university had \"quasi-judicial immunity\". Churchill's appeals of this decision were unsuccessful." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ward_Churchill> .

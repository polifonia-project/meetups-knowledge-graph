She released four albums beginning with 1989's Floating into the Night. Cruise is best known for her 1989 single \"Falling\"; an instrumental version was used as the theme song for the television series Twin Peaks in which she appeared in a recurring role as a roadhouse singer. She reprised the role in the 1992 movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (which also featured her music), and in the 2017 revival series Twin Peaks: The Return. She was also featured in Lynch and Badalamenti's avant-garde 1990 theater production Industrial Symphony No. 1, which was filmed and released on home media. Other notable singles included \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\" (1990) and \"If I Survive\" (1999) by the band Hybrid, which featured her vocals. In the 1990s, she was a touring member of The B-52s, filling in for Cindy Wilson. Cruise was also a stage actress and appeared in the off-Broadway musicals Return to the Forbidden Planet and Radiant Baby in 2004. Her final album, My Secret Life, was released in 2011." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julee_Cruise> .

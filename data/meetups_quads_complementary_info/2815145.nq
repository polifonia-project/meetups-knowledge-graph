Her involvement in the game and anime Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, where she voiced the role of one of the characters, Haruka Suzumiya and performed and penned the theme songs and other songs relating to the series, has brought her much attention. Her single \"Precious Memories\", used as the opening theme song for the series' animated version was a success; it had a peak ranking of 17th place on the Oricon charts and charted for 14 weeks. She has since performed songs for other games and anime, including series such as Muv-Luv, Chrono Crusade, My-HiME, My-Otome, Kure-nai, and School Days.

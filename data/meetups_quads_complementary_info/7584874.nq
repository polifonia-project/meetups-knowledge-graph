<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anne_Midgette> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anne Midgette (born June 22, 1965) is an American music critic who was the first woman to write classical music criticism regularly for The New York Times. She was the chief classical music critic of The Washington Post from 2008 to 2019, prior to which she wrote for The New York Times from 2001 to 2007. A specialist in opera and composers of contemporary classical music, Midgette advocates the importance of online criticism and has previously maintained a classical music blog. As a freelance writer she published in a wide variety of publications, sometimes covering other fields such as dance, theater, film and the visual arts. She is the co-author of two books, one with Herbert Breslin on his management of Luciano Pavarotti, and another with the pianist Leon Fleisher on his career." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anne_Midgette> .

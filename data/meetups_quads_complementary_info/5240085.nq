<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dub_Jones_(American_football)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Augustus \"Dub\" Jones (born December 29, 1924) is a former American football halfback who played ten seasons in the National Football League (NFL) and the old All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily for the Cleveland Browns. He shares the NFL record for touchdowns scored in a single game, with six. Jones was born into an athletic family in Louisiana and played a variety of sports, including football, at his high school in Ruston. The team won the state championship in 1941, his senior year. Jones attended Louisiana State University on a scholarship for a year before being transferred to Tulane University in New Orleans as part of a World War II-era U.S. Navy training program. He played football at Tulane for two seasons before joining the Miami Seahawks of the new AAFC in 1946. The Seahawks traded Jones at the end of the 1946 season to the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers, who subsequently sent him to the Browns before the 1948 season. That year, the Browns won all of their games and the AAFC championship. The team repeated as champions in 1949, but the AAFC dissolved at the end of the year and the Browns joined the NFL. A tall flanker back who was both a running and receiving threat, Jones was a key part of Browns teams that won NFL championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955. He was twice named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game, including in 1951, when he set his touchdown record. Jones retired after the 1955 season, but returned to the Browns as an assistant coach in 1963. The Browns won the NFL championship the following year. Jones left football for good in 1968 and went back to Ruston, where he worked with one of his sons in a general contracting business. Jones is a member of the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame and the Greater New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dub_Jones_(American_football)> .

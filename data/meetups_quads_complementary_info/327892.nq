<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James William Johnson (born July 16, 1943) is an American sports analyst and former football coach. Johnson served as a head football coach on the collegiate level from 1979 to 1988 and in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He is the first head football coach to win both a college football national championship and a Super Bowl (Barry Switzer and Pete Carroll have since joined him), achieving the former with Miami and the latter with the Dallas Cowboys. Johnson held his first head football coaching position at Oklahoma State before becoming Miami's head football coach in 1984 and guided the team to victory in the 1988 Orange Bowl. His collegiate success resulted in Johnson succeeding original Cowboys head coach Tom Landry in 1989, a position that saw him help rebuild the team back to winning form. Johnson's tenure from 1989 to 1993 culminated with the Cowboys winning consecutive Super Bowl titles in Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII, but conflict with owner Jerry Jones led to Johnson leaving after the second championship. Following two years away from football, Johnson returned in 1996 to become the head coach of the Miami Dolphins, where he served until retiring after the 1999 season. Since his coaching retirement, Johnson has appeared as an analyst for Fox Sports and is one of the featured commentators of Fox NFL Sunday. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Johnson_(American_football_coach)> .

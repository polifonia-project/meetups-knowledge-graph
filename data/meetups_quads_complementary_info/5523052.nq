The Geraldine Fibbers recorded two albums for Virgin Records. Their first album (Lost Somewhere Between The Earth And My Home) was described as \"...a Country Feedback Masterpiece\" by Vice (magazine) Bozulich's Evangelista project began in 2006. The album was under her own name and titled Evangelista. The album was released by Montreal, Quebec-based Constellation Records and was that label's first release by a non-Canadian artist. In 2007, The Sunday Times called Evangelista \"...a vivid inner darkness which shames rock's weeping millionaires.\" On the albums Hello, Voyager (2008), Prince of Truth (2009) and In Animal Tongue (2011), Bozulich adopted Evangelista as a project name. Some consistent members include bassist Tara Barnes, keyboardist/sampler Dominic Cramp, guitarist Nels Cline, violinist Jessica Moss, organist Nadia Moss, drummer Ches Smith, multi-instrumentalist and co-producer Shahzad Ismaily. Various members of Godspeed! You Black Emperor contributed to arranging, recording and additional collaborative songwriting. The line-up of Evangelista changes each time they play or record. The Hello, Voyager album features 14 musicians over various pieces. In 2014, Constellation released Boy, under Bozulich's name, as solo artist. Her most recent album with Constellation, Quieter was released in May 2018 and is a compilation of previously unreleased recordings. Bozulich has also been involved in other projects, including collaborations with Francesco Guerri, Noveller/Sarah Lipstate and Devin Sarno." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carla_Bozulich> .

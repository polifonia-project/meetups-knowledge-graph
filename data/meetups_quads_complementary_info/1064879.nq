<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Long_John_Baldry> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John William \"Long John\" Baldry (12 January 1941 â€“ 21 July 2005) was an English musician and actor. In the 1960s, he was one of the first British vocalists to sing the blues in clubs and shared the stage with many British musicians including the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. Before achieving stardom, Rod Stewart and Elton John were members of bands led by Baldry. He enjoyed pop success in 1967 when \"Let the Heartaches Begin\" reached No. 1 in the UK, and in Australia where his duet with Kathi McDonald \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" reached No. 2 in 1980. Baldry lived in Canada from the late 1970s until his death. He continued to make records there, and do voiceover work. Two of his best-known voice roles were as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, and as KOMPLEX in Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Long_John_Baldry> .

In 2008, Mayo was recognised as the \"Radio Broadcaster of the Year\" at the 34th annual Broadcasting Press Guild Awards, and the \"Speech Broadcaster of the Year\" at the Sony Radio Academy Awards, receiving the latter for his \"ability to paint colourful pictures of location and event and his ability to bring the very best out of his guests, encouraging conversation and interaction between them while skilfully nudging and controlling them\" and for being \"a master of light and shade, handling serious and lighter issues with aplomb.\" Mayo is also a published author. His works include a book titled Confessions, based on the Confessions slot from his radio shows, and several fictional thrillers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_Mayo> .

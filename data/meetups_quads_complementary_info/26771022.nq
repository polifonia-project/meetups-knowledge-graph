As a composer, his work largely pulls on Canadian folk melodies and his compositions include classical of harmony and counterpoint. Perrault has been commissioned to write works for such notable organizations as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and the Victoria Symphony Orchestra. From the late 1970s through the 1990s he wrote a considerable amount of music for the Gerald Danovitch Saxophone Quartet. Much of his music has been published by his own publishing company, Les Publications Bonart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_Perrault> .

Having spent years studying music and playing clubs, he scored a hit with his first release, \"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\", in 1979. It was followed by a number of new wave singles, before he moved to more jazz-inflected pop music and had a top 10 hit in 1982 with \"Steppin' Out\". Jackson is associated with the 1980s Second British Invasion of the US. He has also composed classical music. He has recorded 20 studio albums and received five Grammy Award nominations." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Jackson_(musician)> .

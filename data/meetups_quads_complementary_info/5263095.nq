<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carola_of_Vasa> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Carola of Vasa-Holstein-Gottorp (Caroline Friederike Franziska Stephanie Amalie Cäcilie; 5 August 1833 – 15 December 1907), was by birth a titular Princess of Sweden and styled Princess of Vasa as member of the House of Holstein-Gottorp, and by marriage the last Queen consort of Saxony. At the side of her husband, Carola dedicated herself to the charitable development of new social institutions in the Kingdom of Saxony. With the founding of the Albert Association (German: Albertverein) in 1867 and other nursing and training institutions, she set impulses in the areas of charity, poor and sick care as well as the care of the wounded. In addition, she was involved in aid, children's and women's associations for the support of the disadvantaged. She was a recipient of the Order of Sidonia and gave her name to the Carola Medal for charity, which was named after her. Numerous places are named after her, especially in Dresden." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carola_of_Vasa> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Mills> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jon Mills (born March 6, 1978) is a Canadian professional golfer. Mills was born in Oshawa, Ontario, and spent most of his childhood in Belleville, Ontario. He developed his competitive game on the St. Lawrence Junior Tour in southeastern Ontario, and won the Ontario Junior Championship in 1996. He earned a golf scholarship to Kent State University, graduated in 2000, won the Ontario Amateur Championship in 2001, and turned professional later that year. His father David Mills served as Executive Director for Golf Ontario from 1997 to 2014. Mills was a member of the Korn Ferry Tour (formerly known as the Nationwide Tour). Mills was a member of the PGA Tour in 2008, but did not finish high enough on the money list to retain his card for 2009. He was also a member of the PGA Tour in 2006, and the Nationwide Tour in 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2007. He also played on the PGA Tour Canada in 2002 and 2003. He won his first professional event on the Canadian Tour in 2003, and it helped him win the Order of Merit for the 2003 season. Mills earned his first PGA Tour card by finishing 5th on the 2005 Nationwide Tour money list. As a rookie on tour in 2006, he only made 6 of 27 cuts, and had to go back to the Nationwide Tour for 2007. Mills finished in 4th place on the 2007 Nationwide Tour money list to regain his PGA Tour card for 2008. Mills' caddie was Randy Dietz, a teammate of Mills at Kent State. Former British Open champion Ben Curtis also played with Mills and Dietz at Kent State. Mills was appointed as the Men's Head Golf Coach at Kent State University in 2019. Mills' brother Jeff played the PGA Tour Canada and is the Director of Golf at the Wildfire Golf Club in Ontario. His sister Jennifer is the Head Women's Volleyball Coach at Clarion University in Pennsylvania." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Mills> .

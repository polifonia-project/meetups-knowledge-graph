Earning the trust of his subjects, he had extended access to his subjects both on and off-stage. Marshall was the official photographer for the Beatles' final concert in San Francisco's Candlestick Park, and he was head-photographer at Woodstock." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Marshall_(photographer)> .

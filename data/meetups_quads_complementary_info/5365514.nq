<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Muhammad_Knight> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Muhammad Knight (born 1977) is an American novelist, essayist, and journalist. His writings are popular among American Muslim youth. The San Francisco Chronicle described him as \"one of the most necessary and, paradoxically enough, hopeful writers of Barack Obama's America,\" while The Guardian has described him as \"the Hunter S. Thompson of Islamic literature,\" and his non-fiction work exemplifies the principles of gonzo journalism. Publishers Weekly describes him as \"Islam's gonzo experimentalist.\" Within the American Muslim community, he has earned a reputation as an ostentatious cultural provocateur. He obtained a Master of Theological Studies degree from Harvard University in 2011 and received his Ph.D. in Islamic studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2016. Knight presently serves as assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Central Florida." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Muhammad_Knight> .

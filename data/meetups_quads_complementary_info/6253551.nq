His film credits include Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (1967), This, That and the Other (1969), The Sex Thief (1973) and What's Up Superdoc! (1978). He appeared in two episodes of Only Fools and Horses (\"May the Force Be With You\", 1983 and \"To Hull and Back\", 1985), playing policeman Terry Hoskins. In addition he had parts in many other comedies such as: Keeping Up Appearances; Never the Twain and That's My Boy. He died from cancer at the age of 52, a month before his father, actor Norman Mitchell, and in the same year as Kenneth MacDonald, another actor with a role as a gunner in It Ain't Half Hot Mum, who died of a heart attack aged 50." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Mitchell_(actor)> .

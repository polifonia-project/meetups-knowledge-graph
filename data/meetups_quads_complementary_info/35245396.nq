Since then he has gone on to release four full-length albums, 2010's Popular Music, 2012's Different Faces, 2018's Next Season, and 2021's Expensive Sounds for Nice People. Deitcher has toured with Wolfgang Gartner, MSTRKRFT, and Bloody Beetroots. Deitcher set the trend of collaborating with unpredictable vocalists in the dance scene such as Sebastien Grainger of Death from Above 1979, Maja Ivarsson of The Sounds and Johnny Whitney of The Blood Brothers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felix_Cartal> .

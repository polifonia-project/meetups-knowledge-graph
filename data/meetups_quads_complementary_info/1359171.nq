He was the drummer for Napalm Death between 1985 and 1991, and is credited for coining the term \"grindcore\". After Napalm Death, Harris joined Painkiller with John Zorn and Bill Laswell. Since the mid-1990s, Harris has worked primarily in electronic and ambient music, his main projects being Scorn and Lull. He has also collaborated with musicians including James Plotkin and Extreme Noise Terror. According to AllMusic, Harris's \"genre-spanning activities have done much to jar the minds, expectations, and record collections of audiences previously kept aggressively opposed.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mick_Harris> .

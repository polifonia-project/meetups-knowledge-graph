He and his staff have guided, promoted or managed the careers of numerous prominent U.S. entertainers - particularly country music stars - including 29 inductees of the Country Music Hall of Fame and 10 inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Halsey and his staff have handled the careers of Roy Clark, the Oak Ridge Boys, Waylon Jennings, Reba McEntire, Clint Black, Minnie Pearl, Tammy Wynette, Merle Haggard, Dwight Yoakam, the Judds, Jimmy Dean, Mel Tillis, Lee Greenwood, Hank Thompson, Don Williams, Woody Herman, James Brown, Roy Orbison, Leon Russell, Ricky Nelson, the Righteous Brothers, and many others. Halsey has organized and presented country music performances, particularly in the central U.S., but also on the coasts and abroad. His 1976 tour, presenting Roy Clark and the Oak Ridge Boys in the Soviet Union, won praise both culturally and in diplomatic circles. Clark's return tour of the USSR in 1988 was the subject of a television documentary. The booking agency division of the Jim Halsey Company, Inc., was sold to the William Morris Agency in 1990; Halsey remained a consultant for several years." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Halsey> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Carr> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Carr (née Kenevan; March 14, 1874 – June 24, 1973), was an American film actress and was married to the actor William Carr. She appeared in more than 140 films between 1915 and 1956. She was given some of filmdoms plum mother roles in silent pictures, especially Fox's 1920 Over the Hill to the Poorhouse which was a great success. She was interred in Calvary Cemetery. Carr bore a strong resemblance to Lucy Beaumont, another famous character actress of the time who specialized in mother roles. As older actresses such as Mary Maurice and Anna Townsend passed on, Carr, still in her forties, seem to inherit all the matriarchal roles in silent films. Mary Carr appeared on the June 9, 1954 episode of the radio quiz program \"You Bet Your Life\", hosted by comedian Groucho Marx. The Carrs' oldest son, William, died at two years of age. Almost all of her children were involved in the film business and appeared with her in Over the Hill. They are as follows: \n* John Carr \n* Stephen Carr \n* Thomas Carr \n* Rosemary Carr \n* Maybeth (Mary Elizabeth) Carr m. Pete Carpenter \n* Marie Luella Carr Walsh" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Carr> .

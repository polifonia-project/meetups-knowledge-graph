<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corey_Feldman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Corey Scott Feldman (born July 16, 1971) is an American actor and musician. As a youth, he became well known for roles in the 1980s in films such as Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984), Gremlins (1984), The Goonies (1985), and Stand by Me (1986). In 1987, Feldman co-starred in the horror film The Lost Boys with Corey Haim; they became known as \"The Two Coreys\" and went on to appear in other films together, including License to Drive (1988) and Dream a Little Dream (1989). Feldman experienced diminishing success in the film industry as an adult, amid well-publicized personal conflicts with Haim over the latter's substance abuse and with Michael Jackson, who had befriended him during his time as a teen celebrity. He has been outspoken about sexual abuse of children and teens in the entertainment industry, identifying himself as a victim of such abuse." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corey_Feldman> .

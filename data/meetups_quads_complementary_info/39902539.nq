Known also for her work with social justice and human rights organizations, from 2000 to 2010 she served as the first female artistic director and conductor of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus – the world's first openly gay choral organization – and in 2010 she established Singers of the Street: a choir of people affected by homelessness in San Francisco. She became a US citizen in 2011 and in 2013 returned to Australia to serve as director of music at Queen's College (University of Melbourne) and co-artistic director of the School of Hard Knocks. In 2006 she was a grand marshal in the San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade. Her contributions have officially been recognized by the California Senate and State Assembly, and \"Kathleen McGuire Day\" was designated twice in her honor by San Francisco mayors Gavin Newsom (22 April 2010) and Edwin Lee (6 April 2013)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathleen_McGuire> .

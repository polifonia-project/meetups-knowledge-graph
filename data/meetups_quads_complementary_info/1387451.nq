He was the creator of the \"Ten Worst Dressed Women List\", an annual awards presentation he unveiled in January of each year. He published the \"Fabulous Fashion Independents\" list and an annual Academy Awards fashion review, both of which receive somewhat less media attention. His partner of sixty years, Beverly Hills hairdresser Robert L. Spencer, was also his manager. He wrote two books, Mr. Blackwell: 30 Years of Fashion Fiascos and an autobiography, From Rags to Bitches." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Blackwell> .

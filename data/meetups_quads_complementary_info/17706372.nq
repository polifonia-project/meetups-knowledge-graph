<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faryl_Smith> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Faryl Smith (born 23 July 1995) is a British soprano whose performance repertoire includes opera, classical and classical crossover. Her diverse concerts draw a wide range of audiences, and she particularly enjoys introducing new audiences to classical music. Faryl has released two albums with Decca Records both in the UK and the US and works frequently with many different charities. Faryl rose to fame after appearing on the second series of the ITV television talent show Britain's Got Talent in 2008. After the show, she, unlike other finalists, did not sign with the judge Simon Cowell's record label Syco. Smith signed a contract with Universal Classics and Jazz for a Â£2.3 million advance in December 2008, the largest ever granted to a schoolgirl. Her debut album, Faryl, was recorded from December 2008 to January 2009 and released in March 2009. Faryl became the fastest-selling solo classical album in British chart history, selling 29,200 copies in the first week. It debuted at number six and rose to number four the following week, making Smith the third Britain's Got Talent contestant to have a top ten album. In 2010, on account of Faryl, Smith was nominated for two Classical BRIT Awards and became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination. Smith's second album, Wonderland, was released in November 2009. A concept album based on Alice in Wonderland, the album was well received by critics. In addition to releasing her two albums, she was featured on a charity cover of \"The Prayer\", released in March 2010, and has performed at numerous events, including the 2009 Royal Variety Performance. In 2015, Smith began studying music at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. She continues to perform regularly, including at major sporting events, such as a Six Nations match at Twickenham Stadium in February 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faryl_Smith> .

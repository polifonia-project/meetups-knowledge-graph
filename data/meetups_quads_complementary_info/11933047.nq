Listed at 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), 185 lb (84 kg), Johnson also batted left-handed. Although he threw and batted left handed, he was ambidextrous. Whenever he was asked to give someone his autograph, he always obliged, but wrote with his right hand." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art_Johnson_(1940s_pitcher)> .

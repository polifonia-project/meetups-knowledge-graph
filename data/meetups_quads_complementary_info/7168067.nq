<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugues_Cuénod> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hugues-Adhémar Cuénod (French pronunciation: ​[yɡ kɥeˈno]; 26 June 1902 – 6 December 2010) was a Swiss classical tenor and music educator known for his performances in international opera, operetta, both traditional and musical theatre, and on the concert stage, where he was particularly known for his clear, light, romantic and expressive poised interpretation of mélodie (French art song). A master of diction and technique, his repertoire encompassed everything from the medieval chansons of Guillaume de Machaut, Elizabethan Love Songs, the sacred renaissance compositions of Claudio Monteverdi to the operas of Jacques Offenbach and the avant garde works of Igor Stravinsky, as well as recordings of lute songs. Cuénod contributed to the revival of baroque music, performing compositions by Francesco Cavalli and others. A distinguished singer of Johann Sebastian Bach's music, he was particularly praised for his interpretation of the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion. He had the longest career of any recorded vocalist or performer in history: he gave his first performance in Paris in 1928, appearing in musical comedies, later in his career gravitating more towards concert and opera, he became best known in the role as Emperor Altoum, appearing opposite Plácido Domingo in Puccini's Turandot." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugues_Cuénod> .

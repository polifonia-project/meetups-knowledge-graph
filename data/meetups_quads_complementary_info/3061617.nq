<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghalib> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mirza Beg Asadullah Khan (Urdu, Persian: مرزا بیگ اسد اللہ خان; 27 December 1797 - 15 February 1869) also known as Mirza Ghalib (Urdu, Persian: مرزا غالب) was an Urdu and Persian poet of the 19th century Mughal and British era in the Subcontinent. He was popularly known by the pen names Ghalib (غالب) and Asad (اسد). His honorific was Dabir-ul-Mulk, Najm-ud-Daula. He is one of the most popular poets in Pakistan and quite well known amongst Urdu-speaking people in India. During his lifetime, the already declining Mughal Empire was eclipsed and displaced by the British East India Company Rule and finally deposed following the defeat of the 1857 Rebellion; these are described through his work. He wrote in both Urdu and Persian. Although his Persian Divan (body of work) is at least five times longer than his Urdu Divan, his fame rests on his poetry in Urdu. Today, Ghalib remains one of the most popular poets not only in Pakistan as well as in Urdu-speaking community of India and amongst South Asians all around the world." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ghalib> .

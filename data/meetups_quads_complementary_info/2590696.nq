<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitas> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vitaliy Vladasovich Grachev (Russian: Виталий Владасович Грачёв; Ukrainian: Віталій Владасович Грачов, romanized: Vitaliy Vladasovych Hrachov; born 19 February 1979), known professionally as Vitas (Russian: Витас, IPA: [ˈvʲitəs]; stylised as VITAS), is a Latvian-born Russian singer, songwriter and actor. Vitas is known for his unique falsetto and his eclectic musical style, which incorporates elements of operatic pop, techno, dance, classical, jazz, and folk. Though somewhat debated, it is said that he has a vocal range of 7 octaves. Having achieved prominence through Russian television in the early 2000s, Vitas crossed into Asian markets in 2005. Much of his recognition outside Russia and Asia came in the 2010s, when songs such as \"Opera #2\" and \"The 7th Element\" (both from his 2001 debut album Philosophy of Miracle) and \"Smile!\" (from his 2002 album of the same name) achieved viral success; the unusual music videos for \"Opera #2\" and \"The 7th Element\" have been cited as the most prominent examples of this. Vitas has performed with entertainment labels such as Universal Music Group, and has toured extensively in several countries. He designs his own stage costumes, and employs a backing band named DIVA during live performances." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitas> .

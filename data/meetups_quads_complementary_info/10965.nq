<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fay_Wray> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vina Fay Wray (September 15, 1907 â€“ August 8, 2004) was a Canadian/American actress best known for starring as Ann Darrow in the 1933 film King Kong. Through an acting career that spanned nearly six decades, Wray attained international recognition as an actress in horror films. She has been dubbed one of the early \"scream queens\". After appearing in minor film roles, Wray gained media attention after being selected as one of the \"WAMPAS Baby Stars\" in 1926. This led to her being contracted to Paramount Pictures as a teenager, where she made more than a dozen feature films. After leaving Paramount, she signed deals with various film companies, being cast in her first horror film roles, in addition to many other types of roles, including in The Bowery (1933) and Viva Villa (1934), both of which starred Wallace Beery. For RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., Wray starred in the film she is most identified with, King Kong (1933). After the success of King Kong, she made numerous appearances in both film and television, retiring in 1980." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fay_Wray> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Jong-hyun> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lee Jong-hyun (born May 15, 1990) is a South Korean musician, singer-songwriter and actor. He was the former lead guitarist and vocalist of South Korean rock band CNBLUE. He made his acting debut in an omnibus movie Acoustic in 2010, followed by his television debut in the Korean drama A Gentleman's Dignity in 2012. He appeared in television dramas Orange Marmalade (2015), Lingerie Girlsâ€™ Generation (2017) and Evergreen (2018). In August 2019, Lee departed CNBLUE after the backlash over a private direct message towards a YouTuber, and amidst allegations of him viewing illicit videos and having inappropriate sexual conversations degrading women in the Jung Joon-young KakaoTalk chatrooms, a part of Burning Sun scandal." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Jong-hyun> .

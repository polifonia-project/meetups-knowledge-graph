Guerra was the first signing made by the Rowdies' new general manager/head coach combo of Farrukh Quraishi and Thomas Rongen. Upon signing, coach Rongen praised Guerra's ability to read the pitch, as well as his leadership skills. Guerra was named Oakland Roots SC's new head coach on December 30, 2021. On August 18, 2022, Oakland Roots removed Guerra from his head coaching position following allegations he was in discussions with Phoenix Rising FC, a rival club, without permission while still under contract with Oakland. Guerra was officially announced as the new Phoenix Rising manager on August 22, 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juan_Guerra_(footballer,_born_1987)> .

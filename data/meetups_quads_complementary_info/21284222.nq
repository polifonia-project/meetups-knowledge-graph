He was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. In 2005, Jenner appeared in the reality television series, The Princes of Malibu, which additionally featured his older brother, musician Brandon Jenner, and his former best friend, Spencer Pratt. In 2007, he began dating Lauren Conrad, a primary cast member of The Hills, and subsequently came to prominence after being cast in the series during the second season. Their brief relationship ultimately ended his friendship with Pratt. The following year, Jenner was commissioned in his own spin-off series, Bromance, in which he was intended to find another companion in Pratt's absence. However, it was canceled after its inaugural season after receiving underwhelming ratings. In 2009, Conrad left The Hills to pursue other career opportunities and was replaced by Jenner's ex-girlfriend, Kristin Cavallari. Their rekindled relationship became the central focus of the series until its conclusion the following year. In 2013, Jenner returned to reality television, appearing on Keeping Up with the Kardashians during its eighth season, which featured: his parent Caitlyn Jenner and his stepmother Kris Jenner; his step-siblings, Kourtney, Kim, Khlo√©, and Rob Kardashian; and his half-sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brody_Jenner> .

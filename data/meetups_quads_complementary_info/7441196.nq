He was killed in the Indian Army's operation on the Golden Temple on June 6, 1984. Amrik Singh was the son of Giani Kartar Singh Bhindranwale, the 13th leader of the Damdami Taksal. He was well versed in Gurbani and Sikh literature, and devoted much of his life to Sikh progressive activities. He had passed his Masters in Punjabi from Khalsa College in Amritsar after which he began research work on his Ph.D. thesis. Amrik Singh was a prominent leader of the Damdami Taksal along with Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. He contested the 1979 Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) election, backed by Bhindranwale, but lost to Jiwan Singh Umranangal. On 26 April 1982, he led a campaign to get Amritsar the status of a \"holy city\". During the agitation, he was arrested on 19 July 1982 along with other members of the Damdami Taksal. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale began the Dharam Yudh Morcha to implement the Anandpur Resolution which primarily requested more autonomy for Punjab, arguing that it was being oppressed and treated unfairly by the Indian government. As part of the Morcha, he also demanded freedom for Amrik Singh and other prominent Sikhs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amrik_Singh> .

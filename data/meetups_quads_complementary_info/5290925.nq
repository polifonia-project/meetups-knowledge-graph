Recognised as one of the most popular turbo-folk performers, Stoja is noted for her strong voice and often eccentric appearances. She released her first album, Kako je meni sada, in Lazarević Production in 1998. Later, she released her albums in the record label Grand Production. Within a short time, Stoja became one of the most popular singers in the Balkans. She is currently signed to BN Music, and has recently released songs with IDJ and Balkan Star too." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stoja> .

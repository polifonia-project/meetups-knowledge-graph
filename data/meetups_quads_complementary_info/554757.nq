He is a former member of the rock band Kiss from 1982 until mid-1984 during the band's transition out of their 1973â€“1983 makeup period. Vincent was the last member to wear a unique makeup/costume configuration, as the character of the Ankh Warrior (a design created by Paul Stanley), until he and the band were first shown without the makeup during an interview on MTV in September 1983. He founded his own band, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, which had minor hits." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vinnie_Vincent> .

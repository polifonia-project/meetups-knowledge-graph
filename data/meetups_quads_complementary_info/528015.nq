Tuba Fats was New Orleans' most famous tuba player and played traditional New Orleans jazz and blues for over 40 years. He was born, spent most of his life, and died in New Orleans, Louisiana. His music also took him on a number of tours of Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America. He was known for many years to lead a band playing for tips in Jackson Square in the French Quarter, where he gave much encouragement to younger musicians. He played professionally with brass bands such as the Young Tuxedo, E. Gibson, Doc Paulin, Onward, Algiers, Treme, and Olympia Brass Bands, and with his own band, Tuba Fats & the Chosen Few Brass Band. Tuba Fats made many important jazz recordings; notably those under his own name on the Jazz Crusade label. Tuba Fats was married to the late blues shouter Linda Young with whom he often toured in Europe. He was buried in a Catholic cemetery, St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, on January 18, 2004 after a jazz funeral." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Lacen> .

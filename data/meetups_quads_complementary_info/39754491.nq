Working together with John Boyd and Thomas P. Christie at the Pentagon, he was a member of the self-dubbed 'Fighter Mafia', which advocated the use of energyâ€“maneuverability theory in fighter jet design. Sprey was born in Nice, France in 1937, and raised in New York. Sprey was admitted to Yale university at the age of fifteen and graduated after four year with a double major in French literature and Mechanical Engineering. He later continued his education at Cornell University where he studied mathematical statistics and operations research. He subsequently worked at Grumman Aircraft as a consulting statistician on space and commercial transportation projects. From 1966 to 1970 he was a special assistant at the Office of the Secretary of Defense." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Sprey> .

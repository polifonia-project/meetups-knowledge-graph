Lovren began his career at Dinamo Zagreb before moving to Olympique Lyonnais in January 2010. He spent three-and-a-half seasons with the Ligue 1 team and won the 2012 Coupe de France before he signed for Southampton in 2013. After one season with Southampton, he joined Liverpool for £20 million. He went on to make 185 appearances for the club, winning the UEFA Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020, before joining Russian champions Zenit Saint Petersburg in July 2020. Within four months, he became the captain of the team, replacing Artem Dzyuba. Having previously represented Croatia at various youth levels, Lovren made his senior debut in 2009 and has since gone on to make over 70 appearances for his country. He was selected in Croatia's squads for the FIFA World Cup in 2014, 2018 (in which they were beaten finalists against France) and 2022, as well as UEFA Euro 2020." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dejan_Lovren> .

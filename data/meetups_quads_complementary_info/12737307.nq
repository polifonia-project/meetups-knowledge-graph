<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Fryar> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chris Fryar (born November 22, 1970) is an American drummer. He is a member of Zac Brown Band. He has also worked with Oteil and the Peacemakers, led by bassist Oteil Burbridge of the Allman Brothers Band, Charles Neville, Victor Wooten, John Popper, Steve Bailey, David Hood, Robert Moore and the Wildcats, and the blues trio, Gravy. Fryar has a music degree. In the mid-1990s he had been underemployed in a Birmingham cover band, but then joined the blues-rock band Gravy. Singer-guitarist Rob Thorworth said that Fryar raised the group's musical sophistication. In the 2000s, as part of Oteil and the Peacemakers, he was able to make use of both his jazz background and rock music sensibilities. He also became part of a later incarnation of the Zac Brown Band. He divorced his prior wife and remarried on May 22, 2010, to Holly Travis, which gave Chris two step-children: Ashley and Allison. Fryar endorses Grestch drums and Zildjian cymbals and states being extremely happy with his setup, but switches it around periodically. His main setup consists of: 18\" fx oriental china trash 14\" K/Z hi-hat pair 18\" K dark crash thin 20\" A custom crash 20\" fx oriental Crash of Doom 20\" A custom ping ride 20\" K Constantinople medium ride (used as both ride and crash)" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Fryar> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_Dragojević> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Oliver Dragojević (pronounced [ǒliʋer drâɡojeʋitɕ]; 7 December 1947 – 29 July 2018) was a Croatian singer and composer, who was considered one of the most enduring musical stars and cultural icons in Croatia with a discography that spanned nearly five decades. His style blended traditional klapa melodies of Dalmatia, a coastal region in his native Croatia, with jazz motifs wrapped up in a modern production. For his influential musical career, he reached critical and commercial acclaim in Croatia and neighbouring countries, and numerous accolades, including numerous Porin and Indexi awards. He is one of the few Croatian musicians who performed at major international venues such as Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall, L'Olympia, and Sydney Opera House. In 1995, he was awarded the Order of Danica Hrvatska for his services to culture." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_Dragojević> .

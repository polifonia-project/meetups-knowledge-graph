<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nena> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gabriele Susanne Kerner (born 24 March 1960), better known as Nena, is a German singer and songwriter who rose to international fame in 1983 as the lead vocalist of the band Nena with the Neue Deutsche Welle song \"99 Luftballons\". In the same year the band re-recorded this song in English as \"99 Red Balloons\". Nena's re-recording of some of the band's old hit songs as a solo artist, produced by the co-composer of most of them, her former Nena band colleague and keyboard player Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, rekindled her solo career in 2002. Combined with the success of the Nena band years, she has sold over 25 million records, making her the most successful German pop singer in chart history." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nena> .

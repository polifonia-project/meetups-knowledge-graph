Quang Lê has become a household name within the Vietnamese music industry worldwide, from the United States, to Canada, to France, to the United Kingdom, to Germany, to the Czech Republic, to Australia and back home in Vietnam. Quang Lê achieved success at a young age, with hits such as “Sương Trắng Miền Quê Ngoại”, “Đập Vỡ Cây Đàn”, “Đường Về Quê Hương” and “Tương Tư Nàng Ca Sĩ”. Many famous Vietnamese songwriters, such as Đinh Miên Vũ, personally write songs for Quang Lê to perform on the Thúy Nga Paris By Night stage." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quang_Lê> .

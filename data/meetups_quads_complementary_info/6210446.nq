<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Martin_(orchestra_leader)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ray Martin (Raymond Stuart Martin; born Kurt Kohn and later anglicised his name) (11 October 1918 â€“ 7 February 1988) was an Austrian-British orchestra leader. He was noted for his light music compositions. Allmusic journalist Bradley Torreano stated, \"Ray Martin created a legacy for himself in British popular music through his work with his orchestra during the 1950s. His regular appearances on radio and television kept him in the public spotlight, while his position at EMI Records made him an influential producer at the label. His use of pseudonyms has blurred the path of his career through the years, making his many contributions even harder to keep track of. But his original compositions are what really made him popular; tracks like \"Marching Strings\" have become stables [sic] of many public and city bands and orchestras since their release\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Martin_(orchestra_leader)> .

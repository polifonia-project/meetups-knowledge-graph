Born in India, he was educated at Winchester and Cambridge, studying music with several prominent composers, before taking up a career as a critic. For most of his career he was on the staff of The Times in London, where his radical views were in contrast with the paper's traditional outlook. He published many books and articles in musical journals. After leaving The Times Mann was director of the Bath Festival for a year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Mann_(critic)> .

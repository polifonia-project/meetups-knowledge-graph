<http://dbpedia.org/resource/1993_Iowa_murders> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dustin Lee Honken (March 22, 1968 â€“ July 17, 2020) and Angela Jane Johnson (born January 17, 1964) are American mass murderers convicted of the 1993 murders of five people in Iowa. The victims were related to a drug trial against Honken. Honken was involved in the manufacturing of methamphetamine, and one of his dealers was set to testify against him, so Honken and Johnson murdered him along with his girlfriend and her two young daughters. A few months later, the fifth victim, also a former dealer, was murdered. Although Iowa abolished capital punishment in 1965, the crime was a federal case since it involved a continuing criminal enterprise. Honken was sentenced to death and executed by the federal government on July 17, 2020, the first defendant from Iowa to be executed since 1963. Johnson was also sentenced to death, the first woman sentenced to death by a United States federal jury since the 1950s, but the sentence was overturned in 2012, and she was resentenced to life without parole in 2014." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/1993_Iowa_murders> .

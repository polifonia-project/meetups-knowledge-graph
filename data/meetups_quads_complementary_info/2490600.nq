His most well-known musical project is LCD Soundsystem, which first gained attention with its single \"Losing My Edge\" in 2002 before releasing its eponymous debut album in February 2005 to critical acclaim and top 20 success in the UK. LCD Soundsystem's second and third studio albums, Sound of Silver (2007) and This Is Happening (2010) respectively, were met with universal acclaim from several music review outlets. Both albums have also reached the top 50 in the Billboard 200. LCD Soundsystem was named one of Rolling Stone’s New Immortals—\"currently active (or relatively recently defunct) artists who [they] think will stand the test of time.\" In 2011, it was announced that LCD Soundsystem would disband with a final show on April 2, 2011 at Madison Square Garden.

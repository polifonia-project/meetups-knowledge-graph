<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Varina_Anne_Davis> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Varina Anne Davis (June 27, 1864 â€“ September 18, 1898) was an American author who is best known as the youngest daughter of President Jefferson Davis of the Confederate States of America and Varina (Howell) Davis. Born in the last year of the war, by the late 1880s she became known as the \"Daughter of the Confederacy\". Images of her were widely circulated when she was young, helping morale. Later in the 1880s, she appeared with her father on behalf of Confederate veterans' groups. After his death, she and her mother moved in 1891 to New York City, where they both worked as writers. She published a biography and two novels, in addition to numerous articles. Davis died from an infectious disease at age 34." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Varina_Anne_Davis> .

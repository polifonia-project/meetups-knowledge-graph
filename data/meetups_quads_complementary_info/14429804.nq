Babbitt (born June 22, 1942) is a retired United States Air Force four-star general who served as Commander, Air Force Materiel Command (COMAFMC), from 1997 to 2000. As a teenager in 1959, Babbitt joined the Ventures rock group, just before the band gained fame with their huge hit \"Walk Don't Run\" in 1960. Babbitt had to drop out because he was not old enough to play the nightclubs and bars the band was beginning to work in. Babbitt was commissioned in 1965 through the Reserve Officer Training Corps program at the University of Washington. He trained as an aircraft maintenance officer and served as officer in charge of fighter flight lines in the United States, the Pacific and Europe. He twice commanded aircraft maintenance squadrons and was deputy commander for maintenance of a European F-15 wing. Prior to assuming command of Air Force Materiel Command, Babbitt was director of the Defense Logistics Agency at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Other assignments include deputy chief of staff for logistics, Headquarters U.S. Air Force; deputy director for materiel management, Defense Logistics Agency; director of supply, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, and director of logistics for both Headquarters Air Training Command and Headquarters U.S. Air Forces in Europe. On March 1, 1998, while on active duty as 4-star general, he played live in uniform on drums with the Ventures." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_T._Babbitt_Jr.> .

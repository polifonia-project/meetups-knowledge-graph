<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penny_Ford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Penny Ford (also known as Pennye Ford, born June 11, 1964) is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, she rose to fame in the 1980s after signing a recording contract with Total Experience Records and releasing her debut solo album Pennye. The album spawned the singles \"Change Your Wicked Way\" and \"Dangerous\", which were produced and written by Ford. She garnered international fame as the lead singer of Eurodance group Snap!. Managed and produced by Michael MÃ¼nzing and Luca Anzilotti, the group released their debut album World Power in 1990, which sold over 7 million copies worldwide and became one of the most successful dance albums to date. The album contained the hits \"The Power\", \"Ooops Up\", \"Cult of Snap\", and \"Mary Had a Little Boy\", which have collectively sold over nine million records. Snap!'s hiatus saw the release of Ford's second album, Penny Ford (1993), which established her as a solo artist worldwide and featured the singles \"Daydreaming\" and \"I Lose Control\". Ford has also been a member of the groups Klymaxx and Soul II Soul. In 2006, she returned to Snap! and began touring worldwide with them. Throughout her career, Ford has sold over 16 million records." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penny_Ford> .

She is one of the most widely recognized and awarded female country singers. In all, she has had 19 No. 1 singles, including those of The Judds, making her one of the best-selling country artists of all time. Her solo albums and singles are all credited to the single name Wynonna. She first rose to fame in the 1980s alongside her mother, Naomi, in the country music duo The Judds. They released seven albums on Curb Records in addition to 26 singles, of which fourteen were No. 1 hits. The Judds disbanded in 1991 and Wynonna began a solo career, also on Curb. In her solo career, she has released eight studio albums, a live album, a holiday album, and two compilation albums, in addition to more than 20 singles. Her first three singles were \"She Is His Only Need\", \"I Saw the Light\", and \"No One Else on Earth\". All three reached number one on the U.S. country singles charts consecutively, and \"To Be Loved by You\" also hit number one in 1996, her fourth number one and top ten hit. Three of her albums are certified platinum or higher by the RIAA.

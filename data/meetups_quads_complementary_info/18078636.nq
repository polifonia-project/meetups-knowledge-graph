<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxana_Yablonskaya> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Oxana Yablonskaya (Russian: Оксана Михайловна Яблонская; born December 6, 1938, Moscow) is a Russian pianist who has had an active international performance career since the early 1960s. She began her career in the USSR and, although winning several important competitions in the West, was denied permission by the Soviet government to accept any performance engagements outside of the Soviet bloc. Frustrated by her career limitations, she emigrated to the United States in 1977. Described by The New York Times as an \"internationally known virtuoso\" and \"one of the country's most distinguished musical residents\", Yablonskaya has toured in concert and recital throughout the world and has made numerous recordings. She taught as a member of the piano faculty at the Juilliard School for more than 30 years, until 2009." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxana_Yablonskaya> .

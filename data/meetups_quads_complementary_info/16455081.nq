<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Edelsten> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Geoffrey Walter Edelsten (2 May 1943 – 11 June 2021) was an Australian businessman and former physician known for founding the health care company Allied Medical Group. Edelsten was a general practitioner whose unconventional clinics and luxurious lifestyle attracted media attention in the 1980s. He owned mansions, helicopters, and a fleet of Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis with license plates such as Macho, Spunky and Sexy. His multidisciplinary clinics – the forerunners of modern corporate medical practices – were open 24 hours, and were fitted with chandeliers, grand pianos, and mink-covered examination tables. Edelsten was struck off the medical registry in New South Wales in 1988 and later in Victoria. In 1990, he was jailed for perverting the course of justice and soliciting Christopher Dale Flannery to assault a former patient. In 2005, Edelsten and a business partner founded Allied Medical Group, which by 2010 administered 17 medical centres and employed around 250 general practitioners. Edelsten was not, however, a shareholder or owner of the company. Edelsten was the first private owner of a major Australian football team, the Sydney Swans, which he bought in 1985." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Edelsten> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Beyer_(comics)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mark Beyer (born October 8, 1950) is a self-taught American artist and former cartoonist. His comics were known for their bleak story lines, often featuring death, disfigurement, depression, and humiliation, which contrasted with his self-taught, geometric drawing style. Most of his stories were about the adventures of a codependent yet resentful couple named Amy and Jordan. Beyer made one final comic strip for the summer 2012 issue of the British magazine ArtReview." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Beyer_(comics)> .

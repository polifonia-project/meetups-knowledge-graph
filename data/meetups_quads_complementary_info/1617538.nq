Raised by a musical family, she played an assortment of instruments by the time she reached her teenage years.

During this period she became a regular on the television program Town Hall Party and performed as a musician in shows featuring Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline. Her family formed a band in her late teens which traveled overseas and entertained military bases. After marrying in 1967, Mandrell nearly ended her performing but ultimately decided to pursue a singing career instead. In 1969, she signed her first recording contract as a singer with Columbia Records. In the early 1970s, Mandrell recorded a number of singles that combined country influences with R&B–soul.

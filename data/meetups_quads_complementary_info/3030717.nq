<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Smith_(Cardiacs)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Timothy Charles Smith (3 July 1961 â€“ 21 July 2020) was an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and music video director. Smith rose to prominence as the frontman of the rock band Cardiacs, which he co-founded with his brother Jim. Besides the Cardiacs discography, Smith also produced several records including The Sea Nymphs' debut album, his first solo LP Tim Smith's Extra Special OceanLandWorld, and the album Pony with Spratleys Japs. After having a cardiac arrest and multiple strokes in 2008, Smith was diagnosed with dystonia, putting Cardiacs on an indefinite hiatus. He slowly recovered with help of a JustGiving fundraising campaign, and in 2016 he released the Sea Nymphs' On the Dry Land. In 2018, Smith was honoured with the Doctor of Music degree from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, two years before his death in 2020." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Smith_(Cardiacs)> .

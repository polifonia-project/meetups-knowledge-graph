<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Bell_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Bell (n√© Yarbrough; born July 16, 1939) is an American soul singer and songwriter. As a performer, he is probably best known for his debut single, 1961's \"You Don't Miss Your Water\"; 1968's top 10 hit in the UK \"Private Number\", a duet with Judy Clay; and his only US top 40 hit, 1976's \"Tryin' to Love Two\", which also hit No. 1 on the R&B chart. Upon the death of Otis Redding, Bell released the well-received memorial song \"A Tribute to a King\". As a songwriter, Bell co-authored the Chuck Jackson hit \"Any Other Way\" (which was a cover since Bell issued it first) as a follow-up to \"You Don't Miss Your Water\"; Billy Idol's 1986 hit \"To Be a Lover\", which was first a hit for Bell under its original title \"I Forgot to Be Your Lover\"; and the blues classic \"Born Under A Bad Sign\", popularized by both Albert King and Cream. Although he was a longtime recording artist for Stax Records, he is unrelated to the label's onetime president, Al Bell. In 2017, Bell was awarded a Grammy for Best Americana Album for his record This Is Where I Live. He performed his hit \"Born Under a Bad Sign\" alongside Gary Clark Jr. at the 2017 Grammy Awards. Bell was also featured on Rolling Stone's \"Best of the Grammys\" for that year. His music has been sampled by artists such as Kanye West, Ludacris, and Jaheim." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Bell_(singer)> .

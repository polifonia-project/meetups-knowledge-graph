<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rie_fu> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rie Funakoshi (Japanese: 舩越 里恵, Hepburn: Funakoshi Rie, born January 11, 1985), better known by her stage name Rie fu (リエ フゥ, Rie Fū), is a Japanese singer-songwriter and musician. She resides in Tokyo but frequently travels to the United Kingdom, where she is known as Rié, to record and promote her work. Rie fu's songs are often bilingual, since she is fluent in both English and Japanese. Although most of her songs are primarily sung in Japanese, many feature entire verses written in English. Of her songs written entirely in Japanese, several have later been released as English-language versions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rie_fu> .

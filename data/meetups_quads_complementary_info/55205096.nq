<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhad_Bhabie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Danielle Bregoli (born March 26, 2003), known professionally as Bhad Bhabie (/bæd ˈbeɪbiː/, \"bad baby\"), is an American rapper and internet personality. She first became known from an appearance on Dr. Phil in September 2016, in which she uttered the phrase, \"Cash me ousside, how bout dah?\", which became a viral video meme and catchphrase. In 2017, Bregoli became the youngest female rapper ever to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with her debut single \"These Heaux\". She subsequently signed a record deal with Atlantic Records and has since expanded into a reality show, a makeup brand, tours, and a music career. Bregoli released her first mixtape, 15, in September 2018. Its lead single, \"Hi Bich\", became her second single to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhad_Bhabie> .

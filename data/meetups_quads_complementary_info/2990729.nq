Asher (born May 2, 1939) is an English-American songwriter and advertising copywriter who is best known for his collaborations with Brian Wilson (of the Beach Boys) and Roger Nichols in the 1960s. Asher co-wrote eight songs on the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds, including the singles \"God Only Knows\", \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", and \"Caroline, No\". According to Asher, he mainly served as a lyricist for Wilson's songs, but in some cases also contributed musical ideas. Asher also composed jingles, such as Mattel's slogan \"You can tell it's Mattelâ€”it's swell!\", and contributed songs to The Partridge Family." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Asher> .

Nicknamed \"The Hedgehog\", Jeremy was ranked by AVN at No. 1 in their \"50 Top Porn Stars of All Time\" list. Jeremy has also made a number of non-pornographic media appearances, and director Scott J. Gill filmed a documentary about him and his legacy, Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy, which was released on November 30, 2001 worldwide and on home media and digital download on March 25, 2003. Jeremy has been accused of sexual assault more than a dozen times over the years. In June 2020, Jeremy was charged with four counts of rape and sexual assault involving four women, and in August 2020, he was charged with another 20 counts of either rape or sexual assault over a span of 16 years from 2004 to 2020 that involved 12 women and a 15-year-old girl. Upon further investigation he was indicted on 30 sexual-assault counts involving 21 victims, and as of December 2021 was in jail awaiting trial scheduled for May 2022. The trial was postponed due to mental problems, and he was committed in a psychiatric facility in March 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Jeremy> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Halladay> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Harry Leroy \"Roy\" Halladay III (May 14, 1977 â€“ November 7, 2017) was an American professional baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies between 1998 and 2013. His nickname, \"Doc\", was coined by Toronto Blue Jays announcer Tom Cheek, and was a reference to Wild West gunslinger Doc Holliday. An eight-time All-Star, Halladay was one of the most dominant pitchers of his era. Known for his outstanding durability, he led the league in complete games seven times, the most of any pitcher whose career began after 1945. He also led the league in strikeout-to-walk ratio five times and innings pitched four times. Raised in Arvada, Colorado, Halladay pitched at Arvada West High School, before being drafted 17th overall by the Blue Jays in the 1995 MLB draft. He made his major league debut in 1998, nearly pitching a no-hitter in his second career start. After struggling in 2000, he was demoted to the minor leagues, where he reworked his delivery and pitching. In 2002, Halladay established himself as a durable, elite starting pitcher, earning his first All-Star selection. The following year, he won the American League (AL) Cy Young Award and led the AL in complete games, which he accomplished five times in seven seasons, through 2009. He was traded to the Phillies before the 2010 season, and that year, he pitched both the 20th perfect game and the second postseason no-hitter in major league history, led the majors in shutouts for the second consecutive year, and won the National League (NL) Cy Young Award. In 2011, Halladay had another dominant season, leading the NL in complete games, but he was plagued by injuries the next two years. After the 2013 season, he announced his retirement as the active major league leader in complete games, with 67. On November 7, 2017, Halladay died when he crashed his ICON A5 amphibious plane into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida. He was 40 years old. The Blue Jays organization posthumously retired his number 32 on March 29, 2018, with the Phillies retiring his number 34 on August 8, 2021. Halladay was announced as an inductee to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on January 22, 2019; he was the first posthumously elected player since Deacon White in 2013 and the first elected by the BBWAA since Roberto Clemente in 1973." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Halladay> .

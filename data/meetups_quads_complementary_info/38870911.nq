He was born and died in Pistoia. He began to study music with his father Domenico, who was the maestro di cappella at Pistoia Cathedral, and his uncle Filippo Maria Gherardeschi. He continued his studies with Nicola Sala in Naples at the Conservatorio della Pietà dei Turchini. On returning to his home city he was appointed organist at the Church of Santa Maria dell'Umiltà and later succeeded his father as director of music at Pistoia Cathedral. As a composer he wrote vocal music (sacred and secular) as well as instrumental music (solo, chamber and orchestral)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giuseppe_Gherardeschi> .

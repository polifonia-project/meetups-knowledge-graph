<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dick_Biondi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard O. Biondi (born September 13, 1932) is an American Top 40 and Oldies disc jockey. Calling himself The Wild I-tralian, he was one of the original \"screamers,\" known for his screaming delivery as well as wild antics on the air and off. In a 1988 interview, Biondi said he had been fired 23 times, with both fits of temper and jokes gone wrong part of the tally. Over many years and many frequencies, Dick's closing line was, \"God bless, bye, bye, Duke. Thanks a million for dialing our way.\" Biondi gained national attention in the 1950s and 1960s as a disc jockey on leading AM radio stations in Buffalo, New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Los Angeles, California. Besides being among the first to play Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Gene Vincent, and other early rhythm and blues artists, he was also able to meet them. The early Rock and Roll era meant \"record hops\" where disc jockeys would make personal appearances at local schools and clubs; they often included appearances by the artists whose records were being played. Biondi is credited as the first U.S. disc jockey to play the Beatles, on Chicago's WLS 890 AM in February 1963, with the song \"Please Please Me\". Later, while working at KRLA (1110 AM) in Los Angeles, he introduced the Beatles and Rolling Stones at their Hollywood Bowl concerts. Since 1984, Biondi has been a mainstay on oldies stations in the city where he first earned his reputation, Chicago. On May 2, 2010, Dick Biondi celebrated the 50th anniversary of his first Chicago broadcast. WLS-AM and WLS-FM presented a 5-hour simulcast special from 7 p.m. to midnight, featuring memorable moments in his career and special celebrity guests, with Biondi as host. Biondi is an inductee of the Radio Hall of Fame (Chicago)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dick_Biondi> .

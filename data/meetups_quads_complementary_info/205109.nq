<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edwin_Starr> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Edwin Hatcher (January 21, 1942 â€“ April 2, 2003), known by his stage name Edwin Starr, was an American singer and songwriter. Starr was famous for his Norman Whitfield-produced Motown singles of the 1970s, most notably the number-one hit \"War\". Born in Nashville and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, he later lived in Detroit while singing for Ric-Tic and Motown Records. He was backed by the band that became known as \"Black Merda\". Hawkins and Veasey of the group played on most of his early hits on the Ric Tic Label. Starr's songs \"Twenty-Five Miles\" and \"Stop the War Now\" were also major successes, in 1969 and 1971 respectively. In the 1970s Starr's base shifted to the United Kingdom, where he continued to produce music, and resided until his death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edwin_Starr> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shingo_Takagi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shin Takagi (鷹木 信, Takagi Shin, born November 21, 1982), known by his ring name Shingo Takagi (鷹木信悟, Takagi Shingo), is a Japanese professional wrestler and former bodybuilder, currently signed to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he is the provisional KOPW 2022 champion in his first reign. He is also a member of the Los Ingobernables de Japón professional wrestling stable. Takagi first became known for his work with Dragon Gate, where he competed from his debut in 2004 up until 2018. He was known as the promotion's top heel for many years, and went on to become one of the most decorated wrestlers in the company's history, winning the Open the Dream Gate Championship, the top championship in Dragon Gate, four times. He was also known as the leader of the villainous VerserK stable through its many incarnations, and for his long-lasting rivalry with BxB Hulk, with whom he main-evented several prominent Dragon Gate events. He has also spent an extended amount of time with American promotions such as Full Impact Pro, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla and Ring of Honor. On October 8, 2018, Takagi made his surprise debut in NJPW as the foreshadowed sixth member of the Los Ingobernables de Japón stable. Originally performing in the Junior Heavyweight division, he went on to be undefeated as a singles competitor and overall unpinned and unsubmitted until the BOSJ 2019 final. He also held the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship once with fellow Ingobernables member Bushi from January to March 2019. Takagi moved to the Heavyweight division in June 2019, debuting at G1 Climax 29. From February to August 2020, Takagi held both the NEVER Openweight Championship and the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship (with Bushi and Evil), making him the first person to hold both NEVER titles at the same time. After losing the NEVER Title in August, he regained it in November for a second time. By winning the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship at Dominion 6.6 in Osaka-jo Hall in 2021, Takagi became the only wrestler that won the top championship in NJPW and Dragon Gate." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shingo_Takagi> .

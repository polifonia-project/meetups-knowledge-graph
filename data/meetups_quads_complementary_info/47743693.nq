Born in Louisville, Kentucky, he began his career in 2011 with a mixtape entitled Killer Instinct Vol. 1. Tiller initially gained mainstream success in 2015 following the release of the single, \"Don't\", which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The record's success led to a deal with RCA Records and served as the lead single to his debut studio album, Trapsoul (2015), which reached the top ten on the Billboard 200, and included the single \"Exchange\", which earned him a Grammy Award nomination. In May 2017, Tiller released his second studio album, True to Self, which debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200. That same year, he was also featured alongside Rihanna on the hit single \"Wild Thoughts\" by DJ Khaled, which reached number-two on the Billboard Hot 100.

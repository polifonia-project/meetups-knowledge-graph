Born in Seoul, he spent his youth living in his home country, as well as Japan, the United States, and Canada. An aspiring pianist, Seo's exposure to hip hop music in his teens led him to pursue the genre. He released a series of singles before enlisting and serving two years in military service. Seo released his first studio album Frameworks (2015), which earned him the award for Best R&B & Soul Album at the Korean Music Awards in 2016. He released his second album Ego Expand (100%) in May of that year, which earned him nominations for Best R&B & Soul Album, as well as Best R&B & Soul Song for its lead single \"B L U E\". As a solo artist, Seo released one of his most recent albums, \"My Body and My Heart\", which garnered awards for Best R&B and Soul Album. This was followed by a new release of his third album, the fourth volume of his book Eros, which garnered an award for Best Book." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Seo> .

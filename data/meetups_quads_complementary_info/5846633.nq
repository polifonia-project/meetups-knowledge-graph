<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Li_Tobler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Li Tobler (30 November 1947 â€“ 19 May 1975) was a Swiss stage actress and model for the artist H. R. Giger. Two of his major paintings were portraits of Tobler, and her face can also be recognised in some of his semi-abstract subjects where man and machine are fused into one. Tobler lived with Giger in squalor, often inside condemned buildings, eventually becoming romantically involved. Although their relationship was open, it remained deeply intense and creatively inspiring to Giger. Tobler suffered from emotional insecurity, heavy drug dependence and physical exhaustion from theatrical tours. She committed suicide at age 27 as a result of constant depression. According to Giger, she had wished her life to be \"short and intense\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Li_Tobler> .

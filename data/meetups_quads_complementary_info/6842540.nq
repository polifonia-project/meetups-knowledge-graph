Throughout his life, he was concerned with overcoming racism, inequality, and violence in society. He wrote or cowrote \"Wasn't That a Time?\", \"If I Had a Hammer\", and \"Kisses Sweeter than Wine\", which became Weavers' staples. He also familiarized audiences with songs of the 1930s labor movement, such as \"We Shall Not Be Moved\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Hays> .

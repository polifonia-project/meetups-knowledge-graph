His music is often described as progressive house, though he prefers to associate more with tech house and is sometimes described simply as \"deepsexyfuturistictechfunkouse\". At performances, he is well known to interact personally with the audience. Howells has mixed several albums for Global Underground in addition to his Nocturnal Frequencies series. Howells is also a member of the duo Science Department with Dick Trevor, which has produced the singles \"Breathe\" and \"Persuasion\"/\"Repercussion\" as well as remixes for artists such as BT. From 2008 he has run his own record label, Dig Deeper - named after his long running club night." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danny_Howells> .

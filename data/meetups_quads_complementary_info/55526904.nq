Randa is best known for their song \"Rangers\", which is used on a TV health promotion ad in New Zealand called \"Go the distance\". The video was a marketing campaign that aimed to contribute to changing New Zealanders alcohol consumption behaviour from the current norm of high-risk drinking to one of moderation. One of biggest moments of Randa's career was performing at the Auckland Big Day Out 2014. Randa identifies as transgender and non-binary." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randa_(rapper)> .

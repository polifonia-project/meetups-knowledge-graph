<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Farr> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gary Anthony Farr (19 October 1944 â€“ 29 July 1994) was a British folk/blues singer best known as the founder and lead vocalist of the T-Bones, a British rhythm and blues band active primarily in the early to mid-1960s. After the break-up of the T-Bones, Farr pursued a solo career that resulted in three studio albums and a handful of singles, none of which were commercially well received. Later he collaborated with other musicians (some of whom had been members of British band Uriah Heep) and released one album under the name Lion. Following this project, Farr made no more official music recordings." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Farr> .

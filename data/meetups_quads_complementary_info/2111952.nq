Signed to Mercury Nashville in 2003, Roberts made her debut with the single \"Break Down Here\" in February 2004, a Top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and the first track from her self-titled debut album. A second album for Mercury, Men & Mascara, followed in 2006. This album produced two non-charting singles in its title track and a cover of Saving Jane's \"Girl Next Door\".

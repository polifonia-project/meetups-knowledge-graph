<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Buckley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lord Richard Buckley (born Richard Myrle Buckley; April 5, 1906 – November 12, 1960) was an American stand-up comedian and recording artist, who in the 1940s and 1950s created a character that was, according to The New York Times, \"an unlikely persona ... part English royalty, part Dizzy Gillespie.\" Michael Packenham, writing in The Baltimore Sun, described him as \"a magnificent stand-up comedian ... Buckley's work, his very presence, projected the sense that life's most immortal truths lie in the inextricable weaving together of love and irony—affection for all humanity married to laughter.\" Buckley's unique stage persona anticipated aspects of the Beat Generation sensibility, and influenced contemporary figures as various as Dizzy Gillespie, Lenny Bruce, Wavy Gravy, Del Close, and, even after Buckley's death, Ken Kesey, George Harrison, Tom Waits, Frank Zappa, Robin Williams, and Jimmy Buffett. Bob Dylan, in his book Chronicles, said \"Buckley was the hipster bebop preacher who defied all labels.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Buckley> .

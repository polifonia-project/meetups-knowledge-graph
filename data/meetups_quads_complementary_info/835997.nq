<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joseph Lewis Thomas (born July 5, 1972), known mononymously as Joe, is an American R&B singer-songwriter and record producer. Born and raised in Ashburn, Georgia, he later relocated to Atlanta and signed a record deal with Polygram Records in 1992. He rose to prominence after releasing his debut album Everything the following year. He followed it with a series of successful albums under Jive Records, including All That I Am (1997), the international bestseller My Name Is Joe (2000) as well as the multi-certified albums Better Days (2001) and And Then... (2003). Several songs from these albums became hit singles on the pop and R&B record charts, including the number-one hit \"Stutter\", the top ten entries \"All the Things (Your Man Won't Do)\", \"Don't Wanna Be a Player\", and \"I Wanna Know\" as well as his collaborations \"Faded Pictures\", \"Thank God I Found You\" and \"Still Not a Player\". Since his departure from Jive, Joe has released most of his projects independently through ventures with Kedar Massenburg and Plaid Takeover Entertainment. In 2016, his twelfth album My Name Is Joe Thomas became his eleventh album to score a top five-placing on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while lead single \"So I Can Have You Back\" became his fourth number-one hit on the Adult R&B Songs chart over the span of three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s, and 2010s). In 2010, Billboard listed Joe at 48th on its list of the Top 50 R&B and Hip Hop Artists of the past 25 years. An ASCAP Award recipient for his song \"I Wanna Know\", Joe is a seven-time Grammy Award nominee and has been nominated for numerous other awards and accolades, including a BET Award, a NAACP Image Award, and four Soul Train Music Awards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_(singer)> .

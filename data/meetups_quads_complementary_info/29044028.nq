He was born in Southampton and grew up in Halstead, Essex. Cardle has been involved in music since his early teens and has been a member of two different bands; Darwyn and Seven Summers. Cardle rose to fame after winning the seventh series of The X Factor, and received a Â£1 million recording contract with Syco Music and later signed a deal with Columbia Records. Following Cardle's victory on The X Factor, the winner's single and his debut single, \"When We Collide\", was released. The track was made available to purchase on 12 December 2010, shortly after the show had ended. On 19 December 2010, the track debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, as well as on the Irish Singles Chart. The track also became the second biggest-selling single of 2010 with 815,000 copies sold within two weeks. In June 2012, it had sold 1 million copies, the fourth single by an X Factor contestant to have done so. \"Run for Your Life\" was the follow-up single released by Cardle which charted at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart.

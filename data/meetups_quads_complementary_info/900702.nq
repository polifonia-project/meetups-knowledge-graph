She was Playboy magazine's November 1974 Playmate of the Month. Buell moved to New York in 1972 after signing a modeling contract with Eileen Ford, and garnered notoriety after her publicized relationship with musician Todd Rundgren from 1972 until 1978, as well as her liaisons with several rock musicians during that time and over the following four decades. She is the mother of actress Liv Tyler (born 1977), whose biological father is Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. Todd Rundgren is Liv's legally adoptive father. In 2001 Buell published her autobiography with St. Martin's Press (with Victor Bockris), Rebel Heart: An American Rock and Roll Journey. The book was a New York Times bestseller.

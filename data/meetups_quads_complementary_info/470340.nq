He was the leader of the vocal group the Mamas & the Papas and remains frequently referred to as Papa John Phillips. In addition to writing the majority of the group's compositions, he also wrote \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\" in 1967 for former Journeymen bandmate Scott McKenzie, as well as the oft-covered \"Me and My Uncle\", which was a favorite in the repertoire of the Grateful Dead. Phillips was one of the chief organizers of the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Phillips_(musician)> .

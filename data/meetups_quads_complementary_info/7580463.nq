<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lebo_Mathosa> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lebogang Precious Mathosa (17 July 1977 â€“ 23 October 2006) was a South African kwaito singer. Mathosa started her career as a founding member of the popular South African band Boom Shaka in 1994 at the age of 17, after she caught the eye of music producer Don Laka at a club in Johannesburg. She was well known for her dyed blonde hair, her live shows and outrageous stage outfits, and was openly bisexual. She was frequently compared to the South African singer Brenda Fassie who influenced her career, who died in 2004. Mathosa won the Style Best Dressed Woman of the Year Award in 2001, and was nominated by FHM magazine as one of Africa's sexiest women. Mathosa died in a car crash, aged 29, after her driver lost control of her vehicle, a Toyota Prado, in which they were travelling on the N3 Highway on the East Rand." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lebo_Mathosa> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lady_Bird_Johnson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Claudia Alta \"Lady Bird\" Johnson (née Taylor; December 22, 1912 – July 11, 2007) was First Lady of the United States from 1963 to 1969 as the wife of President Lyndon B. Johnson. She previously served as Second Lady from 1961 to 1963 when her husband was vice president. Notably well educated for a woman of her era, Lady Bird proved a capable manager and a successful investor. After marrying Lyndon Johnson in 1934 when he was a political hopeful in Austin, Texas, she used a modest inheritance to bankroll his congressional campaign and then ran his office while he served in the Navy. As First Lady, Mrs. Johnson broke new ground by interacting directly with Congress, employing her own press secretary, and making a solo electioneering tour. She was an advocate for beautifying the nation's cities and highways (\"Where flowers bloom, so does hope\"). The Highway Beautification Act was informally known as \"Lady Bird's Bill\". She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1984, the highest honors bestowed upon a U.S. civilian. Johnson has been consistently ranked in occasional Siena College Research Institute surveys of as one of the most highly regarded American first ladies per the assessments of historians." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lady_Bird_Johnson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tomohiro_Ishii> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tomohiro Ishii (石井 智宏, Ishii Tomohiro, born December 10, 1975) is a Japanese professional wrestler currently signed to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). He also makes additional appearances for All Elite Wrestling (AEW). He is also known for his work with the independent Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling (Riki Pro) promotion, where he worked backstage as the chairman. Though pushed for most of his career as an undercarder without any major championship wins, Ishii gathered a cult following, and in February 2013 was called \"probably [one of the] most underrated guys in the business\" by Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Ishii's status in NJPW finally began rising in early 2013, culminating in him winning his first title in the promotion, the NEVER Openweight Championship, in February 2014, a title he would later win a record six times. He went on to capture the IWGP Tag Team Championship on one occasion and the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship twice. Through NJPW's working relationship with the American Ring of Honor (ROH) and the British Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW) promotions, he has also won the ROH World Television Championship once and is a two-time Undisputed British Heavyweight Champion." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tomohiro_Ishii> .

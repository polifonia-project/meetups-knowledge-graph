Electronica Allah (born Timothy Elpadaro Thedford; September 19, 1976), known professionally as Jay Electronica (stylized as J A Y E L E C T R O N I C A), is an American rapper and record producer. Born and raised in New Orleans, he first received widespread attention in 2007, after the release of his mixtape, Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge). The success of the aforementioned mixtape and the stand-alone single \"Exhibit C\", subsequently led fellow American rapper Jay-Z to sign Electronica to his record label, Roc Nation in 2010. His debut studio album, A Written Testimony was released in 2020 and followed up by Act II: The Patents of Nobility (The Turn), after years of speculation and delay." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jay_Electronica> .

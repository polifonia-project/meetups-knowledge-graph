<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Taylor_(ice_hockey_coach)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tim Taylor (March 26, 1942 â€“ April 27, 2013) was an American ice hockey head coach. He was born Timothy Blake Taylor in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in South Natick, Massachusetts. He was the long-time head coach of the Yale Bulldogs from 1976-77 until his retirement in 2005-06 season. He twice took leaves of absence from his collegiate duties to coach the US Olympic Team (1984 and 1994) as well as serving as Team USA's head coach for the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships and the 1991 Canada Cup. At the time of his retirement Taylor had served as Yale's head ice hockey coach for longer than anyone else, earning more wins (337) and losses (433) for the Bulldogs than all others. The respect Taylor had earned over his career was exemplified by ECAC Hockey renaming its annual coaches award in his honor shortly after his retirement as well as the NCAA renaming its national rookie-of-the-Year award after him a few months after his death. In 2015 he was posthumously awarded the Legends of College Hockey Award, by the Hobey Baker Memorial Award Committee." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Taylor_(ice_hockey_coach)> .

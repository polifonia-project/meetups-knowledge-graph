She is a singer, songwriter, composer, music producer, DJ, and the founder of the music project Synth History and the indie record label Channel 9 Records. She also composes music for commercials, especially for Japanese brands. From 2010 until mid 2020, Johnson used the moniker Computer Magic, a name derived from a quote by Viv Savage in This Is Spinal Tap: \"quite exciting this computer magic!\". In August 2020, she announced that she changed her moniker to Danz CM. According to Allmusic, her music is \"spacy, sci-fi-influenced synth pop\". Johnson released 3 studio albums (Davos in 2015, Danz in 2018 and The Absurdity of Human Existence in 2021), 2 compilations (Super Rare in 2017, COVERS 2010â€“20 in 2020), a string of EPs and singles, plus Japan edition albums." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danz_CM> .

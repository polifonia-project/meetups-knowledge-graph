He is best known for his work as a bassist. He has worked with trumpeter Miles Davis, pianist Herbie Hancock, singer Luther Vandross, and saxophonist David Sanborn, among others. He was the main songwriter and producer on three of Davis' albums: Tutu (1986), Music from Siesta (1987), and Amandla (1989). His collaboration with Vandross was especially close; he co-produced and served as the arranger for most of Vandross' albums, and he and Vandross co-wrote many of Vandross' songs, including the hits \"I Really Didn't Mean It\", \"Any Love\", \"Power of Love/Love Power\" and \"Don't Want to Be a Fool\". He also co-wrote the 1988 single \"Da Butt\" for Experience Unlimited." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcus_Miller> .

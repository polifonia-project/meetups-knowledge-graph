<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Johnston> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bruce Arthur Johnston (born Benjamin Baldwin; June 27, 1942) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer who is a member of the Beach Boys. Johnston also collaborated on many records with Terry Melcher (his bandmate in Bruce & Terry, the Rip Chords, and California Music) and composed the 1975 Barry Manilow hit, \"I Write the Songs\". Born in Illinois, Johnston grew up in Los Angeles and studied classical piano in his early years. While in high school, he arranged and played on his first hit record, Sandy Nelson's \"Teen Beat\" (1959), and also worked with musicians such as Kim Fowley and Phil Spector. One of Johnston's first gigs was as a member of the surf band the Gamblers before becoming a staff producer at Columbia Records. In 1965, Johnston joined the Beach Boys for live performances, initially filling in for the group's co-founder Brian Wilson. Johnston's first appearance on the band's records was as a vocalist on \"California Girls\" (1965). He later contributed original material to the group's albums, including \"The Nearest Faraway Place\" on 20/20 (1969), \"Tears in the Morning\" and \"Deirdre\" on Sunflower (1970), and \"Disney Girls (1957)\" on Surf's Up (1971). Johnston left the Beach Boys in 1972 and subsequently embarked on a solo career. During this time, Johnston recorded one solo album, Going Public (1977), his last to date. In late 1978, he rejoined the Beach Boys to co-produce the group's L.A. (Light Album) (1979). Since then, he has continued to tour as a member of the band." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Johnston> .

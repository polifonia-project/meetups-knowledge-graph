He was also in a band called Suite 19 with Gary Holland, who was later replaced by Tommy Lee. Leon is considered an influential and important musical personality in the Hollywood Hard Rock/Heavy Metal scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, playing an integral part in the successive fortunes of the acts he was associated with." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greg_Leon> .

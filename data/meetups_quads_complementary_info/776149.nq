<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Hughes_(critic)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Studley Forrest Hughes AO (28 July 1938 â€“ 6 August 2012) was an Australian-born art critic, writer, and producer of television documentaries. He was described in 1997 by Robert Boynton of The New York Times as \"the most famous art critic in the world.\" Hughes earned widespread recognition for his book and television series on modern art, The Shock of the New, and for his longstanding position as art critic with TIME magazine. He is also known for his best seller The Fatal Shore (1986), a study of the British convict system in early Australian history. Known for his contentious critiques of art and artists, Hughes was generally conservative in his tastes, although he did not belong to a particular philosophical camp. His writing was noted for its power and elegance." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Hughes_(critic)> .

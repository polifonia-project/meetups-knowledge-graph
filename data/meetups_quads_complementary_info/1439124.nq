<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_Sam> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Samuel Gene Maghett (February 14, 1937 â€“ December 1, 1969), known as Magic Sam, was an American Chicago blues musician. He was born in Grenada County, Mississippi, and learned to play the blues from listening to records by Muddy Waters and Little Walter. After moving to Chicago at the age of 19, he was signed by Cobra Records and became well known as a bluesman after the release of his first record, \"All Your Love\", in 1957. He was known for his distinctive tremolo guitar playing. The stage name Magic Sam was devised by Sam's bass player and childhood friend Mack Thompson at Sam's first recording session for Cobra, as an approximation of \"Maghett Sam\". The name Sam was using at the time, Good Rocking Sam, was already being used by another artist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magic_Sam> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ma_Sicong> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ma Sicong (simplified Chinese: 马思聪; traditional Chinese: 馬思聰; pinyin: Mǎ Sīcōng; Wade–Giles: Ma Szu-ts'ung; May 7, 1912 – May 20, 1987) was a Chinese violinist and composer. He was referred to in China as \"The King of Violinists.\" His Nostalgia (思鄉曲) for violin, composed in 1937 as part of the Inner Mongolia Suite (內蒙組曲), is considered one of the most favorite pieces of 20th century China. In early 1932, Ma returned to China, and got married in the same year to Wang Muli (王慕理). In the following period, he composed many renowned pieces such as Lullaby, Inner Mongolia suite, Tibet tone poem (西藏音詩), and Madrigal (牧歌). Ma was appointed president of the newly established Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing by the government of the People's Republic of China in December 1949. When the Cultural Revolution broke out in June 1966, Ma became a target of the Chinese government and its Red Guards. On the night of January 15, 1967, Ma and his family managed to escape to Hong Kong by boat. While in Hong Kong, Ma contacted Nancy Zi (Hsu Meifen 徐美芬), daughter of Ma's eldest sister Ma Sijin (马思锦). On behalf of Ma reuniting with his youngest brother Ma Sihong (马思宏) in New York City, Zi contacted the US Consulate in Hong Kong, leading to Ma's escape to the United States with escorts provided by the consulate itself. In May 1967, a special file was opened to investigate the circumstances of Ma's escape, under the leadership of Kang Sheng, head of the Central Investigation Agency, and Xie Fuzhi, the Minister of Public Security. Many of Ma's friends and family members were subsequently implicated. In 1968, a standing warrant was issued for Ma's arrest for treason, and the charge was not retracted until 1985." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ma_Sicong> .

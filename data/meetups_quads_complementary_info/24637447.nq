He also performed with other artists such as Rod Stewart in 1991 and James Taylor in 1994 and since 2019, filling in for Arnold McCuller and eventually replacing the late David Lasley.

Next year he worked with Jackson for the last time, in preparation for the entertainer's ill-fated concert series This Is It.

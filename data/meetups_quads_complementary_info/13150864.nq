Klinghoffer took the place of his friend and frequent collaborator John Frusciante in 2009, after a period as a touring member. Klinghoffer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2012, becoming the Hall of Fame's youngest-ever living inductee at the time, at age 32, passing Stevie Wonder, who was 38 when he was inducted. In 2020, Klinghoffer joined Pearl Jam in a touring and session capacity, performing guitar, additional percussion and backing vocals on their tour in support of Gigaton (2020). That same year he joined frontman Eddie Vedder's solo band, the Earthlings, alongside his former Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmate Chad Smith. A multi-instrumentalist, Klinghoffer also fronts the alternative rock band Dot Hacker, a group made up of former touring members of Gnarls Barkley. He is also a former member of the bands Ataxia, Warpaint and The Bicycle Thief. Klinghoffer most commonly plays guitar or drums, and sings backup as well as lead vocals. He has also both recorded and toured as a session musician with notable artists including PJ Harvey, Beck, Lana Del Rey, the Butthole Surfers, Vincent Gallo, Sparks, Golden Shoulders and Cate Le Bon. Klinghoffer also releases solo materials under the pseudonym of Pluralone, originally a working title for the group Dot Hacker. He has released three solo albums, To Be One with You (2019), I Don't Feel Well (2020) and This Is the Show (2022) plus multiple non-album singles and b-sides under the name Pluralone." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Klinghoffer> .

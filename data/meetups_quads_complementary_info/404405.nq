<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebbie_Jackson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Maureen Reillette \"Rebbie\" Jackson-Brown (/ˈriːbi/; born May 29, 1950) is an American singer, actress, and the eldest child of the Jackson family of musicians. She first performed on stage with her siblings during shows in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in 1974, before subsequently appearing in the television series The Jacksons. Her sister La Toya was born on her sixth birthday. At age 34, Jackson released her debut album Centipede (1984). The album featured songs written by Smokey Robinson, Prince, and Jackson's younger brother Michael, whose contribution (the title track \"Centipede\") became Rebbie's most successful single release. By the end of the 1980s, the singer had released two more albums in quick succession: Reaction (1986) and R U Tuff Enuff (1988). Following a 7-year hiatus in her musical career, Jackson returned with a cover of \"Forever Young\" for the Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home soundtrack before the release of the 1998 album Yours Faithfully three years later. The production of the album, her last to date, was a collaboration with artists and producers such as Men of Vizion's Spanky Williams, Keith Thomas, and Eliot Kennedy. It also featured contributions from her children. In 2011, Rebbie embarked on the Pick Up the Phone Tour, which is dedicated to teens from all over the U.S. who have committed suicide." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebbie_Jackson> .

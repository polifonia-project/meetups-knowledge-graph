<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Murphy_(ice_hockey)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joseph Patrick Murphy (born October 16, 1967) is a Canadian former professional hockey player who was chosen first overall in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. Murphy won Calder Cup and NCAA championships before reaching the NHL. Although Murphy struggled to make the expected impact after being selected first overall by the Detroit Red Wings, he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in 1989. His production began to increase significantly in the 1990 playoffs to help Edmonton win their fifth Stanley Cup in seven seasons, and this success continued through his time in Edmonton. A contract dispute led to a trade to the Chicago Blackhawks in 1993, where he remained very productive. Murphy's later years were spent with the St. Louis Blues, San Jose Sharks, Boston Bruins, and Washington Capitals." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Murphy_(ice_hockey)> .

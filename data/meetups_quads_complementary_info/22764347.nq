Lafertin was born in Kortrijk, Belgiuma in the Manouche Romani community and took up guitar at the age of five. After performing in a family band with his father on violin and his brother on second guitar, he joined the Piotto Limberger orchestra. He also toured with his uncle, Eddie Ferret. In the 1970s and '80s he was lead acoustic guitarist with the band \"Waso\", with Albert \"Vivi\" Limberger on rhythm guitar, Koen De Cauter on reeds (clarinet and saxophone) and vocals, and Michel Verstraeten on double bass. In 1985 he began a quartet which has featured Rudi Brink, Tim Kliphuis, and Joop Hendricks. He based the quartet on the Quintette du Hot Club de France. He began a solo career and toured throughout Europe and the UK. He has played with American jazz musicians such as Charlie Byrd, Al Casey, Scott Hamilton, Milt Hinton, and Benny Waters. Briefly he performed with St√©phane Grappelli. Lafertin has used the 12-string guitarra, combining Portuguese fado and Brazilian samba with the music of Reinhardt, Duke Ellington, and the Great American Songbook in his repertoire." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fapy_Lafertin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_Hawes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Elizabeth Hawes (December 16, 1903 â€“ September 6, 1971) was an American clothing designer, outspoken critic of the fashion industry, and champion of ready to wear and people's right to have the clothes they desired, rather than the clothes dictated to be fashionable, an idea encapsulated in her book Fashion Is Spinach, published in 1938. She was among the first Americans to establish their reputations outside of Paris haute couture. In addition to her work in the fashion industry as a sketcher, copyist, stylist, and journalist, and designer, she was an author, union organizer, champion of gender equality, and political activist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_Hawes> .

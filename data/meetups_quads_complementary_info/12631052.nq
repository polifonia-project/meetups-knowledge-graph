<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Kent_(wrestler)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Leo Joseph \"Joe\" Smith Jr. (June 24, 1933 â€“ June 7, 1993) was an American professional wrestler who wrestled as Don Kent and also as The Black Dragon, Doug Kent, Joe Smith and Super Medico III during his 36 years in professional wrestling. Don Kent is one half of The Fabulous Kangaroos alongside partners Al Costello, Bruno Bekkar or Johnny Heffernan. Despite being born in America, Kent was billed as Australian when he competed as a Kangaroo using the Kangaroos' \"Ultra Australian\" gimmick, complete with boomerangs, bush hats and \"Waltzing Matilda\" as their entrance music. When Kent was not one half of the Kangaroos, he mainly worked as \"Bulldog\" Don Kent in NWA Mid-America and Big Time Wrestling in the singles and the tag team divisions until his retirement in 1986." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Kent_(wrestler)> .

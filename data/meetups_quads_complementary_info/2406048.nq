<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Rostand> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jean Edmond Cyrus Rostand (30 October 1894, Paris â€“ 4 September 1977, Ville-d'Avray) was a French biologist, historian of science, and philosopher. Active as an experimental biologist, Rostand became famous for his work as a science writer, as well as a philosopher and an activist. His scientific work covered a variety of biological fields such as amphibian embryology, parthenogenesis and teratogeny, while his literary output extended into popular science, history of science and philosophy. His work in the area of cryogenics gave the idea of cryonics to Robert Ettinger. He took an interest in ethics and morality in biology and wrote against pseudoscience, the use of science for war, wrote against racism and supported human equality and freedom. Rostand Island in Antarctica is named after him." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Rostand> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_McLellan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert McLellan OBE (1907–1985) was a Scottish renaissance dramatist, writer and poet and a leading figure in the twentieth century movement to recover Scotland’s distinctive theatrical traditions. He found popular success with plays and stories written in his native Scots tongue and is regarded, alongside William Lorimer, as one of the most important modern exponents of fine prose in the language. In addition to his literary career, McLellan saw active service during World War II, served as an elected councillor for the Isle of Arran, his adopted home after marriage, and was active variously in the League of Dramatists, the Society of Authors and the Lallans Society. In the early 1960s he served briefly as elected President for the District Councils Association for Scotland. He was also a frequent campaigner in defence of local heritage and a dedicated beekeeper. McLellan today in literature is probably best remembered for the historical comedies, Jamie the Saxt and , and for his short story cycle, Linmill Stories, but his stage-writing career was a long and experimental one spanning over thirty years of crucial development for Scottish theatrical self-expression. In his later career he also wrote for radio and television. He was awarded a Civil List Pension in 1968 for \"services to literature in Scotland\" and received the Order of the British Empire in 1978." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_McLellan> .

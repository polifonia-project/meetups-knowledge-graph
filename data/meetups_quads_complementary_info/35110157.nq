In 2006, she became a contestant on JYP Entertainment's Superstar Survival. Although she didn't win, she was accepted as a trainee at JYP Entertainment. After two years of training, Joo debuted as a soloist with her single album Young Girl in January 2008. However, she resumed training for two years, as she didn't feel ready for her debut. Joo later returned in January 2011 by releasing her EP Heartmade. Aside from her music career, Joo has participated in various musical dramas, including Youthful March (2011–2012), Catch Me If You Can (2012–2013), and Full House (2014). She also participated in notable TV drama Dream High (2011) and the movie Marriage Blue (2013)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joo_(singer)> .

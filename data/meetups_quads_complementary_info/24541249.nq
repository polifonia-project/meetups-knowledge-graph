He was born in Chicago and died in White Plains, New York. A graduate of the Chicago College of Music, Wethington worked under pianist in the mid-1920s before taking a position in Carroll Dickerson's band in 1928; in 1929 this ensemble played with Louis Armstrong in New York City. Between 1930 and 1936 he played with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band, recording several times with the group.

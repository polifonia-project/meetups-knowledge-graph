Q magazine ranked Gahan No. 73 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Singers\" and No. 27 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Frontmen\". Gahan is known for his \"commanding presence on stage\" and his \"huge, deep baritone voice\". In 2020, Gahan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Depeche Mode. Although his bandmate Martin Gore continues to be the main songwriter for Depeche Mode, Gahan has contributed a number of songs to the albums Playing the Angel (2005), Sounds of the Universe (2009), Delta Machine (2013), and Spirit (2017). Four of these songs were released as singles, including \"Suffer Well\" in 2005, \"Hole to Feed\" in 2009, \"Should Be Higher\" in 2013, and \"Cover Me\" in 2017. Gahan's albums as a solo artist are Paper Monsters (released 2003) and Hourglass (2007). He also contributed lyrics and sang lead vocals on the Soulsavers albums The Light the Dead See (2012), Angels & Ghosts (2015), and Imposter (2021)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Gahan> .

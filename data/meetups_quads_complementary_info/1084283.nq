<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gem_Archer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Colin Murray Archer (born 7 December 1966) is an English musician and singer, best known as a member of the English rock bands Oasis, Beady Eye and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, making him, alongside Chris Sharrock, one of the only members of Oasis to have been part of both Liam and Noel Gallagher's post-Oasis projects. He is also known for his work with Heavy Stereo. He joined Oasis as rhythm guitarist in November 1999, and handled lead guitar for acoustic songs as well. He also contributed to the writing of some of the band's songs. Oasis broke up in August 2009, but in November 2009, Liam Gallagher announced he was writing new material with Archer as well as other ex-Oasis members excluding his brother Noel, under the name Beady Eye. After two albums with Beady Eye, 2011's Different Gear, Still Speeding and 2013's BE, the band officially disbanded in October 2014. In 2017, Archer joined Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds as lead guitarist, thus reuniting with former Oasis member Noel Gallagher." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gem_Archer> .

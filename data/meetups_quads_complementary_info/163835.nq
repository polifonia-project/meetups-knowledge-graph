<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Seddon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard John Seddon PC (22 June 1845 – 10 June 1906) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 15th premier (prime minister) of New Zealand from 1893 until his death. In office for thirteen years, he is to date New Zealand's longest-serving head of government. Seddon was born in Eccleston near St Helens, Lancashire, in England. He arrived in New Zealand in 1866 to join an uncle in the West Coast goldfields. His prominence in local politics gained him a seat in the House of Representatives in 1879. Seddon became a key member of the Liberal Party under the leadership of John Ballance, but differed from him greatly due to his conservativism clashing with Ballance's progressivism. When the Liberal Government came to power in 1891 Seddon was appointed to several portfolios, including Minister of Public Works. His natural leadership and confrontational manner, however, led him to quickly rise to become the man who would control the fate of the Liberal Party itself. Seddon succeeded to the leadership of the Liberal Party following Ballance's death in 1893, inheriting a bill for women's suffrage, which was passed the same year despite Seddon's opposition to it. Seddon's government achieved many social and economic changes, such as the introduction of old age pensions. His personal popularity, charisma and strength overcame dissent from within his cabinet, with Seddon defeating a leadership challenge from Robert Stout, a progressive longtime ally of the deceased Ballance who was himself Ballance's chosen successor. This has been described as firmly establishing \"Seddonism\", a colloquial term for Seddon's strand of nationalist conservatism, as New Zealand's dominant political ideology. His government also purchased vast amounts of land from the Māori, aided by his allies Alfred Cadman and James Carroll as the Ministers of Native Affairs. He spent the 1899 general election trying to relieve New Zealand's parliament of the independent politicians who had so greatly dominated the country's organised national politics since its provenance, in which he triumphed greatly. An imperialist in foreign policy, his attempt to incorporate Fiji into New Zealand failed, but he successfully annexed the Cook Islands in 1901. Seddon's government supported Britain with troops in the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and supported preferential trade between British colonies. Seddon was the second New Zealand head of government to die in office, after his predecessor Ballance. Seddon was regarded as deeply regionalist; the late Professor of History at Victoria University of Wellington, D.A. Hamer, described him as \"an intensely parochial politician...a great fighter for the interests of West Coasters but with no interest in or knowledge about wider New Zealand problems\". His heritage from the region defined him not only as a politician, but as a man; he became well-known for the \"uncouth\" stereotypes of the generally West Coast Pākehā population of the time, expressed in his lack of education, boisterous and aggressive persona, and his dialectal tendency to drop his aitches. Seddon continued to live on the West Coast of the South Island throughout his premiership, only coming to Wellington on a regular basis very reluctantly, from the late 1890s. Seddon was also described as a man of secret brooding, who secretly battled anxiety and depression beneath his public surface of rodomontade and bravado; he hid his personal struggles to ensure his enemies would not feel pleasure knowing they had hurt him. Despite his personal insecurities, dominating and almost illiberal viewpoints, and erratic nature, he inspired serious and long-lasting loyalty among his cabinet members. Leading the Liberal Party until his death, the party afterwards struggled to recover, going through a string of leaders before essentially giving way to New Zealand's modern two-party system of what would become the Labour and National Parties. Ironically, this was something Seddon had been instrumental in creating, through his successful attempt at suppressing New Zealand's previously dominant political cohort of independents. Despite being derisively known as \"King Dick\" for his autocratic style, and criticised for his actions on Māori land deprivation and his views on race (especially towards Chinese), he has nonetheless been named as one of the greatest, most influential, and most widely known politicians in New Zealand history." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Seddon> .

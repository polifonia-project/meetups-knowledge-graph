<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caroline_Henderson_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Caroline Henderson (born 28 February 1962) is a Danish–Swedish pop and jazz singer. She moved to Copenhagen from Sweden in 1983 and spent her youth singing in various jazz bands. Her breakthrough was in 1989 as part of pop group Ray Dee Ohh. After the group disbanded, Henderson launched a solo career with multi award-winning album Cinemataztic (1995) featuring smash hits \"Kiss Me Kiss Me\" and \"Made in Europe\". Follow-up Metamorphing (1998), disco cover album Dolores J - The Butterfly (2000) and the more experimental Naos (2002) didn't have the same commercial impact. A new turn saw Henderson develop into a full-fledged jazz singer on albums Don't Explain (2003), Made in Europe (2004), Love Or Nothin’ (2006) and No. 8 (2008). Henderson has also appeared as an actress in plays and films." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caroline_Henderson_(singer)> .

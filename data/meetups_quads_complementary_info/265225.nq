<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milt_Jackson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Milton Jackson (January 1, 1923 â€“ October 9, 1999), nicknamed \"Bags\", was an American jazz vibraphonist, usually thought of as a bebop player, although he performed in several jazz idioms. He is especially remembered for his cool swinging solos as a member of the Modern Jazz Quartet and his penchant for collaborating with hard bop and post-bop players. A very expressive player, Jackson differentiated himself from other vibraphonists in his attention to variations on harmonics and rhythm. He was particularly fond of the twelve-bar blues at slow tempos. He preferred to set his vibraphone's oscillator to a low 3.3 revolutions per second (as opposed to Lionel Hampton's speed of 10 revolutions per second) for a more subtle tremolo. On occasion, Jackson also sang and played piano." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milt_Jackson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_J._Clements> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alfred Joseph Clements (1858 – 6 January 1938) was the Organiser and secretary of the South Place Sunday Concerts in London for over 50 years, from 1887–1938. These concerts are still running every Sunday today. In 1901, he was a printer, living with his wife Dora Mary Clements née Varian at 10 Leighton Crescent, Kentish Town, London. When Clements died on 6 January 1938, he was living at 8 Finchley Way, Finchley London. Probate of his will was to his widow, Dora Mary Clements, and his effects totalled £995 10s. He is commemorated by a gold inlaid relief plaque at Conway Hall, London. Both Clements and his wife are named in the Book of Remembrance in the Musicians’ Chapel at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. A prize was established in his name. In 1947, this prize was won by Peter Racine Fricker for his Wind Quintet, which was first performed at Conway Hall on 27 February 1947 by the Brain Wind Ensemble, joined by George Malcolm, and first broadcast in 1949." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_J._Clements> .

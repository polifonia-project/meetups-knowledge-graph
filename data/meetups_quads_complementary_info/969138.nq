He joined the band in 1990, and stayed with them until his career ended in 2008, when he was involved in a serious automobile crash in Santa Clara, California. After the crash, he remained in a semi-comatose state before dying of cardiac arrest in April 2013. After Cheng's hospitalization, a friend of the band, Sergio Vega, became the band's full-time bassist, having previously filled in for Cheng." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chi_Cheng_(musician)> .

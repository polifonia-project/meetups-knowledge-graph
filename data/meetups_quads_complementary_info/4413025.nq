He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but split his childhood between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and New York City's Harlem neighborhood. He attended Florida A&M and, while visiting Atlanta, Georgia, worked his way into the music industry through connections with Usher, who would become one of Love's frequent collaborators.

Love's success continued writing and producing hit records such as Usher's \"There Goes My Baby\" and \"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\", Nelly's \"Just a Dream\" and \"Gone\", as well as Beyoncé's \"Sweet Dreams\". and has contributed to works which have gone on to win Grammys such as Beyoncé's 2009 Best Contemporary R&B album I Am...

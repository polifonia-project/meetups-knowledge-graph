<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barney_and_Betty_Hill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Barney and Betty Hill were an American couple who claimed they were abducted by extraterrestrials in a rural portion of the state of New Hampshire from September 19 to 20, 1961. It was the first widely publicized report of an alien abduction in the United States. The incident came to be called the \"Hill Abduction\" and the \"Zeta Reticuli Incident\" because the star map shown to Betty Hill could possibly be the Zeta Reticuli system according to some researchers. Their story was adapted into the best-selling 1966 book The Interrupted Journey and the 1975 television film The UFO Incident. In the early 21st century, plans were announced for a movie and a TV series based on the incident, although as of 2022 nothing has been produced. Most of Betty Hill's notes, tapes, and other items have been placed in the permanent collection at the University of New Hampshire, her alma mater. In July 2011, the New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources marked the site of the alleged craft's first approach with a historical marker. The Hills' story was widely publicized in books and movies." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barney_and_Betty_Hill> .

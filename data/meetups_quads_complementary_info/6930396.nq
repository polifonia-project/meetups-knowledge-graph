Playing piano and occasionally organ, Evan was a founding member of the band The Lounge Lizards, along with his saxophonist brother John Lurie. Lurie started producing music for Nickelodeon in 2001, as the composer for their show Oswald. He was later the music director for all four seasons of the Nick Jr. series The Backyardigans, which features a different musical genre in every episode. In 2011, Lurie composed an unused song for Nickelodeon's Winx Club (a show that many other Backyardigans crew members worked on, including creator Janice Burgess). Other notable productions he has written music for include Joe Gould's Secret (2000) and Steve Buscemi's Trees Lounge (1996)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evan_Lurie> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jessica_Lee_Rose> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jessica Lee Rose (born April 26, 1987) is an American-New Zealand actress who first gained popularity after playing the role of lonelygirl15, a fictional teenage homeschooled character named Bree who appeared in YouTube video blogs, beginning in June 2006. The mystery surrounding the possible fictionality of her character led to an outing by the Los Angeles Times, which thrust her into the mainstream spotlight. In 2007, Rose won a Webby for this role. After leaving lonelygirl15 in August 2007, Rose played \"Jen K.\" on ABC Family's Greek. She went on to appear in various movies, such as Perfect Sport and SyFy's Ghost Town, and other web series, such as Hooking Up and Sorority Forever. She signed on to do the independent movie Look at Me with her Lonelygirl15 co-star Yousef Abu Taleb in March 2010." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jessica_Lee_Rose> .

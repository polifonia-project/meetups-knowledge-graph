A. K. Pataudi; 5 January 1941 â€“ 22 September 2011; nicknamed Tiger Pataudi) was an Indian cricketer and a former captain of the Indian cricket team. Pataudi was appointed India's cricket captain at the age of 21, and described as \"one of (its) greatest\". Pataudi was also called the \"best fielder in the world\" of his time by commentator John Arlott and former England captain and contemporary, Ted Dexter. Mansur Ali Khan was the son of Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi, the last ruler of the princely state of Pataudi during the British Raj. After the death of his father in 1952, Pataudi succeeded him in receiving a privy purse, certain privileges, and the use of the title \"Nawab of Pataudi\" under terms accepted earlier when princely states were absorbed into independent India. However, all were ended in 1971 by the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mansoor_Ali_Khan_Pataudi> .

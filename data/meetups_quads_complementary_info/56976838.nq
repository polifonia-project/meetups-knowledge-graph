<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tallpree> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wilt \"Tallpree\" Cambridge (born 29 July 1973) is a Grenadian soca artist. He initially began performing as a reggae dancehall artist in the late 1980s and made the switch to becoming a soca artist the late 90s. His first stage name was Mr. Evilus, but by the time he began singing the popular \"Jab Jab\" – infused music soca enthusiasts have come to expect from him, he changed his name to Tallpree. In 2000, Tallpree built a massive audience in the Spicemas Grenada Carnival season with the soca song \"Grave, Jail, Hospital,\" which was named the Road March (most popular/played song) that year. Tallpree continues to perform popular soca tunes all around the world, and in 2011, he was named Grenadian Cultural Ambassador." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tallpree> .

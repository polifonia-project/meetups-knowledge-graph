In the past 14 years he has collaborated with the likes of Skepta, T.I., Meek Mill, Young Adz and many others. In 2009, he released his debut album, I Am Chipmunk, featuring four songs which peaked in the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, including the chart-topping \"Oopsy Daisy\". In 2011, Chipmunk released his follow-up album, the American hip hop-influenced Transition. It included the single \"Champion\" featuring Chris Brown, which peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart. Chip moved to Atlanta in 2012 and signed to TI's Grand Hustle Records label. On Christmas Day, Chip released \"London Boy\", featuring the likes of Meek Mill, Skepta, Movado plus more. Following his return to London, Chip embarked on a year-long rap beef which solidified his slogan \"Chip Can't Run out of Bars\". Following this, he has since released six projects, with his most recent being Insomnia, alongside Skepta and Young Adz." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chip_(rapper)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalief_Browder> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kalief Browder (May 25, 1993 â€“ June 6, 2015) was an African American youth from The Bronx, New York, who was held at the Rikers Island jail complex, without trial, between 2010 and 2013 for allegedly stealing a backpack containing valuables. During his imprisonment, Browder was in solitary confinement for 700 days. Two years after his release, Browder hanged himself at his parents' home. His case has been cited by activists campaigning for reform of the New York City criminal justice system and has attracted widespread attention in the years following his death. In 2017, Jay-Z produced a television documentary mini-series titled Time: The Kalief Browder Story. In January 2019, New York City settled a civil lawsuit with the Browder family for $3.3 million." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kalief_Browder> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Webb_Pierce> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Webb Pierce (August 8, 1921 – February 24, 1991) was an American honky-tonk vocalist, songwriter and guitarist of the 1950s, one of the most popular of the genre, charting more number one hits than any other country artist during the decade. His biggest hit was \"In the Jailhouse Now\", which charted for 37 weeks in 1955, 21 of them at number one. Pierce also charted number one for several weeks each with his recordings of \"Slowly\" (1954), \"Love, Love, Love\" (1955), \"I Don't Care\" (1955), \"There Stands the Glass\" (1953), \"More and More\" (1954), \"I Ain't Never\" (1959), and his first number one \"Wondering\", which stayed at the top spot for four of its 27 weeks' charting in 1952. He recorded country gospel song \"I Love Him Dearly\" also. His iconic hit \"Teenage Boogie\" was covered by British band T. Rex as \"I Love to Boogie\" in 1974, but credited as being written by the group's lead singer Marc Bolan and not Pierce. The music of Webb was also made popular during the British rockabilly scene in the 1980s and 1990s. For many, Pierce, with his flamboyant Nudie suits and twin silver dollar-lined convertibles, became the most recognizable face of country music of the era and its excesses. Pierce was a one-time member of the Grand Ole Opry and was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. A tribute album in his honor (produced by singer-songwriter Gail Davies) was released in 2001 entitled Caught in the Webb – A Tribute To Country Legend Webb Pierce." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Webb_Pierce> .

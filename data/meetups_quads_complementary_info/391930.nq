<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Murray> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alastair James Hay Murray (born 10 May 1968) is an English comedian, actor, musician and writer from Hammersmith. In 2003, he was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy, and in 2007 he was voted the 16th greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups. Murray was born in Buckinghamshire, where his father worked for British Rail. His paternal grandfather was the diplomat Ralph Murray, while his maternal grandfather was killed at the Battle of Dunkirk. After graduating from Oxford University, his comedy career began by working with Harry Hill for BBC Radio 4. He regularly performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, before launching his \"Pub Landlord\" persona (which he describes as a \"know-all know-nothing blowhard who knows the answer to every question even though he hasn't been asked any of them\"). This led to the Sky One sitcom Time Gentlemen Please and the chat show Al Murray's Happy Hour for ITV. He continues to perform as a stand-up and is a regular on British TV and radio." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Murray> .

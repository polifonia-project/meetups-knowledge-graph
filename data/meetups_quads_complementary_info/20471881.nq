<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alma_Moodie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alma Mary Templeton Moodie (12 September 1898 â€“ 7 March 1943) was an Australian violinist who established an excellent reputation in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s. She was regarded as the foremost female violinist during the inter-war years, and she premiered violin concertos by Kurt Atterberg, Hans Pfitzner and Ernst Krenek. She and Max Rostal were regarded as the greatest proponents of the Carl Flesch tradition. She became a teacher at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. However, Alma Moodie made no recordings, and she appears in very few reference sources. Despite her former renown, her name became virtually unknown for many years. She appeared in earlier editions of Grove's and Baker's Dictionaries, but does not appear in the more recent editions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alma_Moodie> .

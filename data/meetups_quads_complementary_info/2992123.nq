Prior to Mudhoney, he joined Bundle of Hiss when he was fifteen years old. He was also briefly the drummer for Nirvana in the summer of 1990, playing on one single, \"Sliver\", and making one live appearance with them that September in Seattle, shortly before drummer Dave Grohl joined. Peters has expressed his only regret as missing the chance to play drums on Nirvana's album Nevermind. Mudhoney's latest offering is Digital Garbage released on September 19, 2018. Peters also played drums for the Ellensburg, Washington based band Screaming Trees from 1990 to 1991, and appeared in the movie Black Sheep alongside David Spade and Chris Farley." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Peters> .

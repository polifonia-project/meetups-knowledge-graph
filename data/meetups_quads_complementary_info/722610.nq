<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linn_Berggren> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Malin Sofia Katarina Berggren (born 31 October 1970) is a Swedish singer-songwriter, best known as a former member of the pop music band Ace of Base. Having been interested and involved in music since her childhood, she formed the band in 1987, along with her sister Jenny, her brother Jonas and their friend Ulf Ekberg. Before forming Ace of Base, Malin sang in her church's choir. She was born in Gothenburg, Sweden. When Ace of Base was signed to Danish label Mega Records in 1990, Malin, or Linn as she became known, chose to put her teaching career on hold. But while her sister Jenny has stated she always wanted to be a singer, Linn has never said anything similar. On the contrary, in 1997 Linn said: \"I wanted to sing; I never wanted to be a singer\". Linn's vocal range is contralto." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linn_Berggren> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dwayne_Goettel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dwayne Rudolph Goettel (February 1, 1964 â€“ August 23, 1995) was a Canadian electronic musician, best known for his work in the industrial music group Skinny Puppy. Starting his career playing for a variety of acts around Edmonton, he joined Skinny Puppy in 1986 following the departure of keyboardist Bill Leeb. A classically trained pianist, he helped to broaden Skinny Puppy's sound with his extensive knowledge of equipment and sampling. He assisted bandmate cEvin Key on a number of side projects such as The Tear Garden and Doubting Thomas, and helped form the experimental electronic group Download. He also created the independent record label Subconscious Communications with friend and colleague Phil Western as a means to release his solo work. In 1993, Skinny Puppy moved to Los Angeles to produce their eighth studio album, The Process, through American Recordings. The production was marred by rampant drug use and band infighting, and ultimately halted in 1995 when vocalist Nivek Ogre quit the band. Goettel and Key, in an attempt to salvage the album, returned to Canada with the master tapes. Goettel went into rehab for his drug addictions and returned to live with his parents in Edmonton. On August 23, 1995, Goettel was found dead at the age of 31 in his parents' home; he had died from a heroin overdose. The Process was eventually completed and released in his memory." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dwayne_Goettel> .

He is also the lead singer of the Black Queen and Killer Be Killed, in which he also plays guitar. In 2018, Puciato and visual artist Jesse Draxler co-founded the art collective and record label Federal Prisoner. Puciato is noted for the intensity of his live performances, wide vocal and stylistic range, outspoken views, and controversy stemming from his bands' performances and interviews. Rolling Stone said that \"few singers live, breathe and often literally bleed their art like he does.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greg_Puciato> .

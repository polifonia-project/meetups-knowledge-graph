<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dogbowl> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen Tunney, also known as Dogbowl, is an American artist, musician and novelist. He was a founding member of the avant-garde band King Missile (Dog Fly Religion), and has recorded many albums as a solo act. He is also the author of two novels, the surreal, post-apocalyptic Flan, published in 1992 by Four Walls Eight Windows, and One Hundred Percent Lunar Boy, published in 2010 by MacAdam/Cage. One Hundred Percent Lunar Boy takes place on a terraformed Moon two thousand years in the future and chronicles the misadventures of sixteen-year-old Hieronymus Rexaphin, a boy who can see the fourth primary color, and the trouble he gets into after showing his unusual eyes to a teenage tourist girl from Earth." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dogbowl> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeremy_Spencer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeremy Cedric Spencer (born 4 July 1948) is a British musician, best known for playing slide guitar and piano in the original line-up of the rock band Fleetwood Mac. A member since Fleetwood Mac's inception in July 1967, he remained with the band until his abrupt departure in February 1971, when he joined the \"Children of God\", a new religious movement now known as \"The Family International\", with which he is still affiliated. After a pair of solo albums in the 1970s, he continued to tour as a musician, but did not release another album until 2006. He released further solo albums from 2012 onwards and has also recorded as part of the folk trio Steetley. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeremy_Spencer> .

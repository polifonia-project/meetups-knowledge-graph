Known for his eccentric singing voice, he first rose to prominence as lead singer and lyricist of the emo band Cap'n Jazz which he co-founded with his brother Mike in 1989. Following its dissolution in 1995, he formed Joan of Arc the same year and served as its lead singer, primary songwriter, and only continuous member until their breakup in 2020. In 2001, Kinsella participated in Owls which included all members of Cap'n jazz except for guitarist Davey von Bohlen. From 2003 to 2008, Kinsella also founded and toured with Make Believe which included his cousin Nate and former Cap'n Jazz member Sam Zurick alongside bassist Bobby Burg. He has also released early solo material under the alias Tim Kinsella(s) in addition to participating Friend/Enemy and Everyoned. Kinsella is the writer-director of the feature film Orchard Vale, which opened at the Chicago Underground Film Festival on August 15, 2007. His first novel, entitled The Karaoke Singer's Guide to Self-Defense, was published by Featherproof Books in September 2011. His second book, Let Go and Go On and On (Curbside Splendor Publishing), takes its inspiration from the late actress Laurie Bird's brief film career in the '70s, and was published in April 2014. He currently performs, tours, and writes music with his wife Jenny Pulse under the name \"Tim Kinsella & Jenny Pulse.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Kinsella> .

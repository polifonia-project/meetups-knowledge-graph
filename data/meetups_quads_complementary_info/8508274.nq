Between 1995 and 1998, he recorded for Giant Records, for which he released three studio albums: Daryle Singletary in 1995, All Because of You in 1996 and Ain't It the Truth in 1998. In the same timespan, Singletary entered the Top 40 of the Hot Country Songs charts five times, reaching No. 2 with \"I Let Her Lie\" and \"Amen Kind of Love\", and No. 4 with \"Too Much Fun\". In 2000, Singletary switched to Audium Entertainment (a division of Koch Entertainment), where he released the albums Now and Again (2000) and That's Why I Sing This Way (2002), both of which were largely composed of cover songs. A third album of covers, 2007's Straight from the Heart, was issued on the independent Shanachie Records label. He returned to E1 Music in 2010, to release Rockin' in the Country." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daryle_Singletary> .

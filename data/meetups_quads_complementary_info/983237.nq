<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murry_Wilson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Murry Gage Wilson (July 2, 1917 â€“ June 4, 1973) was an American songwriter, talent manager, record producer, and music publisher, best known as the father of the Beach Boys' Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson. After the band's formation in 1961, Murry became their first manager, and in 1962, he founded their publishing company, Sea of Tunes, with Brian. Later in his life, Wilson was accused of physically and verbally abusing his children, charges which he denied. Raised in Los Angeles, Wilson grew up in a hostile family environment due to his own father's violent nature. After his children were born, he founded a machining business, A.B.L.E. (Always Better Lasting Equipment) but maintained an active interest in music, which he passed along to his sons. Wilson authored or co-authored at least 50 compositions in his lifetime, albeit with little commercial success. His most popular songs were \"Two-Step, Side-Step\", recorded by Johnnie Lee Wills and Bonnie Lou in the 1950s, and \"Break Away\", released as a Beach Boys single in 1969. Wilson was also credited as producer for some of the band's early records, including the 1962 singles \"409\" and \"Surfin' Safari\". The Beach Boys dismissed Wilson as their manager in early 1964 due to his overbearing and disruptive presence at the group's concerts and recording sessions. Following this, he produced the sound-alike group the Sunrays, and recorded an easy listening album, The Many Moods of Murry Wilson (1967). Wilson controlled the Beach Boys' publishing until 1969, when he sold Sea of Tunes to Irving Almo Music in exchange for $700,000 (equivalent to $5.17 million in 2021). In 1973, he died, aged 55, of a heart attack. His handling of the group's publishing became the subject of numerous lawsuits decades later." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murry_Wilson> .

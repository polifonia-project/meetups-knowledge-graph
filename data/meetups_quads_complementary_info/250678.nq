<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Clare> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Clare (13 July 1793 â€“ 20 May 1864) was an English poet. The son of a farm labourer, he became known for his celebrations of the English countryside and sorrows at its disruption. His work underwent major re-evaluation in the late 20th century; he is now often seen as a major 19th-century poet. His biographer Jonathan Bate called Clare \"the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Clare> .

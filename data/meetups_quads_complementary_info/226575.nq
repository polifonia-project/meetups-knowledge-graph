<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Harryhausen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Raymond Frederick Harryhausen (June 29, 1920 â€“ May 7, 2013) was an American-British animator and special effects creator who created a form of stop motion model animation known as \"Dynamation\". His works include the animation for Mighty Joe Young (1949) with his mentor Willis H. O'Brien (for which the latter won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects); his first color film, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958); and Jason and the Argonauts (1963), which featured a sword fight with seven skeleton warriors. His last film was Clash of the Titans (1981), after which he retired. In 1960, Harryhausen moved to the United Kingdom and became a dual American-British citizen. He lived in London until his death in 2013. During his life, his innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers. In November 2016 the BFI compiled a list of those present-day filmmakers who claim to have been inspired by Harryhausen, including Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Joe Dante, Tim Burton, Nick Park, James Cameron, and Guillermo del Toro. Others influenced by him include George Lucas, John Lasseter, John Landis, Henry Selick, J. J. Abrams, and Wes Anderson." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Harryhausen> .

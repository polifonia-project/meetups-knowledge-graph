<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_McArther_Emmanuel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles McArther Emmanuel (born February 12, 1978), also known as Chuckie Taylor, is the son of Charles Taylor, the former President of Liberia. Raised by his mother in Florida until he was 16, Taylor Jr. travelled to Liberia in 1994 to live with his father, who in turn enrolled him in the Accra Academy, an elite boarding school in Ghana. He later attended the College of West Africa in Monrovia. During his father's presidency, Emmanuel became the commander of the infamously violent Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), commonly known in Liberia as the \"Demon Forces\". He is currently serving a 97-year sentence in the United States for his role in human rights violations carried out by the ATU." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_McArther_Emmanuel> .

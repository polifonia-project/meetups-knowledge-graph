<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dido_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Florian Cloud de Bounevialle O'Malley Armstrong (born 25 December 1971), known professionally as Dido (/ˈdaɪdoʊ/ DY-doh), is an English singer and songwriter. She attained international success with her debut album No Angel (1999). Hit singles from the album include \"Here with Me\" and \"Thank You\". It sold over 21 million copies worldwide, and won her several awards, including two Brit Awards; for Best British Album and Best British Female, as well as the MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act. The first verse of \"Thank You\" is sampled in \"Stan\", a collaboration with American rapper Eminem. Her next album, Life for Rent (2003), continued her success with the hit singles \"White Flag\" and \"Life for Rent\". In 2004, Dido performed with other British and Irish artists in the Band Aid 20 version of the charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\". Dido's first two albums are among the best-selling albums in UK chart history, and both are in the top 10 best-selling albums of the 2000s in the UK. Her third studio album, Safe Trip Home (2008), received critical acclaim but failed to duplicate the commercial success of her previous efforts. She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for \"If I Rise\". Dido was ranked No. 98 on the Billboard chart of the top Billboard 200 artists of the 2000s (2000–2009) based on the success of her albums in the first decade of the 21st century. Dido made a comeback in 2013, releasing her fourth studio album, Girl Who Got Away, which reached the top 5 in the UK. Having taken time out of the music industry to raise her son, she reappeared on stage at the 2013 Reading and Leeds festival where she reunited with Eminem. Dido released her fifth studio album, Still on My Mind, on 8 March 2019 and embarked on her first tour in 15 years in support of the new album. In May 2019, Dido received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dido_(singer)> .

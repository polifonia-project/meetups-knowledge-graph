Estefan has won 19 Grammy Awards. He first came to prominence as a member of the Miami Sound Machine. He is the husband of singer Gloria Estefan, father of son Nayib Estefan and daughter Emily Estefan, and the uncle of Spanish-language television personality Lili Estefan. Estefan is credited with paving the way for the crossover explosion of Latin music of the late 90s, mostly through artists that Estefan himself brought to the forefront of the US music stage, including his wife Gloria Estefan, as well as Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and Marc Anthony. Estefan received the BMI \"Songwriter of the Year\" award in 2005 and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He also received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award by the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 2009. In November 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Estefan the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. In 2019 he also received the Gershwin Prize from the Library of Congress." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emilio_Estefan> .

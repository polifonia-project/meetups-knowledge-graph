<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Goldman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jean-Jacques Goldman (French pronunciation: ​[ʒɑ̃.ʒak ɡɔldman]; born 11 October 1951) is a French singer-songwriter and music record producer. He is hugely popular in the French-speaking world. Since the death of Johnny Hallyday in 2017 he has been the highest grossing living French pop rock act. Born in Paris and active in the music scene since 1975, he had a highly successful solo career in the 1980s, and was part of the trio Fredericks Goldman Jones, releasing another string of hits in the 1990s. He also wrote successful albums and songs for many artists, including D'eux for Céline Dion, which is the most successful French language record to date. He was also part of the Les Enfoirés charity collective from 1986 to 2016, and got his most notable official recognition in the English-speaking world for winning a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997, as a co-author of three tracks on Céline Dion's Falling into You. Despite a voluntary retirement from the music scene in the early 2000s, he remains highly appreciated and influential in France." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Goldman> .

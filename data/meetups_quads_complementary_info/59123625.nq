<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Mundella> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Emma Wright Mundella (30 April 1858 â€“ 20 February 1896) was an English composer and arranger, recital pianist, church organist, choral conductor, teacher of music and hymnal editor. In her short life she published anthems, choruses and cantatas as well as songs, hymns, pieces for solo piano and for piano and other string instruments. As Director of Music Teaching at Wimbledon High School for Girls her particular interest was the encouragement of musical appreciation by young people, in pursuit of which she wrote many compositions for children and schools. Though her music is now seldom heard, her lasting achievement was her well-regarded editorship of The Day School Hymnbook, the expanded edition of which was published shortly after her early death and which brought her posthumously into national prominence." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Mundella> .

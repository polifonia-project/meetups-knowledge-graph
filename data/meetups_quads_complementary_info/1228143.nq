He was involved in Christian apologetics for a period spanning more than forty years. Zacharias was the author of more than thirty books on Christianity, He also hosted the radio programs Let My People Think and Just Thinking. He belonged to the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the Keswickian Christian denomination in which he was ordained as a minister. Multiple sources have . In February 2021 Miller & Martin, the law firm hired by RZIM to look into these allegations, confirmed their veracity. As a result, RZIM issued an apology and subsequently announced that it would undergo a name change and remove all material related to Zacharias. The Christian and Missionary Alliance posthumously revoked his ordination after conducting their own investigation. HarperCollins, which owns the Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson, also confirmed that it would take his books out of print and remove him from other published works." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ravi_Zacharias> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silvio_Rodríguez> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Silvio Rodríguez Domínguez (born 29 November 1946) is a Cuban musician, and leader of the Nueva Trova movement. He is widely considered Cuba's best folk singer and arguably one of Latin America's greatest singer-songwriters. Known for his intellectual, highly eloquent and symbolic lyrics, his songs are iconic elements of Latin American left-leaning popular culture. Many of his songs have become classics in Latin American music, such as \"Ojalá\", \"Playa Girón\", \"Unicornio\", \"Sueño con Serpientes\", \"Vamos a andar,\" and \"La maza\". Among his other well-known songs are political anthems like \"Fusil contra fusil\" and \"Canción del Elegido\", and poetic melodies like \"A donde van\" and \"Noche sin fin y mar\". He has released over 20 albums. Rodríguez, musically and politically, is a symbol of Latin American leftism. His lyrics are notably introspective, while his songs combine romanticism, eroticism, existentialism, revolutionary politics and idealism. As a humanist, his songs often bespeak a secular worldview, where humanity must make the best of this world." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silvio_Rodríguez> .

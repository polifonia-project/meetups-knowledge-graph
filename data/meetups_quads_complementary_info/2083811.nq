Notable for his involvement in the Melbourne gangland killings, Moran was shot dead in The Brunswick Club Hotel in Melbourne on 31 March 2004. His murder occurred one week after the funeral of fellow Melbourne underworld criminal and suspected hitman Andrew Veniamin. Moran, married to Judy Moran, was the father of murdered Melbourne underworld figure Jason Moran, murdered in 2003, and stepfather of Mark Moran, murdered in 2000. Moran was a long-term associate of Graham Kinniburgh after meeting as workers on Melbourne's waterside. Kinniburgh was earlier executed outside his Kew home on 13 December 2003. He was also the brother of underworld figure Desmond \"Tuppence\" Moran, who was shot dead on 15 June 2009, just outside a cafe on Union Road in Ascot Vale." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lewis_Moran> .

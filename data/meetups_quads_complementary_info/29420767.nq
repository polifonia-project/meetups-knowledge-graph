As a solo artist, he has released three records – Bookmarks, Sign Language and Road of Bones – and one EP, The Dylan EP (with Irish artist Gemma Hayes). Hart now releases albums with his band the Lonesome Fire, the first of which was the self-titled Roddy Hart & the Lonesome Fire produced by Danton Supple. Released in late 2013, the album was nominated for the Scottish Album of the Year Award in April 2014. Their second album - Swithering - was co-produced by Paul Savage (Mogwai, Emma Pollock, Admiral Fallow) and released in late 2016. The band made their American network TV debut on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on 17 February 2014 and proved so popular they were invited back the following week to perform a week long residency on the show. Hart has toured and played with numerous artists including Wilco, Field Music, KT Tunstall, Beth Orton, Ron Sexsmith, Dawes, the Low Anthem, LAU, Ray LaMontagne, Kris Kristofferson, Jeff Beck, Ray Davies, Jack Bruce, and others. He curates the Roaming Roots Revue for Celtic Connections each year and presents two weekly radio shows on BBC Radio Scotland: The Roddy Hart Show and The Quay Sessions. He was Associate Musical Director on the Scottish film Sunshine on Leith and with Tommy Reilly wrote the music and lyrics for the film Anna and the Apocalypse. The duo arranged the music and wrote the score for Our Ladies (released via Sony International), and are currently writing songs for Steven Spielberg's revival of Animaniacs for Warner Bros. and Hulu, for which they won a Daytime Emmy for Best Original Song for an Animation. Their first stage musical - an adaptation of Peter Mullan's Orphans - will tour theatres in spring 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roddy_Hart> .

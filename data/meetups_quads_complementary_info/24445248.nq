Originally from North Carolina, Wess moved to Italy in the 1960s in pursuit of a musical career. He formed a successful duo with Ghezzi and achieved some hits in Italy, such as \"Voglio stare con te\", \"Come stai? Con chi sei?\" and \"Un corpo e un'anima\". Wess also was a singer and played bass guitar for the soul-funk band Wess & The Airedales in the 1960s and early 1970s. He died in New York during his United States tour when a breathing crisis led to his death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wess> .

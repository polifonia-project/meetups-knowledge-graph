<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_DePoe> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter DePoe (born August 21, 1943), also known as Last Walking Bear, is an American rock musician who is perhaps best known as the drummer for the Native American band Redbone. Born in Neah Bay, Washington in 1943, his tribal Ancestors are Southern Cheyenne, Turtle Mountain Chippewa, and Rogue River/Siletz. DePoe is also of French and German descent. He first played with Jimi Hendrix in Seattle's local taverns as a young man and then moved to California and became Redbone's drummer in 1969. He was credited with developing a style of drumming known as \"King Kong\", later copied by other drummers for its versatile and funk-oriented rhythms. In early 1972, he left the group. The band replaced him with Arturo Perez, and then with Redbone bandmate Tony Bellamy's Filipino-Mexican American cousin, Butch Rillera." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_DePoe> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Duncan_(actor)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Duncan (December 16, 1879 â€“ February 7, 1961), born in Dundee, Scotland, was known as a major actor, producer, writer, and director of film serials and features in Hollywood. After immigrating to the United States as a child with his family, he became a leading star in the new film industry. Promoted as a Scottish star, he became one of the highest paid actors when under contract to Vitagraph. Duncan worked with major studios of the day, including the Selig Polyscope Company and Vitagraph. As was typical of many early films, especially the silents, most of his films have not survived to the present day." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Duncan_(actor)> .

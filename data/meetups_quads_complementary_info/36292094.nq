Known primarily for his electric rock-influenced guitar playing, he frequently played acoustic guitar on jazz fusion recordings in the 1970s. Since the late 1990s, he was best known as a key figure in the Czech blues and blues rock scene with his Luboš Andršt Blues Band, and shared the stage with a number of American blues musicians, including B.B. King. His father was Czech ice hockey player and executive Zdeněk Andršt. His cousin Petr Janda is also a guitarist, from the Czech beat band Olympic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luboš_Andršt> .

He started in the music business as a drummer who played with The Bel-Airs and took his experience to broader appeal with The Challengers, who were in the forefront of the surf music explosion in southern California. He also worked as a composer, arranger, music manager, producer, and music publisher. He owned the rights to several iconic surf and rock songs including \"Wipe Out\", \"Mr. Moto\" (written by him with Paul Johnson), and \"Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It)\". He is well known as being one of the first pioneers of surf music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Delvy> .

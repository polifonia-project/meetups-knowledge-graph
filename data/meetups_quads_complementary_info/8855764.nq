<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kurt_Gänzl> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kurt-Friedrich Gänzl (born 15 February 1946) is a New Zealand writer, historian and former casting director and singer best known for his books about musical theatre. After a decade-long playwriting, acting and singing career, and a second career as a casting director of West End shows, Gänzl became one of the world's most important chroniclers of musical theatre history. According to Christophe Mirambeau of Canal Académie, \"Kurt Gänzl is an institution. No one interested in musicals and operetta can ignore that. He is the world reference – with some few others, like Gerald Bordman, Ken Bloom, or Andrew Lamb – for that subject.\" He has written more than a dozen books on musical theatre topics, as well as blogs and articles about musicals, light opera and people, especially of the Victorian era, involved with the musical stage. He has also translated French poetry." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kurt_Gänzl> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sylvia_Juncosa> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sylvia Juncosa is an American punk and metal guitarist, singer, songwriter and keyboardist from Los Angeles. Noted primarily for her guitar work, during the 1980s she was among relatively few women with established aggressive rock guitar credibility. She released four solo albums and three albums with her band after starting her career as a keyboard player in The Leaving Trains. She was also a member of the band SWA with ex-Black Flag bass player Chuck Dukowski. She was active from 1980 to 1995 before taking a hiatus, then started playing guitar again in 2009." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sylvia_Juncosa> .

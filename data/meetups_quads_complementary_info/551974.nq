He became better known for his series of pop rock ballads, recorded after a stylistic change in the late 1980s. Bolton has sold more than 75 million records, and recorded eight top 10 albums and two number-one singles on the Billboard charts, as well as winning six American Music Awards and two Grammy Awards.

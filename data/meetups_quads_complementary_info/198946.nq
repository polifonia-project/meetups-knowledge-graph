As part of the songwriting team Kander and Ebb (with lyricist Fred Ebb), Kander wrote the scores for 15 musicals, including Cabaret (1966) and Chicago (1975), both of which were later adapted into acclaimed films. He and Ebb also wrote the standard \"New York, New York\" (also known as \"Theme from New York, New York\")." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Kander> .

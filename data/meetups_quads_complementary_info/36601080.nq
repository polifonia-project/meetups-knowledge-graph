<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Leighton> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Leighton (24 June 1921 â€“ 26 June 2009) was an American classical and jazz harmonica player who performed from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s. After a hiatus while he managed a recording studio, he performed again in the 1980s until his death. He performed as a soloist and as a member of international ensembles. He worked as a studio musician for radio, film, and television. In the 1950s, Leighton founded JAC Recording, a small recording studio in his apartment in Manhattan. Several years later, the studio hired record producer Phil Ramone, who was mentored by Leighton and other audio engineers. Ramone attributes his love of engineering to Leighton." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Leighton> .

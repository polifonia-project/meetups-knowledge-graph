Along with the journalist, editor and broadcaster Mark Ellen, he turned the pop magazine Smash Hits into one of the most popular UK music magazines of the 1980s. He co-presented the BBC broadcast of Live Aid on 13 July 1985, when he was the presenter told by Bob Geldof to \"fuck the address\" when pleading with viewers to send in their money." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Hepworth> .

He is a pioneer of Banku music, a fusion of sound he describes as a mixture of Ghanaian highlife and Nigerian chord progressions and patterns. Mr Eazi relocated to Kumasi, Ghana in 2008 and enrolled at KNUST, where he began booking artists to perform at college parties. He showed interest in music after recording a guest verse on \"My Life\", a song that gained traction and became a popular record at KNUST. Mr Eazi released his debut mixtape About to Blow in 2013. He gained an international audience following the release of the Efya-assisted single \"Skin Tight\". His second mixtape Life Is Eazi, Vol. 1 â€“ Accra To Lagos was released in 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mr_Eazi> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lindsay_McDougall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lindsay \"The Doctor\" McDougall (born 9 March 1978) is an Australian rock guitarist and radio presenter. Since 1996, he has been the lead guitarist in punk rock band, Frenzal Rhomb alongside lead singer Jay Whalley. He has co-written songs with fellow band members including their highest charting single, \"You Are Not My Friend\". During 2003 McDougall organised Rock Against Howard, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister, John Howard's government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election; Howard's coalition was nonetheless re-elected. In 2005, with Whalley, he co-hosted the Breakfast Show on national youth radio network Triple J, as Jay and the Doctor. In 2008, after Whalley left, he worked with Robbie Buck and Marieke Hardy. From 2010 to late 2014, he hosted the afternoon drive time programme. Since January 2018, McDougall has fronted the afternoon drive show on the ABC's local radio station in Wollongong, 97.3 ABC Illawarra. He is an animal rights activist and a vegan." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lindsay_McDougall> .

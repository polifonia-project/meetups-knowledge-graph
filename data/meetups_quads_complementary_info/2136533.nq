Widely known for his role as Mick Holland in Channel Ten's TV series Offspring in which he performs his own music, he has recorded solo albums and written and performed numerous cabaret shows, including Songs from the Middle with the Brodsky Quartet. His biographical musical comedy Shane Warne: The Musical won the 2009 Helpmann Award for Best New Australian Work, a Victorian Premier's Literary Award and a Green Room Award. Following his songwriting career on Broadway, where he composed Beetlejuice and King Kong, Perfect returned to Australia where he was to star as Franklin Hart Jr. in Dolly Parton's musical 9 to 5 in late 2020, although it was subsequently indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddie_Perfect> .

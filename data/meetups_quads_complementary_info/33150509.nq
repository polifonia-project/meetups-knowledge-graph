Before his solo act, he was a lead singer in various bands, most notably Grupo Tradição. His biggest national and international hit \"Ai Se Eu Te Pego\" reached number one in most European and Latin American charts. Teló's artistic career began in 1987 when he made his first solo performance in his school choir, singing a piece by Roberto Carlos and Erasmo Carlos. At ten, his father gave him an accordion. At age 12, upon encouragement by neighbors, school friends, and his brothers, he formed a band, \"Guri,\" which played traditional music. He was the band's lead singer and composer. Besides his love for the harmonica, Teló also took piano lessons for five years. He was also a dancer and played the accordion, harmonica, and guitar." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_Teló> .

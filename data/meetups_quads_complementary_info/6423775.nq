Smith played with five different MLB teams but is most notable for his integral role during the 1960 World Series as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates. During his playing career, he threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet (1.83 m) tall, and weighed 195 pounds (88 kg)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hal_W._Smith> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stomp_Gordon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Archie A. Gordon, known professionally as Stomp Gordon (February 10, 1926 â€“ January 18, 1958), was an American jump blues pianist and singer in the 1950s. He led a five piece ensemble, which was known for their riotous live performances and released eight singles in the decade, including an uproarious skit on the then recent Kinsey Reports on \"What's Her Whimsey, Dr Kinsey\". However his rather brief recording career finished in his 30th year, and Gordon died in January 1958, aged 31." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stomp_Gordon> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randy_Rhoads> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Randall William Rhoads (December 6, 1956 â€“ March 19, 1982) was an American guitarist. He was the co-founder and original guitarist of the heavy metal band Quiet Riot, and the guitarist and co-songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne's first two solo albums Blizzard of Ozz (1980) and Diary of a Madman (1981). Rhoads was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021. Originally educated in classical guitar, Rhoads combined these early influences with heavy metal, helping to form a subgenre later known as neoclassical metal. With Quiet Riot, he adopted a black-and-white polka-dot theme which became an emblem for the group. He reached his peak as the guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne's solo career, performing on tracks including \"Crazy Train\" and \"Mr. Crowley\" on the Blizzard of Ozz album. \"Crazy Train\" features one of the most well-known heavy metal guitar riffs. He died in a plane crash while on tour with Osbourne in Florida in 1982. Despite his short career, Rhoads is regarded as a pivotal figure in metal music, credited with pioneering a fast and technical style of guitar soloing that largely defined the metal scene of the 1980s. He helped to popularize various guitar techniques now common in heavy metal music, including two-handed tapping, tremolo bar dive bombs, and intricate scale patterns, drawing comparisons to his contemporary, Eddie Van Halen. The Jackson Rhoads model guitar was originally commissioned by him. He has been included in several published \"Greatest Guitarist\" lists, and has been cited by other prominent guitarists as a major influence." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randy_Rhoads> .

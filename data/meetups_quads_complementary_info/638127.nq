<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Rhodes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Allen Rhodes (September 13, 1909 â€“ March 4, 2001) was an American Republican politician who served as Governor of Ohio from 1963 to 1971 and again from 1975 to 1983. As of 2022, Rhodes was one of only seven U.S. governors to serve four four-year terms in office. Rhodes is tied for the fourth longest gubernatorial tenure in post-Constitutional U.S. history at 5,840 days. He also served as Mayor of Columbus from 1944 to 1952 and Ohio State Auditor from 1953 to 1963. On May 3, 1970, Rhodes sent National Guard troops onto the Kent State University campus at the request of Kent, Ohio mayor LeRoy Satrom after the ROTC building was burned down by unknown arsonists the previous night. On May 4, Guardsmen killed four students and wounded nine others." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Rhodes> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Crocker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "General Sir John Tredinnick Crocker, GCB, KBE, DSO, MC (4 January 1896 â€“ 9 March 1963) was a senior British Army officer who fought in both world wars. He served as both a private soldier and a junior officer in the First World War, and as a distinguished brigade, division and corps commander during the Second World War, where his most notable role was as General Officer Commanding (GOC) of I Corps during the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944, leading the corps throughout the subsequent campaign in Western Europe until Victory in Europe Day (VE-Day) just over eleven months later. After the war was over Crocker became Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of Middle East Land Forces and Adjutant-General to the Forces, the second most senior officer on the Army Council. An outstanding soldier, Crocker was highly regarded by both his superiors, most notably Field Marshal The Viscount Alanbrooke, and his subordinates, including the future Field Marshal Lord Carver, but he remains relatively unknown." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Crocker> .

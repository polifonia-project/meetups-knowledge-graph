As a child, Olwik was immersed in music and is classically trained to play the viola, piano, drums and guitar. In an interview with music blog We Got This Covered, he stated that he became interested in producing electronic music when he was first introduced to a track called “Mellow” by Swedish duo Nause. In the same interview, he also stated that he \"got inspired to create my own melodies later when I discovered Swedish producer Steerner, who was just starting to grow at the time.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olwik> .

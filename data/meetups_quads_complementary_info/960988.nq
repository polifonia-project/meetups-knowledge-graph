<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Cooper> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Hayes Shofner Cooper (born June 19, 1954) is an American lawyer, businessman, professor, and politician who has served since 2003 as the U.S. representative for Tennessee's 5th congressional district (based in Nashville and containing parts of Davidson, Cheatham, and Dickson Counties). He is a member of the Democratic Party and the Blue Dog Coalition, and represented Tennessee's 4th congressional district from 1983 to 1995. His district includes all of Nashville. He chairs the United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the House Armed Services Committee, and sits on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, United States House Committee on the Budget, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, more committees than any other member of Congress. He is also the dean of Tennessee's congressional delegation. He is the third-longest serving member of Congress ever from Tennessee, after Jimmy Quillen and B. Carroll Reece. Due to Cooper's rare split tenure in Congress in two entirely different districts, his career was divided in two fields: regulatory and health care legislation in the rural 4th district and military affairs in the urban 5th. Cooper built seniority and respect on two different sets of committees, becoming what The New York Times op-ed writer Joe Nocera called \"the conscience of the House, a lonely voice for civility in this ugly era.\" Cooper announced that he would not seek reelection in 2022 due to partisan gerrymandering in Tennessee's post-2020 Census redistricting cycle that effectively eliminated his Democratic-leaning district to create another Republican seat." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Cooper> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacki-O> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Angela Brookins-Gillispie (born November 24, 1971), better known as Jacki-O, is an American rapper who is now signed to her own label Virtuous Woman Entertainment. Born in Florida, she got her first break in 2003 with the sex rap \"P (Real Good)\", best known under its clean name \"Nookie\", which garnered the MC comparisons to fellow Southern rapper Trina. Although it was the first time that many had heard of Jacki-O, she kept a high profile, prior to her radio and club successes, with several appearances on Miami-area mixtapes. The success of \"Nookie\" led Jacki-O to discuss a similar subject matter on her second single, \"Sugar Walls,\" released in 2004 in anticipation of her debut album, Poe Little Rich Girl Throughout her career, Jacki-O had worked with a variety of producers and rappers such as Timbaland, Busta Rhymes, Ghostface Killah, Ying Yang Twins and DJ Khaled. In 2014, Jacki-O reported her retirement in rap from her Facebook account saying, \"she was getting closer to God and he is changing her life around\". She is married and an ordained minister." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacki-O> .

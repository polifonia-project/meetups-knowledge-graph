His professional music career began in the late-night television sketch comedy Saturday Night Live as its house band's lead guitarist in 1997 and producing remixes for artists such as Bon Jovi and Gravediggaz. He came into music prominence in 2004 for producing Kelly Clarkson's single \"Since U Been Gone\" with Swedish record producer Max Martin. Gottwald continued to co-write and produce commercially successful records such as \"Who Knew\" (2006) for Pink, \"Girlfriend\" (2007) for Avril Lavigne, and \"I Kissed a Girl\" (2008) for Katy Perry, before leaving Saturday Night Live and reuniting with Clarkson for \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" (2009). As the founder of Kemosabe Records, Gottwald has signed artists such as Kesha, Doja Cat, Juicy J, R. City, Lil Bibby, and Elliphant. Gottwald's work has been recognized with various music industry awards. Billboard named him one of the top performing producers of the 2000s. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers awarded him Producer and Songwriter of the Year honors from 2009 to 2011. At the 53rd Grammy Awards, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, and Perry's Teenage Dream was nominated for Album of the Year. In October 2014, Kesha initiated a series of lawsuits, alleging sexual assault and abuse by Gottwald." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dr._Luke> .

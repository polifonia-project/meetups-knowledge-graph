Alongside Nazariy Yaremchuk, Sofia Rotaru and Volodymyr Ivasyuk, Zinkevych was one of the faces of the Ukrainian roots revival music of the 1970s. Zinkevych found his initial fame as the lead singer of the Ukrainian VIA and as the lead actor in the 1970 film Chervona Ruta. His interpretations of Volodymyr Ivasyuk's songs \"Chervona ruta\", \"Mila moya\" and \"Na shvidkih poïzdah\" made him known all over the Soviet Union. He was appointed a People's Artist of Ukraine in 1995, received the Ukrainian State Prize in 1994 and became a Hero of Ukraine in 2009. Several of Zinkevych songs, as well as some of his dance choreographies, made it to the \"Golden Fund of Ukrainian artistry\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vasyl_Zinkevych> .

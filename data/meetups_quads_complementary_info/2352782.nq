<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Bishop_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Henry Rowley Bishop (18 November 1787 – 30 April 1855) was an English composer. He is most famous for the songs \"Home! Sweet Home!\" and \"Lo! Here the Gentle Lark.\" He was the composer or arranger of some 120 dramatic works, including 80 operas, light operas, cantatas, and ballets. Bishop was Knighted in 1842. Bishop worked for all the major theatres of London in his era – including the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Vauxhall Gardens and the Haymarket Theatre, and was Professor of Music at the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford. His second wife was the noted soprano Anna Bishop, who scandalised British society by leaving him and conducting an open liaison with the harpist Nicolas-Charles Bochsa until the latter's death in Sydney." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Bishop_(composer)> .

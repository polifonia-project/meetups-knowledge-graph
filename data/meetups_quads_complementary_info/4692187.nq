<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Downey_(drummer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brian Michael Downey (born 27 January 1951) is an Irish drummer. He was a founding member of the rock band Thin Lizzy and the only other constant in the band aside from leader Phil Lynott until their disbandment in 1983. Downey also co-wrote several Thin Lizzy songs. Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia has argued that Downey is \"certainly one of the most underrated [rock drummers] of his generation\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Downey_(drummer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonny_Okosun> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sonny Okosun (1 January 1947 â€“ 24 May 2008) was a Nigerian musician, who was known as the leader of the Ozzidi band. He named his band Ozzidi after a renowned Ijaw river god, but to Okosun the meaning was \"there is a message\". His surname is sometimes spelled Okosuns and his first name Sunny. He was one of the leading Nigerian musicians from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Okosun's brand of African pop music, Ozzidi, is a synthesis of Afro-beat, reggae and funk music. From 1977, he became known for protest songs about Pan-Africanism, freedom and a few other social and political issues affecting Africans." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonny_Okosun> .

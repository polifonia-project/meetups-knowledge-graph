<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Hale_Thompson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Hale Thompson (May 14, 1869 â€“ March 19, 1944) was an American politician who served as mayor of Chicago from 1915 to 1923 and again from 1927 to 1931. Known as \"Big Bill\", he is the most recent Republican to have served as mayor of Chicago. Historians rank him among the most unethical mayors in American history, mainly for his open alliance with Al Capone. However, others recognize the effectiveness of his political methods and publicity-oriented campaigning, acknowledging him as a \"Political Chameleon\" and an effective political machine. Time magazine said in 1931, \"chief credit for creating 20th Century Politics Chicago Style\" should go to William Thompson. Thompson was known for his over-the-top campaigning and uncensored language that, along with his towering height and weight, earned him the nickname \"Big Bill\". Upon his reelection in 1919, Thompson had the school board suspend the Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools, William McAndrew. He was also at the forefront of the movement for the Chicago Public Library system and education officials to censor and ban many texts and historical recollections coming from the United Kingdom. Though Thompson was a popular figure, his popularity collapsed after his death, when two safe-deposit boxes were found in his name containing over $1.8 million ($28.3 million today) in cash and bonds." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Hale_Thompson> .

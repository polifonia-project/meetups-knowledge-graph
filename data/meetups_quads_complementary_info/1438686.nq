<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Diffie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joe Logan Diffie (December 28, 1958 â€“ March 29, 2020) was an American country music singer and songwriter. After working as a demo singer in the mid 1980s, he signed with Epic Records' Nashville division in 1990. Between then and 2004, Diffie charted 35 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, five of which peaked at number one: his debut release \"Home\", \"If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)\", \"Third Rock from the Sun\", \"Pickup Man\" (his longest-lasting number-one song, at four weeks) and \"Bigger Than the Beatles\". In addition to these singles, he had 12 others reach the top 10 and ten more reach the top 40 on the same chart. He also co-wrote singles for Holly Dunn, Tim McGraw, and Jo Dee Messina, and recorded with Mary Chapin Carpenter, George Jones, and Marty Stuart. Diffie released seven studio albums, a Christmas album, and a greatest-hits package under the Epic label. He also released one studio album each through Monument Records, Broken Bow Records, and Rounder Records. Among his albums, 1993's Honky Tonk Attitude and 1994's Third Rock from the Sun are certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, while 1992's Regular Joe and 1995's Life's So Funny are both certified gold. His album, Homecoming: The Bluegrass Album, was released in late 2010 through Rounder. His style is defined by a neotraditionalist country influence with a mix of novelty songs and ballads. Diffie died from complications related to COVID-19 during the pandemic on March 29, 2020, at the age of 61." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Diffie> .

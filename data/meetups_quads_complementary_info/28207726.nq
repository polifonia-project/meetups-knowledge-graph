<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jay_Ilagan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Julius Abad Ilagan (January 20, 1955 â€“ February 4, 1992) was a Filipino actor. He hosted Stop, Look and Listen and starred in My Son, My Son and Goin' Bananas, and starred and participated in a number of movies. Born Julius Abad Ilagan on January 20, 1955, his good looks eventually made him a matinee idol, starring in the films Maruja (1967), Tubog Sa Ginto (1970), Pinoy Crazy Boys (1974), and Hinog Sa Pilit. And because the looks came with deep talent, Jay survived the transition from teen star to adult actor - winning a Gawad Urian Best Supporting Actor trophy in 1982 for the movie, Kisapmata, another Gawad Urian Best Actor in 1985 for his role in Sister Stella L., and 1988 FAMAS and Film Academy of the Philippines Best Actor for his acting in Maging Akin Ka Lamang. His acting range was versatile as he has also appeared in a number of comedy movies and TV shows alongside critically-acclaimed dramatic films." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jay_Ilagan> .

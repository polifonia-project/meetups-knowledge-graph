<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_X_of_France> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Louis X (4 October 1289 – 5 June 1316), known as the Quarrelsome (French: le Hutin), was King of France from 1314 and King of Navarre as Louis I from 1305 until his death. He emancipated serfs who could buy their freedom and readmitted Jews into the kingdom. His short reign in France was marked by tensions with the nobility, due to fiscal and centralisation reforms initiated during the reign of his father by Grand Chamberlain Enguerrand de Marigny. Louis' first wife, Margaret, implicated in the Tour de Nesle affair, was found guilty of infidelity and was imprisoned til her death in 14 August 1315. Louis and Clementia of Hungary were married that same year, but he died on 5 June 1316 leaving a pregnant wife. Queen Clementia gave birth to a boy, who was proclaimed king as John I, but the infant only lived five days. Louis' brother Philip, Count of Poitiers, succeeded John to become, Philip V, King of France." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_X_of_France> .

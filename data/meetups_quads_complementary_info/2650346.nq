Soyer was referred to as an American scene painter. He is identified as a Social Realist because of his interest in men and women viewed in contemporary settings which included the streets, subways, salons and artists' studios of New York City. He also wrote several books on his life and art. His brothers Moses Soyer and Isaac Soyer were also painters." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raphael_Soyer> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Bruckheimer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jerome Leon Bruckheimer (born September 21, 1943) is an American film and television producer. He has been active in the genres of action, drama, fantasy, and science fiction. His films include Flashdance, Top Gun, The Rock, Crimson Tide, Con Air, Armageddon, Enemy of the State, Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor, Kangaroo Jack, and the Beverly Hills Cop, Bad Boys, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the National Treasure franchises. Many of his films have been co-produced by Paramount and Disney, while many of his television series have been co-produced by Warner Bros. and CBS Studios. In July 2003, Bruckheimer was honored by Variety as the first producer in Hollywood history to produce the top two highest-grossing films of a single weekend, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and Bad Boys II. His best known television series are CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, CSI: Cyber, Without a Trace, Cold Case, and the American version of The Amazing Race. At one point, three of his TV series ranked among the top 10 in the U.S. ratingsâ€”a unique feat in television. He is also the co-founder and co-majority owner (along with David Bonderman) of the Seattle Kraken, the 2021 expansion team of the National Hockey League." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Bruckheimer> .

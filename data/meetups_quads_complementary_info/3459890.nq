<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wolf_Hoffmann> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wolf Hoffmann (born 10 December 1959) is a German musician, primarily known as the guitarist and last remaining original member of heavy metal band Accept since 1976. His work in Accept influenced the development of speed metal genre. He is also one of the first players of neoclassical metal. Hoffmann has played in all Accept's line-ups since 1976. The band was inactive between 1997 and 2008 except some live performances in 2005. The band was reformed by Hoffmann and another original member Peter Baltes in 2009 after they met the singer Mark Tornillo. Their comeback album, Blood of the Nations, was released on 20 August 2010 to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Four follow-up albums were released successively since then. Baltes left Accept in 2018 and Hoffmann is now the last original member. Hoffmann has released two neoclassical solo albums, Classical (1997) and Headbangers Symphony (2016)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wolf_Hoffmann> .

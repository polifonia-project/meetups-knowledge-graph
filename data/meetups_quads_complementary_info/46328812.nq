Banks started the Messengers in 1972 after he left The Jackson Southernaires. While with the Jackson Southernaires, Banks made his first big hit in 1964 on Peacock Records with the song \"Too Late\". His first song with The Messengers in 1972 was \"Heaven Must Be A Beautiful Place\", also on Peacock Records. A String of \"Chittlin Circuit\" hits was released on HSE Records. His first major hit was \"Things I Can't Change\" in 1974. Another hit came in 1975 with \"God’s Goodness\". His super hit was \"For The Wrong I've Done\" for which he was nominated for a Grammy in 1980. Perhaps Banks’ most memorable song, \"God Is Still In Charge\" came in 1982 off of an album of the same name. Banks stayed with HSE Records until they changed their name to Black Label. Three projects were released on this label. Willie Banks moved over to Malaco Records in the mid-1980s. He penned \"Look at the Blessings\" in 1986 with Malaco. He would release thirteen albums, five of them placing on the Billboard magazine Top Gospel Albums chart: For The Wrong I Done (1978), Mother Why (1980), \"Masterpiece\" (1989), The Legend Lives On (1992) and 1993's The Best of Willie Banks, which was released posthumously." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Banks_(musician)> .

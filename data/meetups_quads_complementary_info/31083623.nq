<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nathan_Phelps> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nathan Phelps (born November 22, 1958) is an American-born Canadian author, LGBT rights activist, and public speaker on the topics of religion and child abuse. He is the sixth-born of the 13 children of Fred Phelps, from whom he – along with three of his siblings – had been estranged since his 18th birthday in 1976 until his father's death in 2014. Phelps permanently left Westboro Baptist Church in 1980 and has since publicly censured the group." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nathan_Phelps> .

He recorded for Hickory Records in the 1970s, releasing three albums and charting 21 singles on Hot Country Songs. His highest chart entry was \"Unexpected Goodbye\", which reached number 23. One of his final brushes with the charts occurred in 1979 with \"Everyone Wants to Disco\". In discovering that 'they' did not, he changed career and pursued other avenues such as painting and screenwriting. Glenn Barber died in Gallatin, Tennessee, in March 2008, at the age of 73." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Barber> .

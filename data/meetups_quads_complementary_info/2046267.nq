He is known for his finger playing style and jazz-like bass parts, which can be heard on Testament songs such as \"Souls of Black\" and \"Disciples of the Watch\", although he has also occasionally been seen using a guitar pick. Christian also performed backing vocals in Testament." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greg_Christian> .

One of the last official vocalists of Agustín Lara, she became famous in the 1950s as a soloist on radio and television programs, and recorded exclusively for Musart Records and later for RCA Records. In movies, she had starring roles in A sablazo limpio (1958), Viva la parranda (1960), Las hijas del Amapolo (1962), and Escuela para solteras (1965). With her husband, singer Rafael Vázquez, she formed a duet named Carmela y Rafael, \"The Romantic Couple of Mexico\", which was hugely successful in the 1960s and 1970s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carmela_Rey> .

Mosca was born in Mount Vernon, New York, United States, to Italian American parents. He worked in cool jazz and post-bop. After playing in the United States Army Band during World War II, he studied at the New York College of Music using funds provided by the G.I. Bill. He began working with Lee Konitz in 1949, and also worked with Warne Marsh. He spent much of his career teaching and was relatively inactive after 1992, but new CDs were released in 2004, 2005, and 2008. He died from emphysema in White Plains, New York, at the age of 80." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sal_Mosca> .

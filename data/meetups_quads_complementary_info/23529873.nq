He currently resides in Brooklyn, New York. David Stith comes from a musical family: his father was a college wind ensemble director and former church choir director; his grandfather is professor emeritus in the music department at Cornell University; his mother is a pianist; and his sisters sing opera and play piano and percussion. Stith began working on an MFA in graphic design at Indiana University's Henry Radford Hope School of Fine Art in 2008, although he did not complete it. Stith produced the artwork for his Heavy Ghost CD and other projects for Asthmatic Kitty, including cover art for Dead Zone Boys by Jookabox, A Thousand Shark's Teeth and All Things Will Unwind by My Brightest Diamond, Animal Feelings by Rafter, Penelope and Unremembered by Sarah Kirkland Snider, as well as the Library Catalog Music Series." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/DM_Stith> .

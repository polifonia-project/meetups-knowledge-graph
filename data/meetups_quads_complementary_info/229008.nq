<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eloy_Alfaro> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "José Eloy Alfaro Delgado (25 June 1842 – 28 January 1912) often referred to as \"The Old Warrior,\" was an Ecuadorian politician who served as the President of Ecuador from 1895 to 1901 and from 1906 to 1911. Eloy Alfaro emerged as the leader of the Liberal Party and became a driving force protect fairness, justice and liberty. He became one of the strongest opponents of the pro-Catholic conservative President Gabriel García Moreno (1821–1875). The \"Viejo Luchador\" (in Spanish) played a central role in the Liberal Revolution of 1895 and fought against conservatism for almost 30 years. Alfaro's major political legacies are considered to be strengthened national unity, securing the integrity of Ecuador's borders, and the increased secularization of the country. Alfaro led the modernization of Ecuadorian society through the introduction of new ideas, education, and systems of public transport and communication, including the engineering feat of the Transandino Railway linking Guayaquil with Quito. Alfaro's effigy appeared on the Ecuadorian 50-cent coin from the 2000 issue, and the Ecuadorian Army's military college bears his name, as have two ships of the Ecuadorian Navy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eloy_Alfaro> .

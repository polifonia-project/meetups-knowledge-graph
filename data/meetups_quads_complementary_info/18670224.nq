He is the founder of FYF_Fest and the \"F Yeah Fest\" music tour. The first Fuck Yeah Fest was held in 2004 at the Echo, a club in Echo Park, Los Angeles, California.As of 2009, the festival officially changed its name to \"FYF Fest\" after moving the festival from the Echoplex to the L.A.

Spin magazine reported that Sean's sexual misconduct was considered an \"open secret\" within the L.A. music scene.

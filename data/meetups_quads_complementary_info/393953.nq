<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roscoe_Mitchell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roscoe Mitchell (born August 3, 1940) is an American composer, jazz instrumentalist, and educator, known for being \"a technically superb – if idiosyncratic – saxophonist\". The Penguin Guide to Jazz described him as \"one of the key figures\" in avant-garde jazz; All About Jazz stated in 2004 that he had been \"at the forefront of modern music\" for more than 35 years. Critic Jon Pareles in The New York Times has mentioned that Mitchell \"qualifies as an iconoclast\". In addition to his own work as a bandleader, Mitchell is known for cofounding the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roscoe_Mitchell> .

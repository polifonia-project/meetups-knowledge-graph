<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Ann_Parker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Cynthia Ann Parker (October 28, 1827 â€“ March 1871), also known as Naduah (Comanche: Narua), was a white woman who was notable for having been captured during the Fort Parker massacre at about age nine, by a Comanche war band and adopted into the tribe. Twenty-four years later she was discovered and taken captive by Texas Rangers, at approximately age 33, and unwillingly taken back to European-American society. Her Comanche name means \"someone found\" in English. Thoroughly assimilated as Comanche, Parker had married Peta Nocona, a chief. They had three children together, including son Quanah Parker, who became the last free Comanche chief. Parker was captured by the Texas Rangers during the Battle of Pease River, also known as the \"Pease River Massacre\". During this raid, the Rangers killed an estimated six to twelve people, mostly women and children. Parker was taken against her will back to her extended biological family. For the remaining 10 years of her life, she mourned for her Comanche family, and refused to adjust to white society. She escaped at least once but was recaptured and brought back. Unable to grasp how thoroughly she identified with the Comanche, the European-American settlers believed that she had been saved or redeemed by being returned to their society. Heartbroken over her daughter's death from influenza and pneumonia, Parker died within years. She died in 1871. Although initially buried in Anderson County, Texas, her remains were moved twice after her death. In 1910 her son Quanah had her moved to Post Oak Mission Cemetery, Comanche County, Oklahoma; and in 1957 the mother and son were both reinterred in in Oklahoma. In 1965 the state of Texas arranged for her daughter's remains to be moved from Texas and reinterred next to the mother and son." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Ann_Parker> .

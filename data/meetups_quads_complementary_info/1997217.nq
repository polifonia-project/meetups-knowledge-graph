<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Louis_Walker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joe Louis Walker, also known as JLW (born December 25, 1949) is an American musician, best known as an electric blues guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. His knowledge of blues history is revealed by his use of older material and playing styles. NPR Music described him as \"Powerful, soul-stirring, fierce and gritty...a legendary boundary-pushing icon of modern blues.\" Another music journalist noted \"If you define 'blues' by the rigid categories of structure rather than the flexible language of feeling allusion, Robert Cray... Larry Garner, Joe Louis Walker and James Armstrong are a new and uncategorizable breed, their music blues-like rather than blues, each of them blending ideas and devices from a variety of sources – soul, rock, jazz, gospel – with a sophistication beyond the reach of their forerunners\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Louis_Walker> .

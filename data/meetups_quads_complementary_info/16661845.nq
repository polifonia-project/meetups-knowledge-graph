<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shin_Jeong-ah> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shin Jeong-ah (born 28 April 1972) is a South Korean woman who lied about her academic background to become an assistant art professor at Dongguk University and chief curator at Sungkok Art Museum. She created an international scandal shortly after her appointment in July 2007 as joint artistic director of the 2008 Gwangju Biennale, when she was found to have fabricated her academic credentials that she had graduated from the University of Kansas and Yale University. Shin was sentenced to 18 months in prison, and Dongguk University unsuccessfully sued Yale University in U.S. court for at least $50 million in damages." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shin_Jeong-ah> .

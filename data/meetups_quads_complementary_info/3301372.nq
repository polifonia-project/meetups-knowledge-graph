<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorothy_Squires> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dorothy Squires (born Edna May Squires, 25 March 1915 â€“ 14 April 1998) was a Welsh singer. Her early successes were achieved with \"The Gypsy\", \"A Tree in the Meadow\" and \"I'm Walking Behind You\" by her partner Billy Reid, and \"\" written by Squires with piano accompaniment by Russ Conway. Among her later well-known recordings were versions of \"Till\", \"My Way\", and \"For Once in My Life\". Other notable cover songs included \"A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening\", \"I'm in the Mood for Love\", \"Anytime\", \"If You Love Me (Really Love Me)\" and \"And So to Sleep Again\". In later life, Squires filed multiple frivolous lawsuits. She was banned from the High Court by 1982, and formally declared a \"vexatious litigant\" from 1987, requiring the court's permission to file any further cases. The legal expenses ultimately led to her bankruptcy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorothy_Squires> .

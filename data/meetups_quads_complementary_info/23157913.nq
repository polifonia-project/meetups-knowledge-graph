On June 8, 2009, Oakes announced that he was leaving the band to pursue a career as a restaurateur. He is now a part owner of Boca Fiesta, a restaurant located in Gainesville, Florida that focuses on the fusion of southern and Mexican cuisine, as well as a venue space, The Backyard, that houses music shows, dance nights, and many more events. Oakes is also well known for popularizing the freeganism movement, with the publication of his zine, Why Freegan? Oakes formed the band Sunshine State along with Troy Perlman, Mike Magarelli and Kyle Flick in 2013. With the release of their first album Pour in 2014, Oakes gave an interview with Punk News where he spoke about the changes to a new career, new band, and their upcoming performances. On March 5, 2022 SPIN magazine wrote an article to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Against Me! album Reinventing Axl Rose... or as the author said: \"It’s the transformative folk-punk album’s 20th birthday.\" Oakes responded to the magazine's publication by saying: \"Had a nice little trip down memory lane doing an interview for, and reading, this incredibly in-depth oral history of a very fun time in my life. Happy 20th Axl, I’ll buy you your very first pint of Guinness for your 21st next year!\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warren_Oakes> .

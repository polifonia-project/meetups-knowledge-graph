<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koda_Kumi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kumiko Kōda (神田 來未子, Kōda Kumiko, born November 13, 1982), known professionally as Koda Kumi (倖田 來未, Kōda Kumi), is a Japanese singer from Kyoto, known for her urban and R&B songs. After debuting with the single \"Take Back\" in December 2000, Koda gained fame in March 2003 when the songs from her seventh single, \"Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba\", were used as themes for the video game Final Fantasy X-2. Her popularity grew with the release of her fourth studio album Secret (2005), her sixteenth single \"Butterfly\" (2005), and her first greatest hits album Best: First Things (2005), reaching the number-three, number-two, and number-one spots respectively. Though her early releases presented a conservative, quiet image, she has become a fashion leader among young women, setting trends such as the ero-kakkoii style. In 2006 and 2007, Oricon named Koda as the top selling artist of the year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koda_Kumi> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douglas_September> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Douglas September, (born September 25, 1972, in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia) is a Canadian musician. He is known for his poetic lyrics, as well as his innovative musical style that blends folk and blues with a caustic modern commentary. As a composer, musician, producer and engineer, September's passion for arranging music from the ordinary every day into a unique auditory experience has evolved into a singular style. His music has been likened to Bob Dylan, Tim Buckley, and Tom Waits." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douglas_September> .

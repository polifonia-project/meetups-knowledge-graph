<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Coxon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Graham Leslie Coxon (born 12 March 1969) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and painter who came to prominence as a founding member of the rock band Blur. As the group's lead guitarist and secondary vocalist, Coxon is featured on all eight of Blur's studio albums (although 2003's Think Tank only features his playing on one track, due to his temporary departure from the band during recording sessions for the album). He has also led a solo career since 1998, which all of his solo albums were produced and all the instruments played by himself. As well as being a musician, Coxon is a visual artist: he designed the cover art for all his solo albums as well as Blur's 13 (1999). Coxon plays several instruments and records his albums with little assistance from session musicians. Q magazine critic Adrian Deevoy has written: \"Coxon is an astonishing musician. His restless playing style – all chord slides, rapid pulloffs, mini-arpeggios and fractured runs – seems to owe more to his saxophone training than any conventional guitar tuition.\" An innovative lead guitarist, he has been described by Oasis bandmember Noel Gallagher as \"one of the most talented guitarists of his generation.\" Coxon was voted the 15th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years in a 2010 BBC poll." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Coxon> .

He is known for the song \"Be Faithful\", which topped the charts in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in October 2003, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Denmark and Australia. The song had been a favorite in clubs around the world for years but it took two years to clear the samples from Jay-Z, Black Sheep, Queen Pen, The Beatnuts and Faith Evans. He has also collaborated with numerous artists, such as Lil Jon, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Pitbull and Skrillex, among others." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fatman_Scoop> .

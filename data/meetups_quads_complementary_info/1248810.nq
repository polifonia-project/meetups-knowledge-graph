<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martyn_Bennett> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Martyn Bennett (17 February 1971 â€“ 30 January 2005) was a Canadian-Scottish musician who was influential in the evolution of modern Celtic fusion, a blending of traditional Celtic and modern music. He was a piper, violinist, composer and producer. He was an innovator and his compositions crossed musical and cultural divides. Sporting dreadlocks at the height of his performing career, his energetic displays led to descriptions such as \"the techno piper\". Diagnosis of serious illness at the age of thirty curtailed his live performances, although he completed a further two albums in the studio. He died fifteen months after release of his fifth album Grit." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martyn_Bennett> .

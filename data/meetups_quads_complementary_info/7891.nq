<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Lynch> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, visual artist, actor, musician, writer, and philanthropist. A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, Lynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and the César Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. In 2007, a panel of critics convened by The Guardian announced that \"after all the discussion, no one could fault the conclusion that David Lynch is the most important film-maker of the current era\", while AllMovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\". His work led to him being labeled \"the first populist surrealist\" by film critic Pauline Kael. Lynch studied painting before he began making short films in the late 1960s. His first feature-length film, the surrealist Eraserhead (1977), became a success on the midnight movie circuit, and he followed that by directing The Elephant Man (1980), Dune (1984), and Blue Velvet (1986). Lynch next created his own television series with Mark Frost, the murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990–91), which initially ran for two seasons. He also made the film prequel Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) and the road film Wild at Heart (1990) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001), and Inland Empire (2006). Lynch and Frost reunited in 2017 for the third season of Twin Peaks, which aired on Showtime. Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode, and reprised his onscreen role as Gordon Cole. Lynch's other artistic endeavors include his work as a musician, encompassing the studio albums BlueBOB (2001), Crazy Clown Time (2011), and The Big Dream (2013), as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films (sometimes alongside collaborators Alan Splet, Dean Hurley, and/or Angelo Badalamenti); painting and photography; writing the books Images (1994), Catching the Big Fish (2006), Room to Dream (2018), and numerous other literary works; and directing several music videos (such as the video for \"Shot in the Back of the Head\" by Moby, who, in turn, directed a video for Lynch's \"The Big Dream\") as well as advertisements, including the Dior promotional film Lady Blue Shanghai (2010). An avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM), in 2005 he founded the David Lynch Foundation, which seeks to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans, and refugees." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Lynch> .

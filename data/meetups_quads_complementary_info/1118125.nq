<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randy_Crawford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Veronica \"Randy\" Crawford (born February 18, 1952) is an American jazz and R&B singer. She has been more successful in Europe than in the United States, where she has not entered the Billboard Hot 100 as a solo artist. However, she has appeared on the Hot 100 singles chart twice. The first time was in 1979 as a guest vocalist on The Crusaders' top-40 hit \"Street Life\". She also dueted with Rick Springfield on the song \"Taxi Dancing\", which hit number 59 as the B-side of Springfield's hit \"Bop Til You Drop\". She has had five top-20 hits in the UK, including her 1980 number-two hit, \"One Day I'll Fly Away\", as well as six UK top-10 albums. Despite her American nationality, she won Best British Female Solo Artist in recognition of her popularity in the UK at the 1982 Brit Awards. In the late 2000s, she received her first two Grammy Award nominations." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randy_Crawford> .

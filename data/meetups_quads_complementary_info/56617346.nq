<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Rhodes_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "George Arthur Rhodes (October 10, 1918 â€“ December 25, 1985) was an American arranger, conductor, music director, pianist, and composer. He is most known for being Sammy Davis Jr.'s long-time music director, arranger, and conductor. Rhodes made history as a black music director by being the first to work for a major network (at NBC in 1966 for The Sammy Davis Jr. Show) and to work for a Las Vegas showroom (at the Tropicana Hotel in 1973). After being hired as a temporary pianist for Davis in 1955, Rhodes eventually became his principal arranger and conductor, working on his variety act, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, three of Davis' television specials, two musicals starring Davis, and three albums." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Rhodes_(musician)> .

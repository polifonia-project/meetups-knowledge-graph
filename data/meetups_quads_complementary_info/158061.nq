<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burl_Ives> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14, 1909 â€“ April 14, 1995) was an American musician, actor, and author with a career that spanned more than six decades. Ives began his career as an itinerant singer and guitarist, eventually launching his own radio show, The Wayfaring Stranger, which popularized traditional folk songs. In 1942, he appeared in Irving Berlin's This Is the Army and became a major star of CBS Radio. In the 1960s, he successfully crossed over into country music, recording hits such as \"A Little Bitty Tear\" and \"Funny Way of Laughin'\". Ives was also a popular film actor through the late 1940s and '50s. His film roles included parts in So Dear to My Heart (1948) and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), as well as the role of Rufus Hannassey in The Big Country (1958), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ives is often associated with the Christmas season. He did voice-over work as Sam the Snowman, narrator of the classic 1964 Christmas television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Ives also worked on the special's soundtrack, including the songs \"A Holly Jolly Christmas\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", both of which continue to chart annually on the Billboard holiday charts into the 2020s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burl_Ives> .

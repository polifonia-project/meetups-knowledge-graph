<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scatman_John> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Paul Larkin (March 13, 1942 â€“ December 3, 1999), known professionally as Scatman John, was an American musician. A prolific jazz pianist and vocalist for several decades, he rose to prominence during the 1990s through his fusion of scat singing and dance music. He recorded five albums, which were released between 1986 and 2001. In the United States and Europe, Larkin is recognized for his 1995 singles \"Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)\" and \"Scatman's World\". He achieved his greatest success in Japan, where his album Scatman's World (1995) sold over a million copies. Larkin was also a recipient of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's Annie Glenn Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community and a posthumous inductee to the National Stuttering Association Hall of Fame." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scatman_John> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caspar_Brötzmann> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Caspar Brötzmann (born 13 December 1962) is a German guitarist, vocalist and bandleader. Brötzmann typically performs with the power trio lineup of Caspar Brötzmann Massaker (his early band), with guitar, bass guitar and drums. He uses rock and roll and heavy metal music as a basis for his music, which often features lengthy songs that start slow and quiet but gradually build to a ferocious climax. Brötzmann's technique has been praised: \"...his attack on the instrument — explosive, obstreperous, large scale, textural, timbral — asserts the material facts of string-pickup-amplifier more bluntly than anyone else currently involved in rock\". Brötzmann's father, Peter Brötzmann, is a free jazz saxophone player. In 1990 they recorded the album Last Home as a duo." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caspar_Brötzmann> .

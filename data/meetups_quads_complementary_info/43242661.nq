He most recently competed part-time in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East in 2018, a series which he competed in for over a decade and a half. In addition, MacDonald raced numerous times in the American Canadian Tour between 2007 and 2018 (including two full seasons in 2016 and 2018), and in the PASS (Pro All Star Series) North. MacDonald has made starts in all three of NASCAR's national touring series, the K&N Pro Series East, and the Whelen Modified Tour. Much of MacDonald's success has home at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, where he has five wins in the ACT, three in the Pro Series East, and one with the PASS (Pro All Star Series) North. MacDonald also won at Bristol Motor Speedway. He is also a back-to-back, two-time champion of the Oxford 250, winning in 2009 and 2010; MacDonald is only one of three drivers to ever have consecutive wins at Oxford Plains Speedway.

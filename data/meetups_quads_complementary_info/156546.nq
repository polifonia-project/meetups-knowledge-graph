<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stepin_Fetchit> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry (May 30, 1902 â€“ November 19, 1985), better known by the stage name Stepin Fetchit, was an American vaudevillian, comedian, and film actor of Jamaican and Bahamian descent, considered to be the first black actor to have a successful film career. His highest profile was during the 1930s in films and on stage, when his persona of Stepin Fetchit was billed as the \"Laziest Man in the World\". Perry parlayed the Fetchit persona into a successful film career, becoming the first black actor to earn $1 million. He was also the first black actor to receive featured screen credit in a film. Perry's film career slowed after 1939 and nearly stopped altogether after 1953. Around that time, Black Americans began to see his Stepin Fetchit persona as an embarrassing and harmful anachronism, echoing negative stereotypes. However, the Stepin Fetchit character has undergone a re-evaluation by some scholars in recent times, who view him as an embodiment of the trickster archetype." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stepin_Fetchit> .

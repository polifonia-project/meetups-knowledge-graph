He has won several music awards, including the awards for Best African Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007, Artist of the Year at the MTV Africa Music Awards 2009, Best International Act: Africa at the 2011 BET Awards, and Best-selling African Artist at the 2014 World Music Awards, Evolution award at the 2015 MTV Africa Music awards Oyebanjo adopted the stage name D'banj, a combination of his first name, Dapo, and his surname, Oyebanjo. D'banj is best known internationally for his 2012 summer hit \"Oliver Twist\", an uptempo dance fusion of Afrobeats and electronic dance music that topped the African charts in 2011 and was a top 10 hit in the UK singles chart in 2012 reaching No. 2 on the UK R&B chart. He said the year 2021 would be marked in Grand styles and he would release his album tittled \"Ikebe\" before the end of the first quarter. He also shared a healthy rivalry with another Nigerian great artiste Innocent Idibia popularly known as 2Face or 2Baba which helped keep him on his toes to always create good music for years before he was signed to Kenya West G.O.O.D Music Record Label in June 2011." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/D'banj> .

Known for his variegated vocals, Malone has gained acclaim for blending genres and subgenres of hip hop, pop, R&B, and trap. His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator. Malone began his music career in 2011 and gained recognition with his 2015 debut single \"White Iverson\", which peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Malone signed a recording contract with Republic Records and released his debut album Stoney (2016); it contained the diamond single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo) and set the record for most weeks (77) on the US Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. His second album, Beerbongs & Bentleys (2018), debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and set several streaming records. It also contained the US number-one singles \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage) and \"Psycho\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign) and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 61st Grammy Awards. His third number one, \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee), was the promotional and lead single to the soundtrack for the film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), and was included on Malone's third album, Hollywood's Bleeding (2019); the album was his second number one. Its second single, \"Circles\", reached number one and set the record for most weeks (39) in the top ten on the Hot 100. His fourth album, Twelve Carat Toothache, was released in June 2022, spearheaded by the US top-ten singles \"I Like You (A Happier Song)\" (featuring Doja Cat) and \"One Right Now\" (with The Weeknd). Among the best-selling music artists with over 80 million records sold, Malone has won 10 Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, and one MTV Video Music Award, and received nine Grammy Award nominations. He holds several Billboard chart records: he is the first solo artist to top the Rap Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, while \"Circles\" set the record for longest climb to number one (41 weeks) on the Adult Contemporary chart by a solo artist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Post_Malone> .

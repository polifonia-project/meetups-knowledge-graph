<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leigh_Bowery> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Leigh Bowery (26 March 1961 â€“ 31 December 1994) was an Australian performance artist, club promoter, and fashion designer. Bowery was known for his flamboyant and outlandish costumes and makeup as well as his (sometimes controversial) performances. Based in London for much of his adult life, he was a significant model and muse for the English painter Lucian Freud. Bowery's friend and fellow performer Boy George said he saw Bowery's outrageous performances a number of times, and that it \"never ceased to impress or revolt\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leigh_Bowery> .

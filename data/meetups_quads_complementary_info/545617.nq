<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Steranko> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James F. Steranko (/stəˈræŋkoʊ/; born November 5, 1938) is an American graphic artist, comic book writer/artist, comics historian, magician, publisher and film production illustrator. His most famous comic book work was with the 1960s superspy feature \"Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" in Marvel Comics' Strange Tales and in the subsequent eponymous series. Steranko earned lasting acclaim for his innovations in sequential art during the Silver Age of Comic Books, particularly his infusion of surrealism, pop art, and graphic design into the medium. His work has been published in many countries and his influence on the field has remained strong since his comics heyday. He went on to create book covers, become a comics historian who published a pioneering two-volume history of the birth and early years of comic books, and to create conceptual art and character designs for films including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Bram Stoker's Dracula. He was inducted into the comic-book industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Steranko> .

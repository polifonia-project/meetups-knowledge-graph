<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julie_Verhoeven> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Julie Verhoeven (born 16 May 1969) is a British illustrator and designer who has collaborated with brands such as Louis Vuitton, Versace and Peter Jensen. While she is recognised primarily for her work in fashion, she has also contributed illustrations to books, magazines and album covers. Her work has been widely exhibited, including at London's Hayward Gallery. She is a design academic at both Central Saint Martins and the Royal College of Art. With recurring retro references – particularly to the 1970s and pop culture – her illustrations have been described as \"whimsical\" and \"Rock & Roll meets rainbow\". The Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) noted that: \"Her drawings, sculptures, assemblages, installations and video combine a rawness, at times reminiscent of punk, with a bewildering sensuality and a strong sense of colour and texture\". In a 2008 interview, she said: \"For the moment I am doing artist/designer... I would like to be regarded as an artist eventually\". In 2012, the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) acquired a large archive of her work (over 100 illustrations) for its permanent collection." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julie_Verhoeven> .

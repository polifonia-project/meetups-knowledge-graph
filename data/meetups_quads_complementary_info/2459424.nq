<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Hoffmann_(photographer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Heinrich Hoffmann (12 September 1885 â€“ 15 December 1957) was Adolf Hitler's official photographer, and a Nazi politician and publisher, who was a member of Hitler's intimate circle. Hoffmann's photographs were a significant part of Hitler's propaganda campaign to present himself and the Nazi Party as a significant mass phenomenon. He received royalties from all uses of Hitler's image, even on postage stamps, which made him a millionaire over the course of Hitler's rule. After the Second World War he was tried and sentenced to four years in prison for war profiteering. He was classified by the Allies' Art Looting Investigators to be a \"major offender\" in Nazi art plundering of Jews, as both art dealer and collector and his art collection, which contained many artworks looted from Jews, was ordered confiscated by the Allies. In 1956, the Bavarian State ordered all art under its control and formerly possessed by Hoffmann to be returned to him." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Hoffmann_(photographer)> .

In the early 1970s, he also managed a Los Angeles nightclub called Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco. Bingenheimer helped numerous bands become successful in the American market. He developed a reputation for being the first American DJ to identify new artists and play \"edgy new bands\" such as Blondie, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Van Halen, Guns N' Roses, Duran Duran, The Cure, Joan Jett, The Hollywood Squares, Hole, Symbol Six, No Doubt, Blur, Nirvana, Sonic Youth, The Bangles, X, The Pandoras, Germs and many others. In 2003, Bingenheimer was the subject of the documentary Mayor of the Sunset Strip. He was described as a \"famous groupie, now respectable\" by Mick Jagger, and the film documented Bingenheimer's status as a person with numerous high-profile friends. In 2007, he was honored with the 2,330th star on Hollywood Boulevard. In 2017, Bingenheimer joined SiriusXM's Little Steven's Underground Garage." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rodney_Bingenheimer> .

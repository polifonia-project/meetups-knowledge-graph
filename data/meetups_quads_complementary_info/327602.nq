<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Palmer_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Allen Palmer (19 January 1949 â€“ 26 September 2003) was an English singer-songwriter, musician and record producer. He was known for his powerful, soulful voice and sartorial elegance, and for his stylistic explorations, combining soul, funk, jazz, rock, pop, reggae, and blues. While his \"four-decade career incorporated every genre of music\", Palmer is best known \"for the pounding rock-soul classic, \"Addicted to Love\", and its accompanying video, which came to epitomise the glamour and excesses of the 1980s.\" Having started in the music industry in the 1960s, including a spell with Vinegar Joe, he found success in the 1980s, both in his solo career and with the Power Station, scoring Top 10 hits in the United Kingdom and the United States. Three of his hit singles, including \"Addicted to Love\", featured music videos directed by British fashion photographer Terence Donovan. Palmer received a number of awards throughout his career, including two Grammy Awards for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and an MTV Video Music Award. He was also nominated by the Brit Award for Best British Male Solo Artist. He died at age 54, following a heart attack." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Palmer_(singer)> .

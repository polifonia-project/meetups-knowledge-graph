<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emmanuel_Saez> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Emmanuel Saez (born November 26, 1972) is a French, naturalized American economist who is Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. His work, done with Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman, includes tracking the incomes of the poor, middle class and rich around the world. Their work shows that top earners in the United States have taken an increasingly larger share of overall income over the last three decades, with almost as much inequality as before the Great Depression. He recommends much higher (marginal) taxes on the rich, up to 70% or 90%. He received the John Bates Clark Medal in 2009, a MacArthur \"Genius\" Fellowship in 2010, and an honorary degree from Harvard University in 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emmanuel_Saez> .

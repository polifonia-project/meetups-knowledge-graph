Parnas, Giuliani, Igor Fruman, John Solomon, Yuriy Lutsenko, Dmytro Firtash and his allies, Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova were involved in the Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal. President Trump claims he was not fully aware of their efforts in 2018 and 2019 to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation into a political rival. In October 2021, Parnas was found guilty in U.S. Federal Court on six counts related to illegal donations to the 2020 campaign of Donald Trump. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison, three years of supervised release and $2,322,500 in restitution on June 29, 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lev_Parnas> .

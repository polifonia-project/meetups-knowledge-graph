<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dick_Rowe> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Paul Brutton Rowe (9 June 1921 â€“ 6 June 1986) was a British music executive and record producer. He was head of A&R (Singles) at Decca Records from the 1950s to the 1970s, and produced many top-selling records during that period. He is historically presented in popular music history as the man who did not sign the Beatles. In Brian Epstein's 1964 autobiography, Rowe is quoted as having rejected them with the words: \"Guitar groups are on their way out, Mr. Epstein\", although he denied ever having said this. He later signed the Rolling Stones after their audition, thanks to an introduction and encouragement from George Harrison." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dick_Rowe> .

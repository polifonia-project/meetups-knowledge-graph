<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Allingham> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Allingham (19 March 1824 â€“ 18 November 1889) was an Irish poet, diarist and editor. He wrote several volumes of lyric verse, and his poem \"The Faeries\" was much anthologised. But he is better known for his posthumously published Diary, in which he records his lively encounters with Tennyson, Carlyle and other writers and artists. His wife, Helen Allingham, was a well-known watercolourist and illustrator." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Allingham> .

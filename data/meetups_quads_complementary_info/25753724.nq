Ridley was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm roundarm fast. Ridley made his first-class debut for Hampshire against Kent in the 1884. During the match Ridley made 41 runs, which was his highest first-class score. Ridley also claimed his only two wickets in first-class cricket in the Kent second innings. His bowling figures were 2/30 from 14 overs. Ridley's final first-class match came in 1885 against Derbyshire. The 1885 season was also Hampshire's final season with first-class status until the 1895 County Championship.

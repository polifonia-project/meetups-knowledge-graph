<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Powell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Scott Powell (born August 13, 1948) is an American musician and a former founding member of Sha Na Na, which began at Columbia University in 1969, under the name The Kingsmen. The group's name was later changed to avoid confusion with another band of the same name. Powell performed with Sha Na Na at the Woodstock Festival and in Japan and Europe. He was known as Santini on the Sha Na Na television series, which aired from 1977 to 1981. He sang many Elvis Presley songs on the show. He was also in the movie Grease with Sha Na Na, singing lead on the song Hound Dog. When Powell left the group in 1981, he went back to Columbia and took premedical courses, and has pursued a successful career as an orthopedic surgeon." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Powell> .

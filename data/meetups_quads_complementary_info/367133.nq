<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Weiland> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Scott Richard Weiland (/ˈwaɪlənd/; né Kline, October 27, 1967 – December 3, 2015) was an American singer and songwriter. During a career spanning three decades, Weiland was best known as the lead singer of the rock band Stone Temple Pilots from 1989 to 2002 and 2008 to 2013, making six records with them. He was also lead vocalist of supergroup Velvet Revolver from 2003 to 2008, recording two albums, and recorded one album with another supergroup, Art of Anarchy. Weiland established himself as a solo artist as well and collaborated with several other musicians throughout his career. Weiland was known for his flamboyant and chaotic onstage persona; he was also known for constantly changing his appearance and vocal style, for his use of a megaphone in concerts for vocal effect, and for his battles with substance abuse. Now widely viewed as a talented and versatile vocalist, Weiland has been ranked No. 57 in the Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists by Hit Parader. In 2012, Weiland formed the backing band the Wildabouts. The band received mixed reviews, and some critics and fans noted Weiland's failing health. In December 2015, Weiland died of an accidental drug overdose on his tour bus in Minnesota at the age of 48. Upon his death, many critics and peers offered re-evaluations of Weiland's life and career; those critics included David Fricke of Rolling Stone and Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, who identified Weiland as one of the \"voices of the generation\" alongside Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley, and Chris Cornell." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Weiland> .

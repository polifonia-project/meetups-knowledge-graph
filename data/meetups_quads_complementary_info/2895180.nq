With the band, Honeyman-Scott established a reputation, in the words of AllMusic, as \"one of the most original and versatile guitarists of the early-'80s new wave movement.\" In addition to his role as lead guitarist, Honeyman-Scott co-wrote a number of songs for the band, sang back-up vocals and played keyboards on a few tracks. The song \"2000 Miles\" was written for him by Chrissie Hynde and released the year after his death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Honeyman-Scott> .

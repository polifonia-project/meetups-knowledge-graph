<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Kellogg_(naturalist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Kellogg (October 2, 1868 â€“ September 5, 1949) was an American vaudeville performer who imitated bird songs, and later a campaigner for the protection of the redwood forests of California. He was born on a ranch in Susanville, California and grew up in the 1870s observing the animals and birds of the forests and learning outdoor skills. He constructed a mobile home, called the \"Travel Log\", out of a redwood tree and drove it around the country to raise awareness of the plight of the California forests. Its maximum speed was 18 mph. The Travel Log itself is currently on display in the Visitor Center at Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Pat Foster of Hemmings Classic Car magazine wrote \"the vehicle itself was incredible, a monument to man and nature. It consisted of a huge chunk of giant redwood-said to be the single largest piece of hewn timber in the world-hollowed out and mounted on what was then the toughest, most rugged chassis on earth: the Nash Quad.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Kellogg_(naturalist)> .

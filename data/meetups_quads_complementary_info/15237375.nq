<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lillian_Briggs> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lillian Briggs (née Biggs; June 3, 1932 – April 11, 1998) was an American rock 'n roll performer and musician. Briggs was the first woman to achieve star status at the dawn of rock 'n roll in the early 1950s; soon after embarking upon her career, as she toured Australia with Nat King Cole in early 1956, she began being billed as \"The Queen of Rock and Roll\". This was during the same period that the media began referring to Elvis Presley as the \"King\" of the new musical genre." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lillian_Briggs> .

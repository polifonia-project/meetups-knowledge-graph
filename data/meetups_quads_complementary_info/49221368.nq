<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariel_Shearer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ariel Shearer (c. 1905 – ?) was an Australian composer and classical pianist. She learned piano under William Silver (born March 1878), who also trained Elder Scholars Merle Robertson, John Bishop, Miriam Hyde and Ruth Naylor. She left Adelaide in 1924 to study at the Royal College of Music. On her departure for London, Charles Cawthorne organised a benefit concert for her in the Adelaide Town Hall, which featured William Silver, George Pearce, Charles Schilsky, , Harold Wylde FRCO, Vera Thrush AMUA, Hilda Gill AMUA, F. Stone, and basso Richard Watkins. She returned to Adelaide three years later, and was reported as having appreciated the experience, but was handicapped by a shortage of money and having to board with a family who were not musically inclined. In 1931, she and Charlotte Grivell (mezzo-soprano), a fellow student in London, were appointed choral liaison commissioners for Girl Guides in South Australia. The two held joint concerts during the ensuing decade then appear to have retired from the stage. They were also keen equestrians, and neither married. Her sister, Charlotte Annie \"Lottie\" Creedy, née Shearer, (12 December 1894– ), was a successful piano teacher." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ariel_Shearer> .

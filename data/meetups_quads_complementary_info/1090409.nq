<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liam_Clancy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Liam Clancy (Irish: Liam Mac Fhlannchadha; 2 September 1935 â€“ 4 December 2009) was an Irish folk singer from Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. He was the youngest member of the influential folk group the Clancy Brothers, regarded as Ireland's first pop stars. They achieved global sales of millions and appeared in sold-out concerts at such prominent venues as Carnegie Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. Liam was generally considered to be the group's most powerful vocalist. Bob Dylan regarded him as the greatest ballad singer ever. In 1976, as part of the duo Makem and Clancy, he had a number one hit in Ireland with the anti-war song \"And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\" (written by Scots-Australian Eric Bogle). Upon his death The Irish Times said his legacy was secured." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liam_Clancy> .

McCargo is also a visiting scholar at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University, and an associate fellow of the New-York-based Asia Society. He attended Sandbach School and later gained three degrees from the University of London: a First in English (Royal Holloway 1986); then an MA in Area Studies (Southeast Asia) (1990) and a PhD in Politics (1993) from the School of Oriental and African Studies. He was an undergraduate exchange student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. McCargo has also taught at Queen's University, Belfast, and at Kobe Gakuin University, Japan.

His only show with the band so far took place at Dutch Comic Con. In June 2016, he joined Dead by Wednesday as a second guitarist. He was known to wear, in the early years, a backpack on stage during the shows. While primarily regarded as a metal guitarist, Rizzo's solo work demonstrates an interest in a wide range of styles, combining elements of hard rock, metal, jazz, classical and flamenco guitar. 2007 saw him headline his first US tour to sell out venues across the country. In 2008, Rizzo's two solo records were released under Shrapnel Records and are available on iTunes (iTunes.com). Rizzo was endorsed by Peavey and Yamaha, and traveled the world undertaking clinics for Peavey when his tour schedule allowed. Rizzo, as of 2009, is endorsed by B.C. Rich. A signature seven-string Stealth model has been built for him and made available for to the public as an import model in 2010. He has been using PRS SE Custom 24 seven-string guitars.

Since has released two sampler CD's (international distro) and three full-lengths. Rizzo grew up in Carlstadt, New Jersey, where he attended Henry P. Becton Regional High School. In 2020, Rizzo started his new death metal side project Revenge Beast. In August 2021, Rizzo departed Soulfly after 18 years with the band. Rizzo said in an interview that he got no support from Soulfly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rizzo went further saying “I was doing home renovations, working very hard, 10 hours a day,” he explained. “A Soulfly live record came out [last year, Live Ritual NYC MMXIX]. I never saw a dime of that. So basically, within the [first] six [or] seven months of Covid, I just said, ‘You know, man, I don't want this anymore. I gave you guys 18 years of my life, “And it was a great time. Back in the good years, it was great. But the last eight to 10 years have not been very good\". In October 2021, Marc Rizzo returned to Ill Niño, where he performed as their original guitarist from 1998 until his departure in 2003." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marc_Rizzo> .

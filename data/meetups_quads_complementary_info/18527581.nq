He became interested in dance music, organizing parties by age 16 and mixing on radio by age 17. He and founded and Warehouse Records in 1988, the latter releasing Armando's singles \"151\" and \"Land of Confusion\". \"Land of Confusion\" became a transatlantic club hit in Chicago as well as in Britain, where it influenced their early acid-house scene. He also produced Warehouse releases from Ron Trent, DJ Rush, and . Instead of working on production, Armando spent most of the early 1990s with a residency at Chicago's new Warehouse club (in Randolph Street) from 1992 to 1994.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sydney_Beck> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sydney Beck (2 September 1906 â€“ 7 April 2001) was an American musicologist, music educator, violinist and viol player. As a scholar, he was considered an authority on English music of the 16th through 18th centuries. One of his major contributions was his research on composer Thomas Morley which led to the modern publication of Morley's The First Book of Consort Lessons in 1959. Beck led his own ensemble, The Consort Players, in performances of Morley's music and other works by Morley's contemporaries; performances which contributed to the interest in reviving broken consort music in the 20th century." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sydney_Beck> .

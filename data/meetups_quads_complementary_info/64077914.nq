<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Chauvin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Derek Michael Chauvin (/ˈʃoʊvən/ SHOH-vən; born March 19, 1976) is an American former police officer who was convicted for the murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Chauvin was a member of the Minneapolis Police Department from 2001 to 2020. Chauvin had knelt on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on the street calling out \"I can't breathe\" during an arrest made with three other officers on May 25, 2020. He was dismissed by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) on May 26 and arrested on May 29. The murder set off a series of protests in the Twin Cities and across the rest of the United States, later spreading around the world. On March 8, 2021, Chauvin was put on trial for unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter before a jury in the Minnesota Fourth Judicial District Court. On April 20, he was convicted of the charges. On June 25, he was sentenced to 22+1⁄2 years in prison (minus the 199 days of credit he received for time served), with possibility of supervised release contingent on factors such as good behavior after serving two-thirds of his sentence (the sentence before any deductions of time), or 15 years for this second-degree murder conviction. In December 2021, Chauvin pled guilty to federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights by using unreasonable force and ignoring Floyd's serious medical needs. Simultaneously, Chauvin pled guilty to violating a 14-year-old boy's civil rights in 2017 by using unreasonable force. On July 7, 2022, Chauvin was sentenced to 21 years in prison on the charges of violating Floyd's civil rights. The federal and state sentences are to run concurrently. The Minnesota Department of Corrections lists Chauvin’s anticipated release date on the state sentence as December 10, 2035." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Chauvin> .

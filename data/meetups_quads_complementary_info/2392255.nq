<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Small_(cricketer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Small (19 April 1737 â€“ 31 December 1826) was an English professional cricketer who played during the 18th century and had one of the longest careers on record. Born at Empshott, Hampshire, he is generally regarded as the greatest batsman of the 18th century and acknowledged as having been the first to master the use of the modern straight bat which was introduced in the 1760s. He probably scored the earliest known century in important cricket. He died at Petersfield, where he was in residence for most of his life and where he established businesses. Small was a very influential player who was involved in the creation of two significant permanent additions to the Laws of Cricket: the maximum width of the bat and the introduction of the middle stump in the wicket. Acclaimed as the greatest player associated with the famous Hambledon Club, Small is the first person known to have been described in literature in terms that attest him to have been a \"superstar\". In 1997, he was named by The Times as one of its 100 Greatest Cricketers of All Time." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Small_(cricketer)> .

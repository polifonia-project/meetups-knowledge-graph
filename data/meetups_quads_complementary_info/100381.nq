<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sammo_Hung> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sammo Hung Kam-bo (Chinese: 洪金寶; Jyutping: Hung4 Gam1-bou2; born 7 January 1952) is a Hong Kong actor, martial artist, film producer and director, known for his work in martial arts films, Hong Kong action cinema, and as a fight choreographer for other actors such as Jackie Chan. Hung is one of the pivotal figures who spearheaded the Hong Kong New Wave movement of the 1980s, helped reinvent the martial arts genre and started the vampire-like jiangshi genre. He is widely credited with assisting many of his compatriots, giving them their starts in the Hong Kong film industry, by casting them in the films he produced, or giving them roles in the production crew. Both Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan were often addressed as \"Dai Goh”, meaning Big Brother, until the filming of Project A, which featured both actors. As Hung was the eldest of the kung fu \"brothers\", and the first to make a mark on the industry, he was given the nickname “Dai Goh Dai\", meaning, Big, Big Brother, or Biggest Big Brother." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sammo_Hung> .

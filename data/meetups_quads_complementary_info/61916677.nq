Music critic Hagamenon Brito considered him one of the three greatest Brazilian pop rock bassists of all time alongside Paulo Roberto Diniz \"PJ\" Júnior of Jota Quest and Alexandre Dengue of Nação Zumbi, and Emir Ruivo of webzine El Hombre compared him to Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea. Shortly after his death in 2013, caused by a self-inflicted gunshot wound following increasing bouts of anxiety and depression, he was featured in entertainment website Punk Brega's list of the Top 10 Greatest Brazilian Rock Bassists of All Time, in 10th place." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Champignon_(musician)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hank_Wangford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Samuel Hutt, known by the stage name Hank Wangford (born 15 November 1940), is an English country and western songwriter. \"Hank is a good smoke screen. He can do things I can't do. He's my clown,\" says Dr. Hutt, who has been struggling to balance his musical and medical interests ever since medical school at Cambridge University. His 1960s practice in a drug-addiction centre brought him into contact with a lot of rockers and wide renown as London's long-haired, rock-and-roll doctor, and later a television series. \"If The Who had a first night, the tickets would be sent. I actually had more of an identity crisis with that than with Hank, because Hank is a fool. I quite like him. Dr. Sam was definitely threatening to become a monster.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hank_Wangford> .

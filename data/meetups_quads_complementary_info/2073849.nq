<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Fisher_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "George Fisher (born July 8, 1970), better known by his stage name Corpsegrinder, is an American death metal vocalist who is the lead singer of Cannibal Corpse, Paths of Possession and the supergroup Serpentine Dominion. He recorded two albums with Florida's Monstrosity before leaving and joining Cannibal Corpse in late 1995, replacing vocalist Chris Barnes, who is now the vocalist for Six Feet Under. Fisher released his debut solo album Corpsegrinder on February 25, 2022. Fisher has also provided guest vocals for New York technical death metal band Suffocation on the songs \"Reincremation\" and \"Mass Obliteration\" from their debut album, Effigy of the Forgotten (1991), as well as guest vocals for California deathcore band Suicide Silence on the song \"Control\" from their fourth album, You Can't Stop Me. Fisher also performed guest vocals on Job for a Cowboy's 2014 album Sun Eater on the song \"The Synthetic Sea.\" In 2021, Fisher performed guest vocals for Boston metalcore band Ice Nine Kills on the song \"Take Your Pick\", a tribute to My Bloody Valentine from the bandâ€™s album The Silver Scream 2: Welcome to Horrorwood. As a death metal vocalist, Fisher employs the \"death growl\" extended vocal technique. Fisher has also gained much popularity through the size of his neck. He has explained multiple times that the size of his neck is due to a combination of headbanging and lifting weights when he was younger." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Fisher_(musician)> .

He was active as a solo artist and session musician, but is perhaps best known for his work as a touring back-up singer with artists such as James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Phil Collins, Beck, Bonnie Raitt, and Todd Rundgren. He toured for forty-five years with Taylor and is an audience favorite for his featured vocal parts on the songs \"Shower the People\", \"I Will Follow\", and \"Is That the Way You Look\". He has also toured extensively with Collins and is one of the main lead vocalists on the live version of \"Easy Lover\". In 2010 McCuller joined the Troubadour Reunion Tour supporting James Taylor and Carole King." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arnold_McCuller> .

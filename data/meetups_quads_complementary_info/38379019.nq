<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Jane_Phillips-Matz> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Jane Phillips-Matz (January 30, 1926 â€“ January 19, 2013) was an American biographer and writer on opera. She is mainly known for her biography of Giuseppe Verdi, a result of 30 years' research and published in 1992 by Oxford University Press. Born in Lebanon, Ohio and educated at Smith College and Columbia University, she lived for many years in Italy, and even after her return to the United States in the early 1970s spent her summers in Verdi's hometown of Busseto where she continued her exhaustive research into his life. She died in New York City at the age of 86, survived by three of her five children." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Jane_Phillips-Matz> .

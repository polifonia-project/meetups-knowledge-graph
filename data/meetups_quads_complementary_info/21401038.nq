He played college football at Nebraska, where he earned All-American honors, and was drafted by the Detroit Lions second overall in the 2010 NFL Draft. He also played for the Miami Dolphins, Los Angeles Rams, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has played in two Super Bowls: Super Bowl LIII with the Rams and Super Bowl LV with the Buccaneers. As a college senior, Suh became one of the most decorated players in college football history. He won numerous awards including the Associated Press College Football Player of the Year Award, Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award, Lombardi Award, and Outland Trophy, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. During his time with the Lions, Suh was selected to 4 All-Pro and Pro Bowl teams and was awarded Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2010. In 2015, Suh became the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, having signed a six-year contract with the Miami Dolphins, worth in excess of $114 million, with nearly $60 million fully guaranteed; he was released after just three seasons. Early in his career, Suh was criticized for his aggressive style of play and lack of sportsmanship. Suh was one of four defensive tackles named to the NFL 2010's All-Decade Team." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ndamukong_Suh> .

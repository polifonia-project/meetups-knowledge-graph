His first piano solo ECM album Akroasis, mentioned by \"The Independent\" writer Andrew Clarke as: \"The effects are hypnotic and mysterious, shimmering like ancient mosaic\". A reviewer of his album Melos commented that \"Tsabropoulos' compositions have a static beauty and drama [... that draw] their inspiration from Greek folk music and Byzantine hymns\". JazzTimes magazine called the album The Triangle a combination of jazz, tango, and classical music. Arild Adersen also commented: \"What struck me straight away was the fact that his exceptional classical technique never got in the way of his jazz feeling\". The \"Times\" reviewer Mike Bradley, commented that: \"Athenian pianist Vassilis Tsabropoulos is one of those rare musicians who is equally at home in both the classical and jazz worlds. His album Achirana demonstrates that, while noted principally for his prowess as a classical pianist, conductor and composer, he also has much to say in a jazz idiom. Accompanied by Norwegian bassist Arild Andersen and British veteran drummer John Marshall, he has assembled an exquisite record filled with fluid, fluent improvisations, which transport and delight. Sample the fearlessly slow gems \"Diamond Cut Diamond\" and \"Valley\" and be amazed\". He collaborated also with the german cellist , performing classic repertoire and his compositions. Also, he has formed a piano duet with the pianist Vovka Ashkenazy playing concerts in France, Iceland and Greece. Since 2013, he has formed a duet with the acclaimed performer of byzantine sacred music Nektaria Karantzi, in an artistic combination inspired by byzantine hymns and traditional greek music.

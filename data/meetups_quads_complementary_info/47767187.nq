He was a central and influential figure in the Houston hip hop community and was the leader of Houston's Screwed Up Click. Davis released over 350 mixtapes and was recognized as an innovator mostly on a regional level until his death of codeine overdose in 2000. His legacy was discovered by a wider audience around 2005, and has gone on to influence a wide variety of artists." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/DJ_Screw> .

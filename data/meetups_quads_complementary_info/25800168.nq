<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_McClellan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen T. McClellan (born March 22, 1950) is an American concert promoter and educator. For 30 years he worked at a series of nightclubs housed in a former bus depot at the corner of First Avenue and 7th Street in downtown Minneapolis, promoting the careers of local musicians and expanding the reach of talent from around the world. These clubs—beginning with The Depot, Uncle Sam's, and Sam's (and 7th St. Entry)—eventually became the First Avenue & 7th St. Entry nightclub that buoyed the Minneapolis sound and contributed to the development of alternative rock and independent music. McClellan is number 1 on a list of Unforgettable Minnesota Characters. At First Avenue, a music critic gave him the nickname \"Chainsaw.\" Later, he taught music business and arts management at colleges in the Twin Cities. McClellan founded DEMO (originally as DMAF later DAMF) in 1999 to help aspiring musicians succeed." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_McClellan> .

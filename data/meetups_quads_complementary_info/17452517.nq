He lives in Oakland, California where he writes, arranges and produces songs. He plays drums in the Oakland based bands, REQ'D, Slow Phase and Lefav.

He shared substitute drumming duties during these shows together with Josh Klinghoffer and Dave Krusen. For his debut album, Stuverud worked with lyricist, Derek McCulloch on “Memories in Kodachrome,” released on May 1, 2020. The follow-up full length album, \"Hummingbirds\" was released in March, 2022. A 7\" vinyl, \"Not Afraid/Put your Guns Down\" written by Stuverud in response to the Paris attacks and against gun violence was produced by Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament and released by Monkey Wrench Records in 2017. Known for playing in several bands in the Seattle scene, his first was the punk rock band The Fastbacks. Through the mid-90s, Stuverud played in the bands Three Fish and Tres Mts., both side projects of Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament. Three Fish released the albums Three Fish (1996) and The Quiet Table (1999), through Epic Records. The album Tres Mts. (Three Mountains), with Doug Pinnick of King's X and guest guitarist Mike McCready, was released in 2011. Pearl Jam's 2011 box set, Vitalogy, includes the previously-unreleased demo version of \"Nothingman\" with Stuverud on drums. In 2012, he worked again with Jeff Ament, this time with NYC singer-songwriter, Joseph Arthur, to form the band, RNDM. They released their debut album, Acts (2012) and followed up with Ghost Riding (2016). Stuverud has collaborated with Ament on his solo albums, including I Should be Outside(2020), Tone (2008) and While my Heart Beats (2012).

Stuverud has recorded and toured internationally with South African artist, Robbi Robb in Tribe After Tribe, Nash Kato of Urge Overkill, U.K. artists, Paul Newsome and Proud Mary, and the NYC band, White Light Motorcade.

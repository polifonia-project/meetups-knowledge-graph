While still in high school in 2002, Beckett and guitarist Mike Carden came together from rival bands in Chicago to form The Academy Is... In addition to founding the band, Beckett and Carden are credited as the primary songwriters. A third core member of the band was Adam T. Siska, Beckett's classmate and friend from Barrington High School. In 2007, Alex Davies from the BBC described Beckett as a mix of Adam Lazzara and Prince, labeling him \"utterly captivating\". The Academy Is... reunited at Riot Fest 2015 in the fall of 2015 in Chicago. Although Beckett had said the occasion would serve as a \"farewell\" show, the band later had an additional final tour in late 2015." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Beckett_(singer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barbara_Cartland> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dame Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland, DBE, DStJ (9 July 1901 – 21 May 2000) published as Barbara Cartland was an English writer, known as the Queen of Romance, who published both contemporary and historical romance novels, the latter set primarily during the Victorian or Edwardian period. Cartland is one of the best-selling authors worldwide of the 20th century. Many of her novels have been adapted to films for television including A Hazard of Hearts and Duel of Hearts. Her novels have been translated from English into numerous languages, making Cartland the fifth most translated author worldwide. Her prolific output totals some 723 novels and she is credited in the Guinness World Records for the most novels published in a single year (1977). Although best known for her romantic novels, she also wrote non-fiction titles including biographies, plays, music, verse, drama, operettas, and several health and cook books. She also contributed advice to TV audiences and newspaper magazine articles. She sold more than 750 million copies of her books, though other sources estimate her total sales at more than two billion. The covers of her novels featured portrait-style artwork, usually designed by Francis Marshall (1901–1980). Cartland was also a businesswoman who was head of Cartland Promotions. She was a London society figure, often dressed in a pink chiffon gown, a plumed hat, blonde wig, and heavy make-up." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barbara_Cartland> .

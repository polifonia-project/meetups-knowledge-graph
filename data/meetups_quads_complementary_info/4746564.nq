After leaving the band, Mitchell formed his own group, Mitch Mitchell's Terrifying Experience. In late 2010, Guided by Voices embarked on a short reunion tour, resulting in a new \"Classic Lineup\" Guided By Voices album, Let's Go Eat The Factory. The reunion spanned four years and six albums before disbanding once more in September 2014." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitch_Mitchell_(guitarist)> .

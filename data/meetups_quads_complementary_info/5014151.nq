<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Engelbert_Humperdinck_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Arnold George Dorsey MBE (born 2 May 1936), known professionally as Engelbert Humperdinck, is an English pop singer who has been described as \"one of the finest middle-of-the-road balladeers around\". He achieved international prominence in 1967 with his recording of \"Release Me\". Starting as a performer under the name of Gerry Dorsey in the late 1950s, he later adopted the name of the German composer Engelbert Humperdinck as a stage name and found success after he partnered with manager Gordon Mills in 1965. His recordings of the ballads \"Release Me\" and \"The Last Waltz\" both topped the UK Singles Chart in 1967, selling more than a million copies each. Humperdinck scored further major hits in rapid succession, including \"There Goes My Everything\" (1967), \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" (1968) and \"A Man Without Love\" (1968). In the process, he attained a large following, with some of his most devoted fans calling themselves \"Humperdinckers\". Three of his singles were among the best-selling of the 1960s in the United Kingdom. During the 1970s, Humperdinck had significant North American chart successes with \"After the Lovin'\" (1976) and \"This Moment in Time\" (1979). Having garnered a reputation as a prolific concert performer, he received renewed attention during the 1990s lounge revival with his recordings of \"Lesbian Seagull\" for the soundtrack of Beavis and Butt-head Do America (1996), and a dance album (1998). The new millennium brought a range of musical projects for the singer, including the Grammy-nominated gospel album Always Hear The Harmony: The Gospel Sessions (2003) and a double album of duets, Engelbert Calling (2014). In 2012, Humperdinck represented the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest in Baku with the song \"Love Will Set You Free\". After marking more than 50 years as a successful singer, Humperdinck continues to record and tour, having sold more than 140 million records worldwide." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Engelbert_Humperdinck_(singer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Lopez> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert \"Bobby\" Lopez (born February 23, 1975) is an American songwriter for musicals, best known for co-creating The Book of Mormon and Avenue Q, and for co-writing the songs featured in the Disney computer-animated films Frozen, its sequel, Frozen II, and Coco, with his wife Kristen Anderson-Lopez. Of only seventeen people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony Award, nicknamed by Philip Michael Thomas in 1984 as the \"EGOT\", he is the youngest (at 39 years & 8 days old) and quickest (10 years) to win all four, and, as of 2022, is the only person to have won all four awards more than once (Emmy (3), Grammy (3), Oscar (2) and Tony (3))." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Lopez> .

A significant contributor to grime music, Kano is widely considered one of the pioneers of grime music and culture, alongside artists such as Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. In 2004, Kano released his debut single \"Ps and Qs\", which was an underground hit within the grime community. Kano's London Town (2007) featured his highest-charting single \"This is the Girl\" featuring Craig David. After signing to Parlophone, (a record label his cousin Dillon Smith is a member of) and six years without a studio release, Kano released his fifth album Made in the Manor (2016), Kano's most successful album to date. It was critically acclaimed by music critics and charted at number eight in the UK Albums Chart, becoming Kano's highest-charting release, as well as being considered one of the best albums of 2016 by numerous publications. It was shortlisted for the 2016 Mercury Prize and won Best Album at the 2016 MOBO Awards. He is also known for his acting, most notably playing the role of Sully in Top Boy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kano_(British_musician)> .

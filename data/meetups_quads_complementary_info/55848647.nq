<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Avenatti> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael John Avenatti (born February 16, 1971) is an American former attorney and convicted felon, best known for his legal representation and defrauding of adult film actress Stormy Daniels in unsuccessful lawsuits against then U.S. president Donald Trump, and for his attempted extortion of sports apparel company Nike that led to his conviction for several felonies. His firm had represented celebrity defendants and has filed suits against Fortune 500 companies. Avenatti has appeared extensively on television and in print as a legal and political commentator, and as a representative for prominent clients. Before Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed, Avenatti introduced a written declaration in September 2018 accusing Kavanaugh of spiking drinks at parties when he was in high school. The accuser, Julie Swetnick, later repudiated the declaration in an interview with NBC News, claiming Avenatti had misrepresented her allegations. Chuck Grassley referred Avenatti and Swetnick to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation. Beginning in March 2019, Avenatti was indicted in California and New York on different federal criminal counts including tax evasion, extortion, fraud, and embezzlement. On February 14, 2020, Avenatti was convicted of all charges against him in the New York court. He has been ineligible to practice law in California since May 4, 2020. On July 8, 2021, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. The second of four federal criminal trials involving Avenatti began on July 21, 2021 in Los Angeles, California with Avenatti defending himself. He was found guilty of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. On June 2, 2022, he was sentenced to four years in prison for defrauding Daniels. On December 5, 2022, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for wire fraud and obstruction against the Internal Revenue Service." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Avenatti> .

Considered a shock jock, his career has been well known for controversy and clashes with the Federal Communications Commission. He is best known for Mancow's Morning Madhouse, a Chicago-based syndicated radio show, and The Mancow Radio Experience, which have been nationally distributed by Talk Radio Network. Muller also co-starred with his brother, Mark, in the reality TV series God, Guns & Automobiles, which aired on History Channel. He was the host of the morning show on WLUP-FM/97.9, before he was let go on March 6, 2018 upon WLUP-FM/97.9 being sold. In January 2019, Muller returned to radio on WLS to host mornings, but has since been replaced." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mancow_Muller> .

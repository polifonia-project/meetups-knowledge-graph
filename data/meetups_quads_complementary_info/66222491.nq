His interest in music began as a child when he sang for private gatherings and for All India Radio. He became involved in the Indian People's Theatre Association when he moved to Mumbai as an adult and began to direct music for dramas. His first credit was for composing music for the film Panchayat (1958), and subsequent films included Bindiya (1960), Love in Simla (1960), Banarsi Thug (1962) and then Yeh Dil Kisko Doon (1963). His compositions have included music for songs sung by Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, Mahendra Kapoor, and three Mangeshkar sisters; Lata, Asha and Usha.

His later work included composing the music in Alam Ara (1973), the remake of the first Indian talkie film Alam Ara (1931)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iqbal_Qureshi> .

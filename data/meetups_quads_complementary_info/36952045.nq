<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calvin_Abueva> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Calvin Abueva (born February 4, 1988) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the Magnolia Hotshots of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He was picked second overall by the Alaska Aces during the 2012 PBA Draft. He was nicknamed \"The Beast\" due to the all-around threat he brings at both ends of the court, he dominated the nation's collegiate ranks by posting excellent numbers during his tenure with the San Sebastian College â€“ Recoletos Stags in the NCAA. He also became the first player in collegiate basketball history to lead a college league in points,rebounds, and assists. Due to his versatility, him being frequently listed between 6'2 or 6'3, and his position as an undersized power forward for the Aces, Abueva has been frequently compared to the legendary import Sean Chambers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calvin_Abueva> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denny_McLain> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dennis Dale McLain (born March 29, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player. He played for ten seasons in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher, most prominently as a member of the Detroit Tigers. In 1968, McLain became the last Major League Baseball pitcher to win 30 or more games during a season (with a record of 31–6) — a feat accomplished by only 11 players in the 20th century. As a player, McLain was brash and outspoken, sometimes creating controversy by criticizing teammates and fans with little provocation. His stellar performance at the beginning of his major league career included two Cy Young awards and an American League MVP award. His success in baseball stood in marked contrast to his personal life; he associated with organized crime and was eventually convicted on charges of embezzlement, for which he served time in prison." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denny_McLain> .

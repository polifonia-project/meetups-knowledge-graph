He is best known for his music, which often portrays an \"island escapism\" lifestyle. Together with his Coral Reefer Band, Buffett has recorded hit songs including \"Margaritaville\" (ranked 234th on the Recording Industry Association of America's list of \"Songs of the Century\") and \"Come Monday\". He has a devoted base of fans known as \"Parrotheads\". Aside from his career in music, Buffett is also a bestselling author and was involved in two restaurant chains named after two of his best-known songs; he currently owns the Margaritaville Cafe restaurant chain and co-developed the now defunct Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant chain. Buffett is one of the world's richest musicians, with a net worth as of 2017 of $900 million." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Buffett> .

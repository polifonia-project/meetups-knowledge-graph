He was a recipient of the 2013 Anchor Award from the University of Hartford's Alumni Association. Lopes received his BA and MA from the University of Hartford in Connecticut. After teaching in the Hartford school system devising a photographic program to promote reading and writing skills, he joined Richard Benson's studio in Newport, Rhode Island, in the 1970s. There, exhibitions and edition portfolios were produced from images by Paul Strand and Edward Weston. Later, Lopes continued the printing business on his own and specialized in the archival 19th century technique of platinum prints, developing his own style of hand-coated prints." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sal_Lopes> .

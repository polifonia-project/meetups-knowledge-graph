<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincenta_Da_Ponte> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vincenta da Ponte (fl. second half of the 18th century) was an Italian composer, singer and instrumentalist. She was a member of the coro, or music school, of Venice's Ospedale della Pietà during the tenure of it:Bonaventura Furlanetto as music director. Her origins are unknown, but her surname indicates that she was a member of a patrician family and not a foundling, as were most of the Ospidale's students; consequently, she would have been a tuition-paying student, or would have been awarded a scholarship. As a composer, Da Ponte is known only from an unpublished set of four dances included in a collection of and composed around 1775; the manuscript is held in the Conservatorio di Musica Benedetto Marcello in Venice. Da Ponte is one of five composers known to have emerged from the coro of the Ospedale; the others include Anna Bon and the foundlings Agata, Michielina, and Santa della Pietà." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincenta_Da_Ponte> .

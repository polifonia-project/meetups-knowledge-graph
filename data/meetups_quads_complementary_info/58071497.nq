<http://dbpedia.org/resource/YNW_Melly> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jamell Maurice Demons (born May 1, 1999), known professionally as YNW Melly (initialism for Young Nigga World Melly), is an American rapper and singer. He is best known for his songs \"Murder on My Mind\", \"Mixed Personalities\" (featuring Kanye West), \"Suicidal\" (featuring Juice Wrld), and \"223's\" (featuring 9lokkNine). The first is considered his breakout, which garnered him further attention after being charged with the double-murder of two fellow rappers in the \"YNW\" collective. In November 2019, he released his debut album, Melly vs. Melvin, peaking number 8 on the Billboard 200. In February 2019, he was arrested and charged with two counts of premeditated first-degree murder and faces life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if convicted. He is also a suspect in the 2017 murder of a sheriff's deputy in Gifford. In March 2019, Demons pleaded not guilty to the double-murder charges and is currently awaiting trial." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/YNW_Melly> .

A graduate of the Hanoi Conservatory, he has penned over 60 works, primarily for film and theatre. In 2001 he won the Vietnam National Film Award Best Music for The Season of Guavas. Then he subsequently won the Best Music prize in 2005 at the 8th Shanghai International Film Festival for his work on Hồ Quang Minh's film Thời xa vắng (\"A Far Time Past\") based on the novel of the same name by Lê Lựu. Đặng is best known as a composer of symphonies and orchestral music, combining this traditional European style of music with elements of traditional Vietnamese music, such as Nhạc dân tộc cải biên. He is also noted in Vietnam for his instrumental music such as piano sonatas." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Đặng_Hữu_Phúc> .

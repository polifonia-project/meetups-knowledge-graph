<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eldon_Hoke> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eldon Wayne Hoke (March 23, 1958 â€“ April 19, 1997), nicknamed El Duce, was an American musician best known as the drummer and lead singer of the shock rock band the Mentors, as well as other acts, including Chinas Comidas and the Screamers. Apart from his musical career, Eldon was also an actor who appeared in several films as an extra, and discussed his hugely-controversial band and lifestyle on the notorious Jerry Springer and Wally George TV talk-shows. Today El Duce is remembered as a cultural pioneer who, using his dark sense of humor, destroyed taboos in rock music regarding onstage speech and behavior, and who set a precedent for today's most outrageous and extreme musical acts. The Mentors' songs were covered by artists including Frank Zappa, Black Label Society, GWAR and Koffin Kats, and quoted by Guns N' Roses, Anthrax and Dr. Know (in \"Cornshucker\", \"I'm The Man\" and \"Fist F*ck\", respectively)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eldon_Hoke> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Academy_maniacs> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Artyom Alexandrovich Anoufriev (Russian: Артём Александрович Ануфриев; 4 October 1992) and Nikita Vakhtangovich Lytkin (Russian: Никита Вахтангович Лыткин; 24 March 1993 – 30 November 2021) are two serial killers from Irkutsk, Russia, known as the \"Academy maniacs\" and the \"Irkutsk Molotochniki\". The pair collectively committed six murders and injured nine others in a series of attacks that took place in Irkutsk Academgorodok between December 2010 and April 2011, while still teenagers. Both perpetrators were detained in April 2011, and were collectively charged with murder, robbery, abuse of victims' bodies and organizing extremist activities. The judicial investigation of the case lasted from August 2012 to February 2013. On 2 April 2013, the Irkutsk Regional Court sentenced Anoufriev to life imprisonment, and Lytkin to 24 years imprisonment. On 3 October 2013, the Supreme Court of Russia finalized the verdict of Anoufriev's life sentence, while Lytkin's sentence was reduced to 20 years imprisonment. The case is noteworthy for the fact that it was the first ever time that a case concerning violent extremism in the Irkutsk Oblast was solved using forensic science." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Academy_maniacs> .

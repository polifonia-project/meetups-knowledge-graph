<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Jones_(rapper)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joseph Guillermo Jones II (born July 15, 1976), better known by his stage name Jim Jones (formerly Jimmy Jones), is an American rapper, music video director, and record executive. He is an original member of the hip hop collective the Diplomats (also known as Dipset), alongside longtime friend and fellow Harlem native, Cam'ron. In 2004, he released his debut solo album On My Way to Church. The release of his second album, Harlem: Diary of a Summer in 2005, coincided with Jones landing an executive position in A&R at Entertainment One Music. A year later he was on his third album Hustler's P.O.M.E. (Product of My Environment) (2006), which spawned his biggest single to date, \"We Fly High\". The song reached number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Jones' first major-label album Pray IV Reign was released in March 2009 by Columbia Records. The album spawned the hit single \"Pop Champagne\" (with Ron Browz featuring Juelz Santana). In April 2011, Jones released his fifth album, Capo, which was supported by the lead single, \"Perfect Day\" (featuring Chink Santana). He returned in May 2019, for his sixth album titled El Capo." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Jones_(rapper)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moe_Tucker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Maureen Ann \"Moe\" Tucker (born August 26, 1944) is an American musician and singer-songwriter who was the drummer for the New York City-based rock band the Velvet Underground. After they disbanded in the early 1970s, she left the music industry for a while, though her music career restarted in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s. She has released four solo albums, where she played most of the instruments herself (though with frequent guest appearances by her former Velvet Underground bandmates and others), and has periodically toured. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a member of the Velvet Underground." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moe_Tucker> .

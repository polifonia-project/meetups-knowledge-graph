<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anita_Bryant> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anita Jane Bryant (born March 25, 1940) is an American singer known for anti-gay activism. She scored four \"Top 40\" hits in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including \"Paper Roses\" which reached No. 5 on the charts. She was the 1958 Miss Oklahoma beauty pageant winner, and a brand ambassador from 1969 to 1980 for the Florida Citrus Commission. In the 1970s, Bryant became known as an outspoken opponent of gay rights in the U.S. In 1977, she ran the \"Save Our Children\" campaign to repeal a local ordinance in Miami-Dade County, Florida, that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Her involvement with the campaign was condemned by gay rights activists. They were assisted by many other prominent figures in music, film, and television, and retaliated by boycotting the orange juice that she promoted. Though the campaign ended successfully with a 69% majority vote to repeal the ordinance on June 7, 1977 (Dade County restored the ordinance in 1998), it permanently damaged her public image, and her contract with the Florida Citrus Commission was terminated three years later. This, as well as her later divorce from Bob Green, damaged her financially. Bryant never regained her former prominence and filed for bankruptcy twice. She lives in her home state of Oklahoma." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anita_Bryant> .

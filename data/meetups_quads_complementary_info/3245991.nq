<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jaz_Coleman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeremy \"Jaz\" Coleman (born 26 February 1960) is an English singer and musician. He came to prominence in the early 1980s as the lead vocalist and keyboardist of post-punk group Killing Joke. Coleman is known for his unique raspy baritone voice and intense stage presence (occasionally appearing wearing face makeup). Bill Janovitz, writer for the website Allmusic, described Coleman's stage presence and voice as \"almost always full-on in his approach, with a terrifying growl of a voice that is similar to that of Mot√∂rhead's Lemmy\". In the first part of their career, Coleman also played synth while singing, adding electronic atonal sounds to create a disturbing atmosphere to their music. He still continues to play keyboards and synths in studio recordings In addition, Coleman has composed orchestral and soundtrack pieces. Killing Joke have influenced numerous bands such as Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Jane's Addiction, My Bloody Valentine, Faith No More, Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Godflesh, Soundgarden, Metallica and Marilyn Manson. James Hetfield picked Coleman as one of his favourite singers.In November 2010, the band received the \"Innovator Award\" at the 2010 Classic Rock Roll of Honour; the award was presented to Killing Joke by admirer and friend Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, who stated, \"I go back a long way with Jaz Coleman and the band. I used to go and see the band, and it was a band that really impressed me.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jaz_Coleman> .

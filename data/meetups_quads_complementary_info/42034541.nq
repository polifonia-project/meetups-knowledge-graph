<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caryl_Churchill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Caryl Lesley Churchill (born 3 September 1938) is a British playwright known for dramatising the abuses of power, for her use of non-naturalistic techniques, and for her exploration of sexual politics and feminist themes. Celebrated for works such as Cloud 9 (1979), Top Girls (1982), Serious Money (1987), Blue Heart (1997), Far Away (2000), and A Number (2002), she has been described as \"one of Britain's greatest poets and innovators for the contemporary stage\". In a 2011 dramatists' poll by The Village Voice, five out of the 20 polled writers listed Churchill as the greatest living playwright." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caryl_Churchill> .

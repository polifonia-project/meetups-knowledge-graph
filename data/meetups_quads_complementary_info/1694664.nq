<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jennifer_Armstrong> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jennifer Mary Armstrong (born May 19, 1961) is an American children's writer known for both fiction and non-fiction. She was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, grew up outside of New York City, and now lives in Saratoga Springs, New York. She was formerly married to the author James Howard Kunstler. As an author who has utilized multiple types of narrative structures, Armstrong believes that A short story is only one of many narrative structures. We create narrative with jokes, ballads, tales, novels, poems, anecdotes, etc... While there are many satisfactions to be found in the conventional beginning-middle-end narrative that is common in short fiction for kids, I believe young readers can respond to many other forms of short narrative. After 9/11, she wrote that books can be the \"enemy of violent zealotry\" and work against chaos and fear." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jennifer_Armstrong> .

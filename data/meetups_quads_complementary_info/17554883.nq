She has also directed a few TV series, which aired on ABS-CBN, where she is one of the resident directors. Her films have frequently become some of the highest-grossing films in the Philippines. Her 2019 film, Hello, Love, Goodbye, starring Kathryn Bernardo and Alden Richards, became the highest grossing Philippine film of all time. The film displaced Garcia-Molina's other film The Hows of Us (2018), which used to hold the record, and which is now the 2nd highest grossing Filipino film of all time." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathy_Garcia-Molina> .

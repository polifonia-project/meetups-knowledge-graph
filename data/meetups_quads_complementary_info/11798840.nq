Before joining Philippine showbiz, Bonnevie was first runner-up in the Miss Magnolia 1979 Beauty Contest. She landed her first acting assignment in the campy Temptation Island in 1980 with Joey Gosiengfiao at the helm. However, the following year, Regal Films launched her to lead star status via Joey Gosingfiao's Katorse opposite then boyfriend, Alfie Anido. The same film introduced a young Gabby Concepcion who essayed the role of a naughty brat of a man. In 1981, while doing Age Doesn't Matter with fellow Regal babies, Maricel Soriano and Snooky Serna and the wacky Tito, Vic & Joey, she fell in love with Vic Sotto. The following years, she went into semi-retirement by focusing on her domestic life, but seen on television via the sitcom 2 + 2 = Gulo with then husband, Vic Sotto and supported by Maricel Soriano and William Martinez, plus a young Herbert Bautista. In 1985, Viva Films assigned her the role of a young disturbed woman via Tinik sa Dibdib with Nora Aunor in the lead. She took home the FAMAS and FAP best-supporting actress statuettes. In 1986 she snagged her string of best actress trophies from the CMMA, FAMAS and FAP for Magdusa Ka!. In the said movie, she essayed the role of Christine, a young woman disowned by her mother, Toyang (Nida Blanca) after getting impregnated by boyfriend, Rod (Christopher de Leon). She ran away from Rod after frequent misunderstandings with her drunkard mother-in-law, Metring (Perla Bautista). She sought refuge from her rich but lameduck father, Bernardo (Dindo Fernando) but is sent away by her aristocratic grandmother Doña Perla (Armida Siguion Reyna). She asked the help of her best friend Violy (Jobelle Salvador) but was mistreated by the latter's mother (Angie Ferro). Christine after all the tribulations managed to stand up and healing followed. Her Viva Films assignments were Sana'y Wala ng Wakas (1986), Alabok sa Ulap (1987), Ang Lahat ng Ito, Pati ang Langit (1989), Ang Babaing Nawawala sa Sarili (1990); Kung Kasalanan Man (1990), Gumapang Ka sa Lusak (1990) among others.

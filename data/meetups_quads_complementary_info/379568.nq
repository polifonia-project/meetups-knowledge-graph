<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_Schultz> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dutch Schultz (born Arthur Simon Flegenheimer; August 6, 1901 â€“ October 24, 1935) was an American mobster. Based in New York City in the 1920s and 1930s, he made his fortune in organized crime-related activities, including bootlegging and the numbers racket. Weakened by two tax evasion trials led by prosecutor Thomas Dewey, Schultz's rackets were also threatened by fellow mobster Lucky Luciano. In an attempt to avert his conviction, Schultz asked the Commission for permission to kill Dewey, which they refused. When Schultz disobeyed them and made an attempt to kill Dewey, the Commission ordered his murder in 1935." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_Schultz> .

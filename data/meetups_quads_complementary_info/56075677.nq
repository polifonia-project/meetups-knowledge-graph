<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregg_Latterman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gregg Latterman is an American entrepreneur, academic, and angel investor. The founder of Aware Records, he teaches \"Positive Entrepreneurship: Profits and Meaning\" at Northwestern University, and lectures on innovation and entrepreneurship at the Kellogg School of Management. A passionate music fan, Latterman put together a compilation CD of his favorite unsigned bands in 1993. He released it on his own label, and quit his job as a CPA on the day it came out. The label, Aware, became \"one of the most durable and influential independent forces in music,\" with Latterman helping to launch the careers of artists including John Mayer, Train, Mat Kearney, Hootie & The Blowfish, and Five For Fighting. In 2012, after more than 25 million records were sold on Aware, Latterman decided to return to school. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, and earned a master's degree in positive psychology under Martin Seligman. In 2014 he began teaching at Northwestern, where his classes examine work ethics, talent, and entrepreneurial drive, and encourage students to integrate their passions and values into their professions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregg_Latterman> .

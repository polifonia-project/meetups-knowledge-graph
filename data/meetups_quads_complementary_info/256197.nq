<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henrik_Shipstead> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Henrik Shipstead (January 8, 1881 â€“ June 26, 1960) was an American politician. He served in the United States Senate from 1923 to 1947, from the state of Minnesota. He served first as a member of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party from 1923 to 1941 and then as a Republican from 1941 to 1947. Few members of Congress in American history were more consistent in opposing US foreign interventionism. Shipstead was born on a farm in Kandiyohi County, Minnesota, in 1881 to Norwegian immigrant parents. In the early 20th century, he set up a dental practice and was elected president of the village council of Glenwood in neighboring Pope County." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henrik_Shipstead> .

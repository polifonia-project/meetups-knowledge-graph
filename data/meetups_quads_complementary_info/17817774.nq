<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Capps> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bobby Capps is an American rock keyboardist. He graduated from high school in DeWitt, Arkansas, on May 26, 1985. Capps is best known for being a member of the southern rock band 38 Special since 1988. He played with them between 1988 and 1991 then came on board in 1991 and became a full-time member later in the 1990s. The band, which started as a Southern rock band and switched to a more straight-ahead rock sound, had several hit singles between 1979 and 1991. Capps continues to tour with 38 Special and recently had a release of the single \"In the Blink of an Eye\" about NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt winning and then losing his life in an accident." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Capps> .

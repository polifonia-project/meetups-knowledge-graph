She had only one major hit, \"With All My Heart\", an English cover version of \"Gondolier\", which reached No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1957. Her other recording \"Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)\" barely made the Top 100 chart the following year, reaching No. 95, but did better in the United Kingdom where it reached No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart. She also appeared in the 1957 film Jamboree." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jodie_Sands> .

Now in his fifth Senate term, Durbin has held his seat since 1997. Durbin has been Senate Democratic whip since 2005, the second-highest position in the Democratic leadership in the Senate, and Senate majority whip since 2021. He chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. Durbin led the Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination hearings. Durbin was born in East St. Louis, Illinois. He graduated from the School of Foreign Service and Georgetown University Law Center. Working in state legal counsel throughout the 1970s, he made an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor of Illinois in 1978.

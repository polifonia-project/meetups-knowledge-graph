<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Konesky> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John S. Konesky (born November 19, 1980) is an American guitarist and record producer, best known for his role as the lead electric guitar player for Tenacious D. Konesky was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, where he performed in a band with friend John Spiker. Through a mutual friend, he and Spiker met Tenacious D guitarist Kyle Gass, who was recruiting musicians for his Trainwreck project. In 2003, Konesky relocated to Los Angeles to become the electric guitarist for Trainwreck. In 2005, Konesky and Spiker performed on the second Tenacious D album The Pick of Destiny and would then perform live on The Pick of Destiny Tour, making them (alongside drummer Brooks Wackerman) additional live members of Tenacious D. In 2010, Trainwreck split up, which lead him and Gass to form Kyle Gass Band. In 2012, Konesky formed country band Wynchester alongside Kyle Gass Band lead vocalist, Mike Bray, whom released their debut record in 2018. In 2009, Konesky and Gass worked together on the YouTube channel Guitarings. Konesky was a member of Tenacious D when the band won a Grammy in 2015 for their cover of Dio's \"The Last in Line\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Konesky> .

He won three Golden Guitar Awards and wrote more than 500 songs in his 50-year music career. Lindsay recorded over 65 albums and 250 singles. Reg made his first trip to Nashville in June 1968 and recorded his first Nashville EP on this historic trip. Lindsay's most popular cross-over hit was a cover version, \"Armstrong\" (March 1971), which reached No. 6 on the Go-Set National Top 60. It was written and originally performed by the American folk musician John Stewart as a tribute to Neil Armstrong's lunar landing in 1969." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reg_Lindsay> .

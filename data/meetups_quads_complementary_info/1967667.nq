<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kahimi_Karie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mari Hiki (比企マリ, Hiki Mari, born March 15, 1968), better known by her stage name Kahimi Karie (カヒミ・カリィ, Kahimi Karii), is a Japanese singer, songwriter and photographer. Her music is closely associated with the Shibuya-kei aesthetic. Karie sings in English, French and Japanese, among other languages. Karie began her music career in 1990 at the encouragement of fellow Shibuya-kei artist Cornelius, whom she collaborated with on many of her early works, and whose trendy Trattoria label released many of her EPs in the mid-1990s. Karie later moved to Paris and released several studio albums on the Crue-L and Polydor labels. She now lives in New York City." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kahimi_Karie> .

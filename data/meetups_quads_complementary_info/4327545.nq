<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shin_Jung-hyeon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shin Jung-hyeon (Korean: 신중현; Hanja: 申重鉉, pronounced [ɕind͡ʑuŋçʌn] or [ɕin] [t͡ɕuŋçʌn]; born January 4, 1938), also transliterated as Shin Joong-hyun or Sin Junghyeon, is a South Korean rock guitarist and singer-songwriter often referred to as Korea's \"Godfather of Rock.\" A pioneer of Korean rock music, Shin is known for forming South Korea's first rock band, Add4, in 1962 and for being at the forefront of the country's psychedelic rock scene of the 1960s and 1970s. He wrote his most famous song, \"Beautiful Rivers and Mountains,\" in protest of the military dictatorship of Park Chung-hee in 1972. Shin was later imprisoned and tortured by Park's regime, and his music was banned until the 1980s. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1990s and has since received numerous accolades recognizing his contributions to South Korean popular music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shin_Jung-hyeon> .

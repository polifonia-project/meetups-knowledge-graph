Initially critical of United States President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, Owens has been recognized in part for her pro-Trump activism as a black woman, in addition to her criticism of Black Lives Matter and the Democratic Party. On several occasions she has claimed that the effects of white supremacy and nationalism are exaggerated, especially when compared to other issues facing Black Americans. She worked for the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA between 2017 and 2019 as its communications director. In 2021, she joined The Daily Wire, where she hosts Candace, a political talk show. Owens has promoted conspiracy theories, mostly through her social media profiles and television & media appearances. She has expressed anti-lockdown views and anti-vaccination opinions during the COVID-19 pandemic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Candace_Owens> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Hutson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Donald Montgomery Hutson (January 31, 1913 â€“ June 26, 1997) was an American professional football player and assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL). He played as an end and spent his entire 11-year professional career with the Green Bay Packers. Under head coach Curly Lambeau, Hutson led the Packers to four NFL Championship Games, winning three: 1936, 1939, and 1944. Hutson joined the Packers in 1935 and played 11 seasons before he retired in 1945. He led the league in receiving yards in seven separate seasons and in receiving touchdowns in nine. A talented safety on defense, he also led the NFL in interceptions in 1940. Hutson was an eight-time All-Pro selection, a four-time All-Star, and was twice awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy as the NFL Most Valuable Player. Hutson is considered to have been the first modern wide receiver, and is credited with creating many of the modern pass routes used in the NFL today. He was the dominant receiver of his day, and is widely considered one of the greatest receivers in NFL history. Hutson was the first 1,000 yard receiver in the NFL. He held almost all major receiving records at the time of his retirement, including career receptions, yards, and touchdowns. He was inducted as a charter member of both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Hutson's number 14 was the first jersey retired by the Packers, and he is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. Hutson was selected to the National Football League 50th Anniversary All-Time Team as one of the greatest players of the NFL's first 50 years in 1969, to the 75th in 1994, and to the 100th in 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Hutson> .

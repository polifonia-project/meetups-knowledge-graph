<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Hall_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Faye \"Roy\" Hall (May 7, 1922 â€“ March 3, 1984), also known by his pseudonym \"Sunny David\", was an American rockabilly pianist and songwriter. Hall was an uncredited co-writer of the rockabilly classic \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\", a song recorded by Hall himself and later popularized by Jerry Lee Lewis. Although his writing claim was initially disputed, later reissues of the song credit Hall for his role in its conception." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Hall_(musician)> .

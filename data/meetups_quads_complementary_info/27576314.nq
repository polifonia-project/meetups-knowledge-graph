<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricky_Allen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard A. Allen (January 6, 1935 – May 29, 2005) was an American blues singer from Chicago. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and began his singing career as a member of a church choir in his home town. He relocated to Chicago in 1960, and received a recording contract one year later at Age Records. He had a local hit with \"You Better Be Sure\" and, in 1963, his hit \"Cut You A-Loose\" reached Number 20 in Billboard's R&B chart. Some of his recordings of the 1960s, such as \"It's A Mess I Tell You\" and \"I Can't Stand No Signifying\", portended the emerging soul-blues style of the 1970s. After his retirement from the music industry in the early 1970s, he ran a laundry and a limousine service. In 2001, he performed at the Mönsterås Festival in Sweden, and the following year at the Chicago Blues Festival. He died in 2005, aged 70." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricky_Allen> .

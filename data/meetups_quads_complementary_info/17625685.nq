Initially, he was a member of the band Bandana, in which he charted several singles on the Hot Country Songs charts in the 1980s. After leaving Bandana, Menzies began a solo career on Columbia Records in 1990, releasing his debut album Stone by Stone that year. A second album, This Ol' Heart, followed in 1992 on Giant Records. Overall, these two albums produced six singles for Menzies on the country charts as well. In addition to his work as a musician, Menzies has written songs for several artists, including Mark Chesnutt, Shelby Lynne, Trisha Yearwood, and Reba McEntire." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Menzies> .

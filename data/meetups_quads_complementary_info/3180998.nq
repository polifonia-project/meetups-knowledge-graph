<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Gauthier> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Veronica Gauthier (/ˈɡoʊʃeɪ/ GOH-shay; born March 11, 1962) is a Grammy-nominated American folk singer-songwriter and author, whose songs have been covered by performers including Tim McGraw, Blake Shelton, Kathy Mattea,Boy George and Jimmy Buffett. She has won multiple awards, including at the International Folk Music Awards, the Independent Music Awards, and from the Americana Association. Mary's songs often deal with marginalization, informed by her experience of addiction and recovery, and growing up gay, and demonstrate an \"ability to transform her own trauma into a purposeful and communal narrative\". Her 2018 album Rifles & Rosary Beads, co-written with military veterans and their families, has been hailed as a landmark achievement." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Gauthier> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ol'_Dirty_Bastard> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Russell Tyrone Jones (November 15, 1968 â€“ November 13, 2004), better known by his stage name Ol' Dirty Bastard (often abbreviated as ODB), was an American rapper. He was one of the founding members of the Wu-Tang Clan, a rap group primarily from Staten Island, New York City, which rose to mainstream prominence with its 1993 debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). His professional success was hampered by frequent legal troubles, including incarceration. He died on November 13, 2004, of an accidental drug overdose, two days before his 36th birthday. Ol' Dirty Bastard was noted for his \"outrageously profane, free-associative rhymes delivered in a distinctive half-rapped, half-sung style\". His stage name was derived from the 1980 Chinese martial arts film Ol' Dirty and the Bastard (also called An Old Kung Fu Master, starring Yuen Siu-tien). According to fellow Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man, Ol' Dirty Bastard's name was also a reference to the unique nature of his rapping and, specifically, the fact \"there ain't no father to his style.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ol'_Dirty_Bastard> .

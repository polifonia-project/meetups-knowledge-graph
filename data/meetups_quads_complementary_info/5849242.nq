<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anastasia_Rodionova> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anastasia Ivanovna Rodionova (Russian: Анастасия Ивановна Родионова; born 12 May 1982) is a Russian-born Australian professional tennis player. Rodionova has won 11 doubles titles on the WTA Tour, as well as eight singles and 13 doubles titles on the ITF Circuit. On 16 August 2010, she reached her career-high singles ranking of world No. 62. On 8 September 2014, she peaked at No. 15 in the doubles rankings. Her greatest career achievements have come in doubles, having reached the finals of the mixed-doubles event at the 2003 Wimbledon Championships with Andy Ram and the semifinals of the women's doubles event at the 2010 US Open with Cara Black. Rodionova suffers the ignominious distinction of being one of just two players in WTA history to be defaulted from a tournament, after hitting a ball towards spectators at the 2007 Western & Southern Open. Her younger sister Arina is also a tennis professional, and the two sisters have intermittently contested doubles tournaments together, with modest success. Their most notable achievements as a team came at the 2010 Malaysian Open and 2015 Monterrey Open, succumbing in the super tie-break in the finals of both tournaments." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anastasia_Rodionova> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Playa_Fly> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Playa Fly (born Ibn Young on September 2, 1977) is an American rapper from Memphis, Tennessee. Fly was a member of the Three 6 Mafia (then known as Lil' Fly), but he stopped collaborating in 1995 due to monetary disputes and philosophical differences after recording one album under the group's guidance. Pursuing a solo career as Playa Fly, he released one independent album before signing a three-album contract with Super Sigg Records. During that period he had many underground hits, perhaps the most famous being \"Nobody Needs Nobody\". Fly's early hit immediately gained notoriety from the song \"Triple Bitch Mafia\", which lashed out against his former group." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Playa_Fly> .

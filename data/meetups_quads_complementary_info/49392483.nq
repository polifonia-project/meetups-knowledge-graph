<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monteco> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Monteco Turner (born September 16, 1978), known mononymously as Monteco, is an American contemporary R&B singer who was active in the mid 1990s. His first single \"Is It Me?\" was released in 1995, and features fellow contemporary R&B group IMx (then known as Immature). The song peaked at #32 on the Billboard R&B chart, but Monteco's album to promote the single, Soulschool, failed to chart. Monteco released his eponymous second album independently in 1997; it also failed to chart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monteco> .

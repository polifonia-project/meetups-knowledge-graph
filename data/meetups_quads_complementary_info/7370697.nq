<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margo_Guryan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Margo Guryan (September 20, 1937 â€“ November 8, 2021) was an American songwriter, singer, musician and lyricist. As a songwriter, her work was first recorded in 1958, although it was for her 1960s song \"Sunday Mornin'\", a hit for both Spanky and Our Gang and Oliver, that she is perhaps best known. Her songs have also been recorded by Cass Elliot, Glen Campbell and Astrud Gilberto, among others. As a performer, she is best known for her 1968 album Take a Picture, the sole album release in the initial phase of her career. The album was re-released in 2000, and followed by a compilation entitled 25 Demos (2001). In 2014 the American record label Burger Records released another compilation named 27 Demos on cassette." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margo_Guryan> .

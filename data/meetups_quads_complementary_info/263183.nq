At the height of his success in 1990, he was described as being \"the most successful, influential and powerful theatrical producer in the world\" by the New York Times. He is the producer of shows including Les Misérables, The Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Miss Saigon, Mary Poppins, Oliver!, and Hamilton. Mackintosh was knighted in 1996 for services to musical theatre. Two of his productions, Les Misérables and The Phantom of the Opera, are the two longest-running musicals in West End history. In 2008, The Daily Telegraph ranked him number 7 in their list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\". In the Sunday Times Rich List of 2021, Mackintosh was estimated to have a net worth of £1.2 billion." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cameron_Mackintosh> .

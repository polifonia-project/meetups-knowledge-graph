<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_M._Sherman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Morton Sherman (born June 12, 1928) is an American songwriter who specialized in musical films with his brother Robert B. Sherman. According to the official Walt Disney Company website and independent fact checkers, \"the Sherman Brothers were responsible for more motion picture musical song scores than any other songwriting team in film history.\" Some of the Sherman Brothers' best known songs were incorporated into live action and animation musical films including: Mary Poppins, The Happiest Millionaire, The Jungle Book, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Snoopy Come Home, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Slipper and the Rose, and Charlotte's Web. Their most well known work, however, remains \"It's a Small World (After All)\", written for the theme park attraction of the same name. According to Time, it may be the most (publicly) performed song in history." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_M._Sherman> .

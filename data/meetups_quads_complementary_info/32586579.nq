<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyary_Pamyu_Pamyu> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kiriko Takemura (Japanese: 竹村 桐子, born January 29, 1993), known professionally as Kyary Pamyu Pamyu (Hiragana: きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ), is a Japanese tarento, singer, and model. Her public image is associated with Japan's kawaii and decora culture, centered in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. Kyary's music is produced by musician Yasutaka Nakata of electronic music duo Capsule. Her 2011 single \"PONPONPON\" reached the top ten on Japan's Oricon music chart; the 2012 singles \"Candy Candy\" and \"Fashion Monster\" followed this success. Kyary has since released five full-length albums: Pamyu Pamyu Revolution (2012), Nanda Collection (2013), Pika Pika Fantajin (2014), Japamyu (2018), and Candy Racer (2021). Though most of her success as a recording artist has been in Asia, she has also gained popularity in Western countries due in part to Internet videos which have gone viral. Media outlets have referred to Kyary as a \"Fashion Monster\", and she has been photographed for magazines such as Dazed & Confused. In 2013, she signed a distribution deal with Sire Records to release her material in the United States. As of February 2020, Kyary Pamyu Pamyu has sold over 970,000 physical albums and singles in Japan according to Oricon as well as over 2.25 million downloads of her singles." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kyary_Pamyu_Pamyu> .

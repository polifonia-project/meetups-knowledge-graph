<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darryl_Sittler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Darryl Glen Sittler (born September 18, 1950) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League from 1970 until 1985 for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Detroit Red Wings. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1989, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Canadian Walk of Fame in 2016. In 2017 Sittler was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. On February 7, 1976, Sittler set an NHL record for most points by an individual in one game when he made ten points (six goals and four assists) against the Boston Bruins - a record that still stands after more than forty-five years. He also remains the most recent NHL player to score six goals in one game." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darryl_Sittler> .

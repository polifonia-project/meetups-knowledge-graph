He is best known as the founder and leader of Alex Mendham & His Orchestra. Founding his orchestra in 2010, Mendham, who has been described as a very classic British gentleman with a flawless and sophisticated attire, has risen to become Britain's premier bandleader recreating the glamorous, romantic music of the 1920s and 1930s by replicating the authentic aura of every song using careful arrangements and instruments from the era. Performing in elegant attire from the Art Deco era, Alex and his Orchestra performed as the house band at London's luxurious Savoy Hotel, is frequently featured on BBC Radio and appeared on stage to sell out audiences in the UK, Europe and USA. He has been featured on the BBC and in journals including Forbes. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic that devastated the livelihoods of musicians, Mendham signed to Decca Records for a project celebrating the career of Dame Vera Lynn, entitled Keep Smiling Through and recorded his uplifting compilation of hot jazz standards and romantic songs, Puttin' on the Ritz." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Mendham> .

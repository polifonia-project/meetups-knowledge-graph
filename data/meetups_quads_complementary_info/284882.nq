<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Davies> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Russell Gordon Davies (born 3 February 1947) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the English rock band the Kinks, which also featured his elder brother Ray Davies. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a member of the Kinks. Davies is prolific with his innovative nature on the electric guitar, specifically in being one of the first to utilize electric guitar distortion and exposing the effect to the mainstream. His signature distorted power chord riffs on songs would heavily influence future heavy metal and punk rock acts. In 2003, Davies was ranked 91st in Rolling Stone Magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Davies> .

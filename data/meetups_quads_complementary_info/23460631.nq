He has released seven albums via Average Joes Entertainment, which he co-founded. Ford has charted six times on the Hot Country Songs charts and co-wrote (with Brantley Gilbert) \"Dirt Road Anthem\", a song on his 2008 album Ride Through the Country, which Jason Aldean later covered on his My Kinda Party album. Ford was the first, and so far only, artist to have a Number One album on Billboard Top Country Albums and Top Rap Albums." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colt_Ford> .

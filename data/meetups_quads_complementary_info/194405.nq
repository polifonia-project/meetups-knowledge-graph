<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oscar_Torp> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "(8 June 1893 â€“ 1 May 1958) was a Norwegian politician for the Norwegian Labour Party. He was party leader from 1923 to 1945, and mayor of Oslo in 1935 and 1936. In 1935 he became the acting minister of Defence in the government of Johan Nygaardsvold. He was also the minister of Social Affairs from 1936 to 1939, and then the minister of Finance from 1939 to 1942. He was appointed Minister of Defence again in 1942 in the London-based Norwegian exile government. He continued until the election in 1945 when he became the minister of Provisioning and Reconstruction until 1948. Hailing from Skjeberg, he was first elected to the Parliament of Norway representing Oslo in 1936, but did not take a seat in the Parliament until 1948. He then became the faction leader for the Labour Party in Parliament. He became the 23rd prime minister of Norway in 1951 when Einar Gerhardsen stepped down from this position; the move was reversed in 1955 when Torp became the president of the Storting. He held this position until his death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oscar_Torp> .

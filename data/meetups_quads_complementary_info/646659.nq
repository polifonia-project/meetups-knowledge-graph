He has been described as a gonzo journalist, becoming a faux-na√Øf character in his stories. He produces informal but sceptical investigations of controversial fringe politics and science. He has published nine books and his work has appeared in publications such as The Guardian, City Life and Time Out. He has made several BBC Television documentary films and two documentary series for Channel 4." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Ronson> .

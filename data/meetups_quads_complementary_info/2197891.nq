Freekey also serves as the owner/CEO of 730 Dips Records. Aside from The Diplomats, he is also a member of fellow rapper Jim Jones' ByrdGang, and has made a habit of yelling his name in songs; it is his signature on tracks, whether he is featured or the solo artist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freekey_Zekey> .

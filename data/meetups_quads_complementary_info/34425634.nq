<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Hunter_(golfer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Irvine Hunter (January 29, 1892 â€“ October 18, 1968) was a Scottish-American professional golfer. He won the British Amateur title in 1921, and immigrated to the United States later that year. Hunter became a prominent figure in California golf, winning several important titles, including six PGA Tour events, but played the Tour, such as it was at that time, only on an irregular basis, while holding down club jobs. He was the head professional at Riviera Country Club near Los Angeles, California from 1936 to 1964." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Hunter_(golfer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skye_Edwards> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Skye Edwards (born Shirley Klaris Yonavieve Edwards; 27 May 1974), sometimes simply Skye, is a British singer-songwriter. Her career began in 1994 when she and the Godfrey brothers (Paul Godfrey, a DJ, and Ross Godfrey, a multi-instrumentalist) formed the band Morcheeba, which released five albums with Skye as lead vocalist. In 2003, the band split, after which Skye released two solo albums: Mind How You Go in 2006, and Keeping Secrets in 2009. In 2010, Edwards returned to Morcheeba, again as lead vocalist. In 2012, she released her third solo album, Back to Now, while in 2015 she released her fourth one, In A Low Light. Edwards decided to shorten her name to Skye by taking the first letter of each of her names and putting them together. She is married to bass player Steve Gordon and they have four children. Edwards has sung on two charity collaborations: \"Perfect Day\" (1997, in aid of Children in Need) and Band Aid 20 (2004, in aid of famine relief in Sudan, Africa)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skye_Edwards> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene_Hoglan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eugene Victor Hoglan II (born August 31, 1967) is an American drummer, acclaimed for his creativity in drum arrangements, including use of abstract devices for percussion effects and his trademark lengthy double-kick drum rhythms. Though his playing style is very technically demanding, he retains high accuracy at extreme tempos, earning him the nicknames \"The Atomic Clock\" and \"Human Drum Machine\". He is best known for his work with Dark Angel, Death, Strapping Young Lad, Devin Townsend, Fear Factory, Dethklok and Testament. Hoglan completed work on Dethklok's fourth album The Doomstar Requiem, which was released in October 2013. He released the highly successful Gene Hoglan: The Atomic Clock DVD, and rejoined Testament to record the drum tracks for their eleventh album, Dark Roots of Earth, released in July 2012. Hoglan had since rejoined Testament permanently, and by the time he left the band again in January 2022, he was their longest serving drummer. Hoglan was featured on the cover of Modern Drummer magazine in November 2010. He also won Terrorizer magazine's Reader's Poll for Best Drummer 2010, and Modern Drummer magazine nominated Hoglan for Best Metal Drummer, and Best Recorded Performance (for Dethklok's Dethalbum II) on their 2011 ballot. He was nominated for Best Drummer in Revolver magazine's 2010 Reader's Poll." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene_Hoglan> .

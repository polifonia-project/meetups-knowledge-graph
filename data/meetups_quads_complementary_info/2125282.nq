<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trevor_Bailey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Trevor Edward Bailey CBE (3 December 1923 â€“ 10 February 2011) was an England Test cricketer, cricket writer and broadcaster. An all-rounder, Bailey was known for his skilful but unspectacular batting. As the BBC reflected in his obituary: \"His stubborn refusal to be out normally brought more pleasure to the team than to the spectators.\" This defensive style of play brought him the first of his nicknames, \"Barnacle Bailey\", but he was a good enough cricketer to be retrospectively judged as the leading all-rounder in the world for most of his international career. In later life, Bailey wrote a number of books and commentated on the game. He was particularly known for the 26 years he spent working for the BBC on the Test Match Special radio programme." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trevor_Bailey> .

She is best known for her 2019 feature film debut Honey Boy, for which she won a Directors Guild of America Award. Her 2011 documentary Bombay Beach, which took the top prize at Tribeca Film Festival, received a nomination for an Independent Spirit Award. In 2016, her documentary LoveTrue won the Grand Prix Best Documentary Award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The same year, Har'el was named one of the \"Top 12 female filmmakers ready to direct a blockbuster\" by IndieWire. Har'el is noted for her ability to artistically blur the lines between documentary and fiction. Stephan Holden of The New York Times wrote about Har'el's film Bombay Beach: \"[it] looks and feels like a fever dream about an alternate universe. Suffused with a sense of wonder, it hovers, dancing inside its own ethereal bubble\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alma_Har'el> .

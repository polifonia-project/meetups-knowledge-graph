The Guardian selected the release among its ten best contemporary discs of 2020, writing, \"what's remarkable is how radically different Christine Ott manages to make the ondes sound on each track: from a primeval, guttural sound on the 13-minute Odysseus to a chirruping boy soprano on Ultraviolet.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christine_Ott> .

Easton's first two singles, \"Modern Girl\" and \"9 to 5\", both entered the UK Top Ten. She became one of the most successful British female performers of the 1980s. A six-time Grammy nominee in the US, Easton is a two-time Grammy Award winner, winning Best New Artist in 1982 and Best Mexican-American Performance in 1985, for her duet with Luis Miguel on the song \"Me Gustas Tal Como Eres\".

He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Drew McIntyre. McIntyre is a two-time WWE Champion, one-time WWE Intercontinental Champion, one-time NXT Champion, and a two-time WWE (Raw) Tag Team Champion, and also won the 2020 Slammy Award for Superstar of the Year. He performed as Drew Galloway outside of WWE from 2001–2007 and again from 2014–2017, most notably with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he was a one-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion and one-time Impact Grand Champion. He has also wrestled extensively on the independent circuit, where he is the inaugural and two-time ICW World Heavyweight Champion, one-time Evolve Champion, one-time Open the Freedom Gate Champion, two-time Evolve Tag Team Champion, and one-time WCPW Champion. Galloway returned to WWE in April 2017 under the Drew McIntyre ring name and joined its then-developmental brand NXT, where he won the NXT Championship at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III, becoming the first man to win the championship in his TakeOver in-ring debut and the first WWE wrestler to hold it after having previously won a championship on the main roster. Upon returning to WWE's main roster in 2018, he won the Raw Tag Team Championship, the 2020 Men's Royal Rumble match, and the WWE Championship in the main event of the second night of WrestleMania 36. He is the first British world champion in WWE and the 31st Triple Crown champion. In total, Galloway is a five-time world champion in professional wrestling." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drew_McIntyre> .

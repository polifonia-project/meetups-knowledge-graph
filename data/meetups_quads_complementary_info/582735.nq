<http://dbpedia.org/resource/C._W._McCall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Dale Fries Jr. (November 15, 1928 â€“ April 1, 2022) was an American advertising executive and spoken word artist who won several Clio Awards for his advertising campaigns. He is best known for his character C. W. McCall, a truck-driving country singer he originally created for a series of bread commercials; Fries later assumed the role of McCall for a series of outlaw albums and songs in the 1970s, in collaboration with co-worker (and Mannheim Steamroller founder) Chip Davis. McCall's most successful song was \"Convoy\", a surprise pop-crossover hit in 1975, reaching number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 2 in the British charts in March 1976. Fries was elected mayor of Ouray, Colorado, and served in that position from 1986 to 1992." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/C._W._McCall> .

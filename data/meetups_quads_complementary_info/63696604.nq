Records, which specializes in comedy, and -ismist Recordings, which focused on punk and alternative rock from Nebraska and nearby Midwestern states. Schlissel won a Grammy as producer of Lewis Black's 2006 album The Carnegie Hall Performance, and was nominated for his work on Black's two Grammy-nominated albums, Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues and Anticipation. He is known for his work with Black and other comics including Doug Stanhope, Maria Bamford, Marc Maron, and Mitch Hedberg, and helping release the debut record of Iowa metal band Slipknot. Comedian and actor Marc Maron, who released his first three albums on Stand Up!, described Schlissel as \"a guy who loves comedy, and is very attentive to the process of recording comedy,\" and, referencing the large number of noteworthy comics who were given important exposure in their early careers by the label, joked that \"you've done everybody's first two records.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Schlissel> .

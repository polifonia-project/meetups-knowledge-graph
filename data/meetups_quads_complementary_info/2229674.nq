<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddy_Grant> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edmond Montague Grant (born 5 March 1948) is a Guyanese-British singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, known for his genre-blending sound; his music has blended elements of pop, British rock, soul, funk, reggae, electronic music, African polyrhythms, and Latin music genres such as samba, among many others. In addition to this, he also helped to pioneer the genre of \"Ringbang\". He was a founding member of the Equals, one of the United Kingdom's first racially-mixed pop groups who are best remembered for their million-selling UK chart-topper, the Grant-penned \"Baby, Come Back\". His subsequent solo career included the 1982 song \"I Don't Wanna Dance\", plus the platinum 1983 single \"Electric Avenue\", which is his biggest international hit. He earned a Grammy Award nomination for the song. He is also well known for the anti-apartheid 1988 song, \"Gimme Hope Jo'anna\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddy_Grant> .

As a sophomore in the 1980–81 season, Britt was joined by 6'10\" center Earl Jones, forming an explosive combination, and in 1982, Britt was named the outstanding player in the NCAA Division II tournament and the Firebirds won the championship with a 25–5 overall mark. Britt had his first taste of International competition at the Jones Cup in Taipei in 1982, An incoming senior that year, Britt combined forces with such stars as Chris Mullin and Aubrey Sherrod to power the United States to the championship under coach George Raveling.

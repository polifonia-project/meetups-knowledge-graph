<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_McGlaughlin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William McGlaughlin (born October 3, 1943) is an American composer, conductor, music educator, and Peabody Award-winning classical music radio host. He is the host and music director of the public radio programs Exploring Music and Saint Paul Sunday. A nationally noted radio commentator since 1981, Bill McGlaughlin is known for his cheerful, open, and down-to-earth personality on classical music radio. Beyond his career as a broadcaster and music educator, McGlaughlin has also spent a decade as a professional orchestral musician, over three decades as a conductor, and a decade as a successful composer. He views the more recent, radio broadcast aspect of his musical career as outreach â€” as a way to keep classical music from becoming an increasingly marginalized art form, with ever-smaller and older audiences." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_McGlaughlin> .

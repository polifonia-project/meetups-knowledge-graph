<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adrian_Legg> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Adrian Legg (born 16 May 1948) is an English guitar player who has been called \"impossible to categorize\". He plays custom guitars that are a hybrid of electric and acoustic, and his fingerstyle picking technique has been acknowledged by the readers of Guitar Player who voted Legg the \"best acoustic fingerstyle\" player four years in a row (1993â€“1996). From his early start as a bench technician customising electric guitars, Legg moved into guitar instruction, publishing books and videos on guitar technique. In 1996 and 1997, Legg shared the stage with acclaimed guitar experts Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson and Steve Vai as part of the G3 tour. Vai called Legg \"Uncle Adrian\" and Satriani said of Legg's musicianship, \"He's simply the best acoustic guitar player I've ever heard. I don't know anyone else who can create such a cascade of beautiful notes... Adrian plays like he's got hammers for fingers.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adrian_Legg> .

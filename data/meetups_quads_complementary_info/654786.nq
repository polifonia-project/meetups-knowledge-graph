His song “The Ballad of Davy Crockett“ hit the top of the Billboard charts in the spring of 1955. Following a successful career as a musician which began in the late 1940s, Hayes began to focus on dramatic acting parts in the late 1960s, which led him to be cast in a role that gained him additional fame to a younger generation. This new chapter began in 1970 when he originated the character of Doug Williams on NBC's Days of Our Lives, which he continues to play to date." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Hayes_(actor)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Riff_Raff_(rapper)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Horst Christian Simco (born January 29, 1982), better known by his stage name Riff Raff (often stylized as RiFF RAFF), is an American rapper. He was originally managed by Swishahouse co-founder OG Ron C. After being associated with rapper and producer Soulja Boy's imprint S.O.D. Money Gang Inc., Riff Raff was signed to DJ and producer Diplo's record label Mad Decent from 2013 to 2015. Simco was formerly a member of the rap group Three Loco along with Andy Milonakis and Dirt Nasty, who reunited on his Balloween 2016 Halloween mixtape performing \"Bitches in my Driveway\". The trio premiered a Christmas parody song, \"Ho-Ho-Loco\", in the TBS Surprise! Instant Xmas Carol special. His debut studio album, Neon Icon, was released in 2014 via Mad Decent. In April 2016, Riff Raff announced a joint partnership with Stampede Management and BMG, signing a four-million-dollar artist venture agreement for his own label and production company, \"Neon Nation Corporation\". The joint deal fell apart in the wake of legal disputes with the publication of the 2012 film Spring Breakers. In February 2018, Riff Raff announced on his Instagram that he signed to singer Blackbear's Beartrap Sound for a reported $500,000 along with a Beartrap Sound pendant and chain." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Riff_Raff_(rapper)> .

He was a member of the Congolese band , which was later renamed Afrisa International, led by Congolese music superstar, Tabu Ley. Later, in the early 1970s, Michelino left Afrisa and joined TPOK Jazz, led by Fran√ßois Luambo Makiadi, which dominated the Congolese music scene from the 1950s through the 1980s. Born and raised by Angolan parents, in the Congolese port-city of Matadi, Michelino moved to Kinshasa, as a teenager. Michelino now lives, plays and teaches music in Paris, France. He has a band of about eight members." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michelino_Mavatiku_Visi> .

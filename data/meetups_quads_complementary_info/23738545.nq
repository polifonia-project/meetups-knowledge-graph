<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angela_Dimitriou> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Angela Dimitriou (Greek: Άντζελα Δημητρίου, Greek pronunciation: [ˌand͜zela ðimiˈtriu]; born Athens, Greece, August 18, 1954) is a Greek singer. She is also famous in the Arab countries across the Middle East, with her song \"Margarites\" hitting the top of the charts in Lebanon, among other places. She made a song with Egyptian singer Amr Diab called \"Ana Bahebak Aktar.\" Both songs were produced by Minos-Emi Greece A&R manager through his connections with EMI Arabia. She also covered Marc Almond's song \"Death's Diary\", in Greek titled \"Astrapes kai Vrontes\" (Lightnings and Thunders). She is often criticized because of her low education and her comic manner of verbal expression. Angela Dimitriou's biggest hit and signature song is \"Fotia Sta Savvatovrada\" (\"Fire on Saturday Nights\") produced by Sony Music A&R manager . Her CD single Ah Patrida Mou went gold. On 14 March 2010, Alpha TV ranked Dimitriou the ninth top-certified female artist in the nation's phonographic era (since 1960)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angela_Dimitriou> .

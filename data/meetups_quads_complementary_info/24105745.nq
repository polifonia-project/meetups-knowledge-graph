Lowry (April 1, 1941 â€“ June 29, 2022) was an American folklorist, writer, record producer, ethnomusicologist, historian, photographer, forensic musicologist, and teacher who dealt with aspects of popular music, mainly African-American. Born in Montclair, New Jersey, he attended Deerfield Academy, and then Princeton University, where he specialized in the biological sciences. Teaching biology for a few years after obtaining a Master's in zoology, he changed his focus to blues and jazz with a primary focus on the Piedmont blues of the south-eastern United States. He wrote extensively on blues and jazz music, founded Trix Records, and moved to live in Australia in later life." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_B._Lowry> .

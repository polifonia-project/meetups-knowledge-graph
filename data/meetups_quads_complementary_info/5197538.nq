<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_McLoone> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul Martin McLoone (born 11 February 1967) is an Irish musician, former radio producer, voice actor, voice-over artist and radio presenter from Derry, Northern Ireland. He is perhaps best known for being the co-creator and co-writer of the Irish comedy sketch series Gift Grub. He is also the lead vocalist/frontman of the Northern Irish pop-punk/new-wave band The Undertones, permanently replacing Feargal Sharkey when the band reunited for a series of live appearances in November 1999. He hosts the weekday evening/night-time radio programme on the Irish national and independent radio station, Today FM titled The Paul McLoone Show which broadcasts from Dublin every Monday to Thursday from 10:00 pm to midnight. It focuses on less-known Irish solo singers or bands, as well as those from other countries who are popular in the alternative and indie rock world, but who have yet to crack the mainstream line of the music industry. McLoone also hosted a radio programme titled Another Side on TXFM (formerly Phantom FM), a sister station to Today FM that broadcasts to Dublin City and its surrounding areas. The programme, which aired from 17 January 2015 to 2 July 2016, was dedicated to giving an in-depth profile of a single major musician or band by playing various songs associated with the band or the musician's career, including ones that may not have been released as singles. The show aired for one hour at 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm every Saturday on TXFM and was repeated every Sunday night from 10:00 pm to 11:00 pm with fellow radio presenter John Caddell. From March 2012 to March 2016, McLoone served as the main presenter for the main awards ceremony of the Choice Music Prize, an annual awards ceremony in Dublin every year; it began in 2005 with the Choice Music Prize awarded to a band or musician from Ireland whose album is deemed worthy of the prize by a panel of judges composed of various people from all aspects of Irish media. McLoone was originally involved in the background running of the awards before making his debut as M.C. at the 2011 prize ceremony, a role he held for five years until the Choice Music Prize started broadcast on RTÃ‰ 2FM from 2017 onwards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_McLoone> .

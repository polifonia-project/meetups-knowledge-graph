<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonny_Brogan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Patrick Joseph \"Sonny\" Brogan (4 July 1906 â€“ 1 January 1965) was an Irish accordion player from the 1930s to the 1960s, and was one of Ireland's most popular traditional musicians. He was one of the earliest advocates of the two-row B/C button accordion in traditional music, and popularised it the 1950s and 60s. He originally played on a single-keyed Hohner melodeon, and later the two-row Paolo Soprani (pictured) which he used until he died. Sonny's Paolo Soprani was one of the rarest, the grey model, made in 1948, when the company still made them by hand. Offaly-born button box player Paddy O'Brien currently has Sonny's accordion." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonny_Brogan> .

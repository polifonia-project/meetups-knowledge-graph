<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hank_Locklin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hank Locklin (born Lawrence Hankins Locklin; February 15, 1918 â€“ March 8, 2009) was an American country music singer-songwriter. He had 70 chart singles, including two number one hits on Billboard's country chart. His biggest hits included \"Send Me the Pillow You Dream On\" and his signature \"Please Help Me, I'm Falling\". The latter also went to number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 pop music chart. Billboard's 100th anniversary issue listed it as the second most successful country single of the rock and roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Locklin was born and raised in Florida. He developed a fondness for country music following an accident in his childhood. He learned to play the guitar during his recovery and began performing locally as well. In his early adulthood, he formed his own band called the Rocky Mountain Playboys, which played gigs and performed on local radio. Locklin was heard singing during one of these gigs, which led to his first recording contract in 1949. He had his first major hit on the Billboard country chart the same year. His 1953 single, \"Let Me Be the One\" was his first to top the country chart. In 1955, Locklin signed with RCA Victor Records and under the production of Chet Atkins, he had his biggest success as a country artist. He had a string of major hits during the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also joined the cast of the Grand Ole Opry and remained a member for nearly 50 years. He became a major concert attraction internationally as well, touring overseas in Europe beginning in the 1960s and 70s. Locklin also recorded a handful of concept albums during this period, which made him among the genre's first artists to release albums centered around a theme. He would later record for other labels, including MGM, Plantation and Coldwater. Despite his country success, Locklin never lived in Nashville, choosing instead to stay in his home state of Florida. Locklin died in 2009 at the age of 91." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hank_Locklin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Camp_(footballer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lee Michael John Camp (born 22 August 1984) is a professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper most recently for National League club Wrexham. Internationally, he represented Northern Ireland, being eligible through his Northern Ireland-born grandfather, although he previously played for the England under-21 team. Camp started his professional career with Derby County in 2002, having progressed through the club's youth ranks. During a five-year spell at the club, he made 89 league appearances for Derby, and also went on loan to three clubs: Burton Albion in 2003, Queens Park Rangers in 2004 and 2007, and Norwich City, in 2006. He switched to Queens Park Rangers in July 2007, and made 50 league appearances for the club in a two-season spell, taking his total number of QPR appearances to 73. Between October 2008 and January 2009, Camp was loaned to Nottingham Forest, signing permanently for the club in July 2009. In total, he made 182 league appearances for Nottingham Forest before returning to Norwich City in January 2013. He made three appearances in his second spell at the club, before being released on a free transfer in May 2013. Camp joined West Bromwich Albion in September 2013 and spent two months on loan at AFC Bournemouth. He was released by West Brom in January 2014 and subsequently joined Bournemouth on a two-and-a-half-year deal, but left after one year for Rotherham United, where he was a regular for 18 months until an injured knee kept him out for the rest of his contract. He then joined Cardiff City, but never played, and spent time on loan at Sunderland before signing for Birmingham City, where he spent two seasons as first choice. He had a short non-playing spell at Coventry City as injury cover before spending the last two months of the 2020â€“21 season with Swindon Town. Camp began a short-term contract with non-league side Clitheroe in February 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Camp_(footballer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaye_Advert> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gaye Advert (born 25 August 1956), also Gaye Black, is an English punk rock musician, who played bass guitar in the band The Adverts in the late 1970s. She was one of the first female rock stars of the punk rock movement, whom The Virgin Encyclopedia of 70s Music called the \"first female punk star\". She was \"one of punkâ€™s first female icons\". Dave Thompson wrote that her \"photogenic\" looks, \"panda-eye make-up and omnipresent leather jacket defined the face of female punkdom until well into the next decade\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaye_Advert> .

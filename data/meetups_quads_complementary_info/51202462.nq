His songs \"Silence\", \"Wolves\", \"Friends\", \"Happier\", and \"Alone\" have been certified multi-platinum in several countries and appeared in the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100. His musical style includes groove-oriented, synth and bass-heavy electronic dance music. He is managed by Moe Shalizi. Marshmello first gained international recognition in early 2015 by publishing remixes online. His debut studio album, Joytime, was released in January 2016, which included the lead single and Marshmello's debut single \"Keep It Mello\". \"Alone\", a platinum-certified single was released in May 2016 via the Canadian record label Monstercat. Having peaked on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 60, it became his first single to be certified platinum in the US and Canada with over 1 million copies of certified units. That year, he released three subsequent singles. In 2017, after releasing singles such as \"Chasing Colors\", \"Twinbow\" and \"Moving On\", Marshmello collaborated with American R&B singer Khalid to release \"Silence\" as a single, which was certified platinum and multi-platinum in eight countries. Succeeding another single, one of his bestselling singles, a collaboration with American singer Selena Gomez, titled \"Wolves\" was released. In 2018, he released \"Friends\", a collaboration with British singer Anne-Marie. Months later, his second studio album, Joytime II, was released with singles \"Tell Me\" and \"Check This Out\". \"Happier\", a collaboration with British band Bastille, was released in August and became his highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 at #2. In 2019, he earned $40 million, ranking second on the list of highest paid DJs compiled by Forbes. In 2020, he and American rapper Juice Wrld released \"Come & Go\", from the latter's posthumous album Legends Never Die; the song reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100, matching \"Happier\" as his highest-charting song. In 2021, his album Shockwave earned him a Grammy nomination. Marshmello wears a custom white helmet, resembling a marshmallow, for public appearances and in his music videos. His identity was initially a secret, but was confirmed by Forbes to be Chris Comstock in April 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marshmello> .

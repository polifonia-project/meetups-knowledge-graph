Finkelstein began his career in music as the manager of The Paupers from 1966 to 1967 and Kensington Market from 1967 to 1969. In 1969, Finkelstein founded True North Records. The first artist signed to the label in 1969 was Bruce Cockburn. Through 1972–1981, in partnership with Bernie Fiedler, he managed the careers of Ronney Abramson, Bruce Cockburn, Murray McLauchlan and Dan Hill. In 1970, he and Cockburn became partners in the music publishing firm Golden Mountain Music. By the time Finkelstein sold True North, the label had released over 550 albums, including records from such Canadian notables as Rough Trade, Randy Bachman, The Rheostatics, Lynn Miles, Cowboy Junkies, Colin Linden, Catherine MacLellan, Tom Wilson, Moxy Früvous, and Lighthouse, among others. True North continued to also release records for acts that Finkelstein managed including Blackie & The Rodeo Kings, Murray McLauchlan, Stephen Fearing, Barney Bentall and Bruce Cockburn. During the period from 1969 to 2007 True North received over 40 Gold and Platinum records and over 40 Juno Awards. In December 2007, True North was acquired by an investment group led by Linus Entertainment. Finkelstein remained as chairman and long-term consultant. He continued as Cockburn's manager and also managed The Golden Dogs. Until 2011, Finkelstein was the Chairman of MUCHFACT for 26 years, an organization he co-founded with Moses Znaimer in 1984 when it was known as VideoFACT. Finkelstein was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2003.

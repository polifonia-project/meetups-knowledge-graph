Brennan's musical style contains elements of glam rock, psychedelic soul, R&B, Indie pop and power pop, combined with dense vocal harmonies and revealing literate lyrics that occasionally draw on vaudeville, music hall, mythical and biblical themes. In 2016, Brennan released her first full-length studio album, Debutante, to significant acclaim, landing on numerous best-of-2016 lists including the Village Voice Pazz & Jop list. Her second studio album, Third, was recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis and was released via Omnivore Recordings on April 21, 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cait_Brennan> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Park> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mike Park is a Korean American musician and progressive activist. His musical ventures include Skankin' Pickle for whom he both played the saxophone and sang, The Chinkees, The Bruce Lee Band, and Ogikubo Station, as well as an acoustic solo project under his own name. After his time with Skankin' Pickle he went on to found Asian Man Records, a label which he has run out of his garage in California since 1996 with only help from his parents and friends. Asian Man Records supports mostly ska and punk bands. Park will support any band as long as it is \"anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-prejudice\". Park has used Asian Man Records to release his own music, in addition to providing a start for smaller bands to allow them to grow, including Less Than Jake, Alkaline Trio, and The Lawrence Arms. In 1999 he formed the Plea for Peace Foundation an organization whose aim is \"to promote the ideas of peace through the power of music\", something which Park has been trying to do with his own bands and with the help of other groups. Park was the impetus behind the Spring 1998 \"Ska Against Racism\" tour. The goal of the tour was to promote awareness about racism and raise money for anti-racism organisations such as the Museum of Tolerance. The national tour included The Toasters, Less Than Jake, the Blue Meanies, Mustard Plug, Five Iron Frenzy, MU330, Kemuri, and Mike Park himself." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Park> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Rutherford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Sherman \"Johnny\" Rutherford III (born March 12, 1938), also known as \"Lone Star JR\", is an American former automobile racing driver. During an Indy Car career that spanned more than three decades, he scored 27 wins and 23 pole positions in 314 starts. He became one of ten drivers to win the Indianapolis 500 at least three times, winning in 1974, 1976, and 1980. He also won the CART championship in 1980. Rutherford began racing modified stock cars in 1959 and he also dabbled in stock car racing, making 35 NASCAR Cup Series starts from 1963 to 1988. Rutherford won in his first start, at Daytona International Speedway driving for Smokey Yunick. This made him one of the youngest drivers ever to win in NASCAR history, in a full points-paying NASCAR race." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Rutherford> .

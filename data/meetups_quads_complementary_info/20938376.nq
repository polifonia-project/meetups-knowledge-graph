He is the lead singer of the Camden-based hip hop and grime trio N-Dubz, with his cousin Tulisa and Fazer. He was known for his lack of dress sense and his love for what he describes as \"eye-catching headwear\". His trademark was wearing a selection of woolly chullos (sometimes referred to as \"Dappy hats\"), turning up one or both of the ear-flaps of the hat." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dappy> .

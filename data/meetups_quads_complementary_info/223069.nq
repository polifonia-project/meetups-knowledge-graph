He was born in Geneva, Switzerland. His father is of French and Swiss background and his mother is French. The Berlin-based flutist is most known for his baroque and classical flute repertoire. Pahud was born into a nonmusical family.As a young boy living in Italy, Pahud was captivated by the sounds of the flute.From the age of four to the age of 22, he was tutored and mentored by flutists such as Fran√ßois Binet, Carlos Bruneel and Aurele Nicolet.Classically trained at the Conservatoire de Paris, he leapt into the international orchestral and solo music scene when he joined the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1992.His versatility in music styles over the years has \"signalled the arrival of a new master flautist\" (The Guardian). He plays in diverse music genres, whether baroque, jazz, contemporary, classical, orchestral, or chamber music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emmanuel_Pahud> .

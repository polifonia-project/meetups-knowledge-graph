<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koolade> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Matko Šašek, also known as Koolade is a Croatian hip-hop, electronic, and urban music producer. Born in Zagreb in the late 1970s, he began his music career in the late 1990s. Along with other members of the Blackout family he played a major role in establishing hip-hop genre in the Croatian and regional (Balkans) music scene, rocking charts, record sales and winning a few national music awards (local equivalent to the Grammys) in Croatia and Bosnia. Later he and his partner/manager Phat Phillie realized that his production would make a good export, and continued to expand his work throughout Europe and the U.S., where he is perhaps best known for his production work on Masta Ace's \"Beautiful\" on the album A Long Hot Summer, as well as a number of other prominent American hip-hop artists such as Ghostface Killah and Masta Killa of the Wu Tang Clan, Sean Price, Xzibit, Sadat X, Styles P, Diamond D, Das EFX, Peedi Crakk, Tony Touch, Rah Digga, Too Short, Bow Wow, and others. Koolade is locally and regionally known for his collaborations with the Croatian hip-hop groups Tram 11 and Bolesna Braća, as well as Bosnian rappers Edo Maajka and Frenkie." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koolade> .

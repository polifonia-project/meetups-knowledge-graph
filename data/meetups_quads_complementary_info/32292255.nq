<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shonali_Bose> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shonali Bose (born 3 June 1965) is an Indian film director, writer and film producer. Having made her feature film debut in 2005, she has since won such accolades as a National Film Award, a Bridgestone Narrative Award, and a Sundance Mahindra Global Filmmaker Award. Bose earned her breakthrough with her first feature film, the 2005 biographical drama Amu, which was based on her own novel of the same name. The film which chronicles the attacks on Sikhs in Delhi in 1984, garnered critical acclaim and the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in English. Bose then worked as the assistant director for the 2012 war film Chittagong, which she also co-wrote. Bose's status as a filmmaker grew following the critical and commercial success of the dramas Margarita with a Straw (2015) and The Sky Is Pink (2019). Inspired from the life of Malini Chibâ€”her cousin and a disability rights activist, the former earned Bose a Sundance Mahindra Global Filmmaker Award and a NETPAC Award. Bose is also an active philanthropist and supports various charitable organisations. She was married to filmmaker Bedabrata Pain, but the couple separated following the death of their son." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shonali_Bose> .

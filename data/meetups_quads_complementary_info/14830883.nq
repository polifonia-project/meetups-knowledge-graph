<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virgil_Moorefield> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Virgil Moorefield (born August 9, 1956) is a composer and intermedia artist based in RÃ¼schlikon, Switzerland. Moorefield's work focuses primarily on live acoustic performance, electronic processing of acoustic signals, and live visual music (\"Five Ideas About the Relation of Sight and Sound\"). CDs of his composer-led ensembles have been released on several labels, including Tzadik, Cuneiform, and Innova. His compositions are informed by his identity as a drummer. He is also the author of The Producer as Composer, published by MIT Press." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virgil_Moorefield> .

His brassy instrumentations have drawn comparisons to action-music composer guru Alan Silvestri and his other orchestral-music composer counterparts Michael Giacchino, J.A.C. Redford and Joel McNeely. His chance encounter with Gil Kenan at UCLA California made him the perfect composer for this soundtrack and composed the music on his short film The Lark. Awards include International Film Music Critics Association \"Best Original Score for a Comedy Film 2015\" for the Horror/Comedy Krampus, \"Compositor Revalacion\" for Monster House at the 3rd International Film Music Conference in Ubeda, Spain and \"Best Animation” at the Royal Television Society in the United Kingdom.

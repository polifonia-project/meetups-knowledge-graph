<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Henzerling> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Philip Henzerling (born 3 May 1961), a.k.a. David Michael-Philips, is an American musician, songwriter and producer. He has been a member of numerous hard rock bands including Schoolboys, Keel, King Kobra, Lizzy Borden, Geronimo!, Liquid Black, Big Cock, Icon, Tunnel, Steelshine and Kelly Keeling & Friends. He is the older brother of Dan Henzerling, also a musician and has two sisters (both younger). David was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and moved to Phoenix, Arizona with his family in December 1969. He claims to have been blessed with the good fortune of \"...growing up in the 60s, being a teenager in the 70s, living my 20s during the big-80s and starting a family in the 90s...I think I benefited from the best that each decade had to offer...\" Although his childhood obsession had always been drawing (he was an avid comic book collector and cartoon artist), music was always his primary passion. As a guitarist, he cites Ritchie Blackmore (Deep Purple), Edward Van Halen (Van Halen), and Ace Frehley (Kiss) as his major influences. At 14, his uncle took him to his first concert â€“ \"It was Joe Walsh and Charlie Daniels in 1975\", David says, \"From the first note played, I was hooked! After that, I saw pretty much every show that came to (Phoenix)\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Henzerling> .

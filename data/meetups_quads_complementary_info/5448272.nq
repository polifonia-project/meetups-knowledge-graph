<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Carter_(American_musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chris Paul Carter (born September 2, 1959) is an American disc jockey and music/film producer based in Los Angeles. Carter started his music career as a founding member and bass player with alternative rock/power pop band Dramarama. After Dramarama originally split in 1994, Carter formed QM Management to manage the pop group Wondermints. Until September 2006, KLSX aired Carter's Breakfast with the Beatles, America's longest-running Beatles-based radio show, on which he played almost nothing but Beatles material and commented upon the history of the group for as long as four hours every week. In November 2006, the show moved to its new Los Angeles home, KLOS-FM, which bills itself as \"L.A.'s Only Classic Rock Station Since 1969,\" and can be heard every Sunday from 9 am to 12noon PST. In September 2008, Carter started a new version of Breakfast with the Beatles for Sirius XM Satellite Radio, which was broadcast (9AM-noon ET repeating again at Midnight ET) on the Underground Garage channel, both Sirius 21 and XM 21. In December 2008, Breakfast with the Beatles debuted its new web site. In April 2013, Carter began a new show on Sirius/XM, \"Chris Carter's British Invasion\". Breakfast with the Beatles, with Chris Carter, now takes place one Sunday every month at the Kobe Steak House in Seal Beach, California. As a producer, Carter supervised and produced the music for the film Mayor of the Sunset Strip, a rock documentary about influential Los Angeles disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer of KROQ-FM. In 2003, the film won \"Best Documentary\" in the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and was nominated for Best Documentary by the Independent Spirit Awards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Carter_(American_musician)> .

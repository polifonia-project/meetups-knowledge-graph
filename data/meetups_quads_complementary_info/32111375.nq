<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celph_Titled> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Victor Mercer (born November 16, 1980), better known by his stage name Celph Titled, is an American rapper and record producer who is a member of the hip hop supergroup Army of the Pharaohs, as well as the Demigodz along with Connecticut rapper Apathy, Ryu from Get Busy Committee, and rapper Blacastan and Esoteric. Mercer moved to New York City and began working as an in-house producer and A&R. The now-defunct BUDS International and Bronx Science Records released all of his early records on vinyl, including those of his original group, Equilibrium, and singles from his longstanding partner, Apathy. Grammy Award-winner Mike Shinoda, of Linkin Park, invited Mercer to join his Los Angeles cohorts, Styles of Beyond, as an official part of Fort Minor's album The Rising Tied (2005). After working with DJ Green Lantern on the Invasion \"Fort Minor: We Major\" mixtape, Mercer embarked on a nationwide tour with Fort Minor in 2006. Mercer released The Gatalog, a four-disc set of his guest appearances and freestyles, going back to his early releases from 1998, as his official first offering to a thriving fanbase that already viewed him as a seasoned veteran. After the release of The Gatalog and a move back to Tampa, Mercer spent three years working with D.I.T.C. multi-platinum producer, Buckwild, on his first album, Nineteen Ninety Now, released on October 26, 2010, on No Sleep Recordings." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celph_Titled> .

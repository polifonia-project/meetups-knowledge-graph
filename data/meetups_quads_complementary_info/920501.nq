<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maynard_James_Keenan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Maynard James Keenan (born James Herbert Keenan; April 17, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and winemaker. He is best known as the singer and primary lyricist of the rock bands Tool, A Perfect Circle, and Puscifer. Originally from Ohio, Keenan spent his high school and college years in Michigan. He joined the U.S. Army after graduating from high school. After leaving the Army, he attended the Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1988 to pursue a career in interior design and set construction, and formed Tool with Adam Jones shortly thereafter. In addition to his music career, Keenan owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars in Arizona, where he resides. Since rising to fame, he has been noted as a recluse, although he does emerge to support charitable causes and for the occasional interview. He has also ventured into acting." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maynard_James_Keenan> .

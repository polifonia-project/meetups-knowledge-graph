<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kana_Nishino> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kana Nishino (西野カナ, Nishino Kana, born March 18, 1989) is a Japanese singer and songwriter signed with SME Records' Newcome Inc. She debuted on February 20, 2008, with the single \"I\". Often considered one of Japan's most popular female singers of the late 2000s and 2010s, she gained early popularity with the R&B singles \"Tookutemo\" (with rapper WISE) and \"Kimi ni Aitaku Naru Kara\". Her first studio album, \"LOVE one.\" (2009), debuted at number four on charts and went on to become certified platinum. She achieved further success with her sophomore and first number-one album, \"To Love\" (2010), which was preceded by the singles \"Motto...\", \"Dear...\", \"Best Friend\" and \"Aitakute Aitakute\" which were all certified \"million\" for full song downloads of over 1 million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), establishing Nishino as a dominant force on music charts and digital platforms. The album, certified platinum three times, became the third best-selling album of 2010 and the single \"Aitakute Aitakute\" was the best-selling digital song of the year. While enjoying continuous mainstream success with her following records \"Thank You, Love\" (2011), \"LOVE Place\" (2012) and \"with LOVE\" (2014), Nishino's music also evolved from R&B to pop. In the mid-2010s, she successfully ventured into country pop with the singles \"Darling\" (2014) and \"Torisetsu\" (2015). The latter, the theme song of the live action film Heroine Shikkaku, became the best-selling digital song of 2015 with over one million copies sold. She subsequently released the albums \"Just LOVE\" (2016) and \"LOVE it\" (2017), certified platinum and gold respectively. In 2016, she won the Grand Prix at the 58th Japan Record Awards for her single \"Anata no Suki na Tokoro\", the first female solo artist to do so since Koda Kumi in 2005. In 2017, she reached a new milestone when becoming the youngest female solo artist and the first female one born in the Heisei era to perform at the prestigious Tokyo Dome as part of the \"Kana Nishino Dome Tour 2017 Many Thanks\". Due to her popularity with the Japanese female audience, Nishino appears frequently on fashion magazine covers and she is often regarded as a \"style icon\". It was particularly apparent in her early days due to her association with the Gyaru fashion subculture, leading her music to be referred to as \"Gyaru Enka\" (\"Gyaru heartbreak songs\"). In 2009, CNN said that she was the favorite singer of teenage girls in Shibuya, Tokyo. Nishino is also known for her \"relatable\" lyrics about love. She was awarded \"Artist of the Year\" two times in 2014 and 2015 by Billboard Japan. Since her debut, she has sold over six million records and over 46 million downloads, making her one of the most successful female artists in the digital chart history of Japan. On January 8, 2019, Nishino announced an \"indefinite\" hiatus starting on February 3 of the same year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kana_Nishino> .

Miller released two albums in his lifetime: The hard-edged and violent The Dark Roads and the more typically laid-back West Coast style Reality Check. Miller was shot to death in a drive-by shooting on July 31, 1996. The killing remains unsolved and the perpetrator remains unknown. He is interred in Oakland. His first posthumous album titled Souls on Ice was released in 1997. Seagram also recorded collaborations with his labelmates, the Geto Boys." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seagram_(rapper)> .

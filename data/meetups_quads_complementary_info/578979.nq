He also held office as Secretary of State of Texas (1973–77), and as Texas Attorney General (1979–83). White was elected governor in the 1982 gubernatorial election, defeating the incumbent Bill Clements. A member of the Democratic Party, White sought to improve education, transportation, water resources, law enforcement, and taxes to lure new industry to Texas. He appointed the first Hispanic woman to serve as judge of a district court in Texas. In the 1986 gubernatorial election, White lost to former Republican Governor Clements, 52.7% to 46.0%." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_White_(Texas_politician)> .

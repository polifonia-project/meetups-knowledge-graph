Raised in Brooklyn, he first gained recognition while still a senior in high school, when he performed live on American music executive DJ Clue's radio show, then on Hot 97. Jackson subsequently signed to DJ Clue's Desert Storm imprint, and later secured a distribution deal with major-label, Elektra. Jackson gained prominence with his first release, Ghetto Fabolous (2001), which spawned the hit singles \"Can't Deny It\" (featuring Nate Dogg) and \"Young'n (Holla Back)\". His second release was 2003's Street Dreams, which was supported by two US top 10 singles, \"Can't Let You Go\" (featuring Lil' Mo) and \"Into You\" (featuring Tamia or Ashanti). Including the aforementioned songs, Jackson's series of hit singles extended throughout the 2000s, including \"Trade It All, Pt. 2\" (featuring Diddy and Jagged Edge), \"Breathe\", \"Make Me Better\" (featuring Ne-Yo), \"Baby Don't Go\" (featuring T-Pain), \"Throw It in the Bag\" (featuring The-Dream) and \"You Be Killin' Em\". He is also known for his appearances on several R&B singles, including \"Superwoman Pt. II\" by Lil' Mo, \"Shawty Is a 10\" by The-Dream, \"Addiction\" by Ryan Leslie, \"She Got Her Own\" by Jamie Foxx, and \"Say Aah\" by Trey Songz, among others. In 2004, Jackson signed to Atlantic Records (another subsidiary of Warner Music Group), after leaving Elektra, where he released Real Talk, his first and only album under Atlantic. In 2006, Jackson was let out of his contract with Atlantic and officially signed with Def Jam Recordings (owned by Warner competitor Universal Music Group). Also in 2006, Jackson founded his own record label, Street Family Records. In 2007, he released From Nothin' to Somethin', under Def Jam. In 2009, he released his fifth album, Loso's Way. Throughout the years, Jackson has amassed a number of self-released mixtapes, including several installments of his highly acclaimed There Is No Competition series and The S.O.U.L. Tape series.

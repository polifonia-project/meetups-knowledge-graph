He is best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Better Than Ezra. His songs have been performed and recorded by artists such as Taylor Swift, Train, Sugarland, James Blunt, Dierks Bentley, The Record Company, Wilder Wood, Moon Taxi, Saint Motel, Andy Grammer, Christina Perri, Trombone Shorty, Howie Day, Barenaked Ladies, Tom Morello, Boys Like Girls, Blondie, Chase Rice, The Struts, Andrew McMahon, Matt Nathanson, Meat Loaf, Missy Higgins, and many others. Griffin also works in music publishing, artist management, and lectures internationally on the subject of creativity to companies and organizations such as Live Nation, Which Wich?, Novation, and YPO-WPO. His first book is slated to be released in the fall of 2022. He is a co-founder and partner of the Pilgrimage Music & Cultural Festival in Franklin, Tennessee. Rolling Stone's review of the festival's inaugural year was positive, saying it had \"an A-list lineup (arguably the best curated of the year)\" and \"established itself as a festival to watch.\" Performers at the festival have included Justin Timberlake, Foo Fighters, Willie Nelson, Chris Stapleton, The Killers, Dave Matthews Band, Maren Morris, The Black Keys, Cage the Elephant, and Black Pumas. Griffin formed the alternative rock band Better Than Ezra in 1988. They had platinum success in the 1990s with hits such as \"Good\", \"In the Blood\", and \"Desperately Wanting\", and have continued in the 2000s with hits such as \"Extra Ordinary\", \"A Lifetime\", and \"Juicy\". The band continues to tour and produce new recordings, the most recent of which is All Together Now, released in September 2014. As a performer, Griffin is known for singing in falsetto, inviting audience members onstage to play guitar, and interrupting his own songs with verses of well-known rock songs. He is also a mimic, imitating singers such as Aaron Neville, Bruce Springsteen, and Dave Matthews. His first solo album, Anywhere You Go, was released on October 4, 2019. Griffin also performs as part of Ezra Ray Hart with Mark McGrath of Sugar Ray and Emerson Hart of Tonic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Griffin> .

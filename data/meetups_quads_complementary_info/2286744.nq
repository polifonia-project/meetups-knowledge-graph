<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Roberts_(criminal)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Harry Maurice Roberts (born 21 July 1936) is an English career criminal and murderer who in 1966 instigated the Shepherd's Bush murders, in which three police officers were shot dead in London. The murders took place after plainclothes officers approached a Standard Vanguard estate car, in which Roberts and two other men were sitting in Braybrook Street near Wormwood Scrubs prison in London. Roberts feared the officers would discover firearms his gang were planning to use in a robbery. He killed two, while one of his accomplices shot dead the third. After Roberts had spent nearly 48 years in prison, in 2014 the Parole Board for England and Wales approved his release, at the age of 78. Having far exceeded his minimum term of 30 years, he was one of the United Kingdom's longest-serving prisoners, having remained in custody since 1966. His release was controversial due to the nature of his crime." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Roberts_(criminal)> .

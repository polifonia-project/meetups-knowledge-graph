<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hayley_Williams> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hayley Nichole Williams (born December 27, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and businesswoman who is best known as the lead vocalist, primary songwriter, and keyboardist of the rock band Paramore. Born and raised in Mississippi, Williams moved to Franklin, Tennessee, at the age of 13 in 2002 to escape her stepfather at the time. In 2004, she formed Paramore alongside Josh Farro, Zac Farro, and Jeremy Davis. The band currently consists of Hayley Williams, Zac Farro and Taylor York. The band has released five studio albums: All We Know Is Falling (2005), Riot! (2007), Brand New Eyes (2009), Paramore (2013), and After Laughter (2017). Williams released her debut solo single, \"Simmer\", on January 22, 2020, and announced on the same day that her debut studio album, Petals for Armor, would be released on May 8, 2020. The album was preceded by two EPs entitled Petals for Armor I and II that make up the first two-thirds of the album. Her second solo record, Flowers for Vases / Descansos, was released less than a year later on February 5, 2021. Aside from Paramore and preceding her solo career, Williams recorded the song \"Teenagers\" for the soundtrack of Jennifer's Body (2009) and has collaborated with artists such as October Fall, The Chariot, Set Your Goals, Zedd and New Found Glory. In 2010, she was featured on the single \"Airplanes\" by B.o.B. It peaked at number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. A sequel to the song, \"Airplanes, Part II\", features new verses from B.o.B. and a verse from Eminem, while Williams' vocals remain the same. This collaboration led to a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Other ventures in which Williams has explored include online beauty and music series Kiss-Off on Popular TV launched in 2015 and the hair-dye company Good Dye Young, launched in 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hayley_Williams> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/L._C._Ulmer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lee Chester \"L. C.\" Ulmer (August 28, 1928 â€“ February 14, 2016) was an American delta blues musician. He was a regular performer for over half a century, playing at festivals and clubs throughout the United States and elsewhere, but particularly in the Deep South. Ulmer was featured in the 2008 documentary film M for Mississippi: A Road Trip Through the Birthplace of the Blues. His earliest musical influence was Blind Roosevelt Graves. Ulmer later met numerous notable musicians, including Elvis Presley, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Brook Benton, Nat King Cole, Fats Domino, Louis Armstrong, Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Howlin' Wolf, and Buddy Guy, and performed with some of them. Ulmer was a multi-instrumentalist and often performed in his younger days as a one-man band." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/L._C._Ulmer> .

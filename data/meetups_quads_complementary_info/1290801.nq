He was the lead voice on such famous songs as \"My Girl\" and \"Ain't Too Proud to Beg.\" Known for his unique raspy and anguished tenor vocals, Ruffin was ranked as one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine in 2008. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 for his work with the Temptations. Fellow Motown recording artist Marvin Gaye once said admiringly of Ruffin that, \"I heard [in his voice] a strength my own voice lacked.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Ruffin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donny_Robinson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Donald Robinson (born June 17, 1983, in Napa, California) is an American professional \"New/Current School\" Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years are from 1999 to the present. His moniker is \"dR\", his initials. The use of the lowercase \"d\" for his given name is perhaps related to his relatively diminutive physical size. A past nickname, \"Scrawny\", was definitely linked to his small stature, since even when very young he was the smallest child in his age group. It was given to him by Bruce Minton. Like BMX predecessors Mike Miranda and Eric Rupe, Robinson is a devout Christian. He admitted in late 2013 to suffering at least 25 concussions over the course of his career. In the same interview, he advocated for better concussion protocol at the lower levels of BMX racing. Robinson joined the board of directors of concussion-education collaborative The Knockout Project in January 2013. On June 25, 2008, Robinson was chosen by Mike King, team coach of the 2008 USA BMX Olympic Team, to represent the USA along with teammates Jill Kintner, Mike Day, and Kyle Bennett in BMX racing competition at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. His Olympic dream was realized at least in part when he came in third at the Summer Olympics winning a Bronze Medal executing a maneuver that saw Sifiso Nhlapo take out nearly half the field. Since it was the sport's debut and the men's final was run after the women's, he became the third American and the sixth person overall to win an Olympic Medal in BMX Racing. Jill Kintner won the Bronze medal; Mike Day won the Silver medal. Kyle Bennett finished sixth in his semi-final and as a result did not qualify for the finals. Robinson announced his retirement of the sport at the 2016 USA BMX Grand Nationals." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donny_Robinson> .

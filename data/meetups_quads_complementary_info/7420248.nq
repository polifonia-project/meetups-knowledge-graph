<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Sams> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eric Sams (3 May 1926 – 13 September 2004) was a British musicologist and Shakespeare scholar. Born in London, he was raised in Essex. His early brilliance in school (Westcliff High School for Boys) earned him a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, at the age of sixteen. His lifelong passion for puzzles and ciphers stood him in good stead in his wartime service in British Intelligence (1944–47). After the war he read Modern Languages at Cambridge (French and German), 1947–50; upon graduation he entered the Civil Service. In 1952 he married Enid Tidmarsh (died 2002), a pianist. Their elder son, Richard, is a Japanese scholar and chess master working in Tokyo; their younger son Jeremy Sams is a composer, lyricist, playwright, and theatre director." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Sams> .

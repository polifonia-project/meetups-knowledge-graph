<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_Jarrett> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Keith Jarrett (born May 8, 1945) is an American jazz and classical music pianist and composer. Jarrett started his career with Art Blakey and later moved on to play with Charles Lloyd and Miles Davis. Since the early 1970s, he has also been a group leader and solo performer in jazz, jazz fusion, and classical music. His improvisations draw from the traditions of jazz and other genres, including Western classical music, gospel, blues, and ethnic folk music. His album, The Köln Concert, released in 1975, became the best-selling piano recording in history. In 2008, he was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in the magazine's 73rd Annual Readers' Poll. In 2003, Jarrett received the Polar Music Prize and was the first recipient to be recognized with prizes for both contemporary and classical music. In 2004, he received the Léonie Sonning Music Prize. In February 2018, Jarrett suffered a stroke and has been unable to perform since. A second stroke, in May 2018, left him partially paralyzed and unable to play with his left hand." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_Jarrett> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dick_McIntire> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dick Kaihue McIntire (1902–1951) was a Honolulu-born steel guitarist active in the 1930s and 1940s. During that era, Hawaiian music was quite popular in the U.S. to the extent of being a musical fad. McIntire performed on hundreds of recordings with artists such as Bing Crosby, Dorothy Lamour, Frances Langford, Ray Kinney, and Lena Machado and was featured in motion picture soundtracks. He was known for his smooth, legato approach to the electric lap steel guitar with his Los Angeles group, The Harmony Hawaiians. His brothers Lani McIntire and Al McIntire were also musicians. According to music historian Andy Volk, Dick McIntire had a profound influence on steel guitar pioneer Jerry Byrd in Byrd's formative years. McIntire was inducted into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame in 1982." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dick_McIntire> .

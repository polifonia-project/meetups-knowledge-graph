Previously the main vocalist and songwriter of Passenger, Rosenberg opted to keep the band's name for his solo work after the band dissolved in 2009. In 2012, he released the song \"Let Her Go\", which topped the charts in 16 countries and accumulated more than 3.3 billion views on YouTube; it is the most-viewed Australian YouTube video of all time. In 2014, the song was nominated for the Brit Award for British Single of the Year, and he received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Most Performed Work." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Passenger_(singer)> .

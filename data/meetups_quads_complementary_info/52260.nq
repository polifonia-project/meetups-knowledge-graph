<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Carpenter> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Howard Carpenter (born January 16, 1948) is an American filmmaker, actor, and composer. Although he worked in various film genres, he is most commonly associated with horror, action, and science fiction films of the 1970s and 1980s. He is generally recognized as one of the greatest masters of the horror genre. At the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the French Directors' Guild gave him the Golden Coach Award, lauding him as \"a creative genius of raw, fantastic, and spectacular emotions\". Carpenter's early films included box office and critical successes like Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Escape from New York (1981), and Starman (1984). His other productions from the 1970s and the 1980s only later came to be considered cult classics, and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. These include Dark Star (1974), Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), The Thing (1982), Christine (1983), Big Trouble in Little China (1986), Prince of Darkness (1987), They Live (1988), In the Mouth of Madness (1994), and Escape from L.A. (1996). He returned to the Halloween franchise as composer and executive producer of the sequel Halloween (2018), doing so with the sequels Halloween Kills (2021) and Halloween Ends (2022). Carpenter composed or co-composed most of his films' music. He won a Saturn Award for Best Music for the film Vampires (1998). He released four studio albums, titled Lost Themes (2015), Lost Themes II (2016), Anthology: Movie Themes 1974â€“1998 (2017), and Lost Themes III: Alive After Death (2021)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Carpenter> .

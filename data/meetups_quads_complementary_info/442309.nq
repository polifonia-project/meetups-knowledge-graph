<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jan_Garbarek> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jan Garbarek (born 4 March 1947) is a Norwegian jazz saxophonist, who is also active in classical music and world music. Garbarek was born in Mysen, Østfold, southeastern Norway, the only child of a former Polish prisoner of war, Czesław Garbarek, and a Norwegian farmer's daughter. He grew up in Oslo, stateless until the age of seven, as there was no automatic grant of citizenship in Norway at the time. When he was 21, he married the author Vigdis Garbarek. He is the father of musician and composer Anja Garbarek." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jan_Garbarek> .

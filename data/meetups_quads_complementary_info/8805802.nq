<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_Rundell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joel Rundell (September 26, 1965 â€“ August 8, 1990) was an American musician best known as one of the four original members and lead guitarist of the Louisiana-based alternative rock band Better Than Ezra. He and the other original members formed the group while attending Louisiana State University. Rundell died by suicide on August 8, 1990, nearly a year after the release of the band's first album, Surprise. After his death, the band went on hiatus before reuniting as a trio by the end of 1990. In 2016, Rundell's family and former drummer Cary Bonnecaze sued the band. Citing the 25th anniversary edition of Surprise, a remastered version, the contention was that Better Than Ezra did not have the right to re-release the album." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_Rundell> .

McG began his career in the music industry, directing music videos and producing various albums. He later rose to prominence with his debut theatrically released narrative feature, Charlie's Angels, which had the highest-grossing opening weekend for a directorial debut at the time. Since then, he has directed several other films, including Terminator Salvation, This Means War, and The Babysitter. On television, McG co-created Fastlane with John McNamara and executive produced The O.C., Supernatural, and Chuck. McG also owns a production company, Wonderland Sound and Vision, founded in 2001, which has overseen the production of the films and television shows he has worked on since Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/McG> .

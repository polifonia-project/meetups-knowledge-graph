Her work has drawn critical acclaim and controversy because her humor often uses self-deprecating and dark topics, including her dysfunctional family, depression, anxiety, suicide, and mental illness. Her first comedy album and tour was The Burning Bridges Tour (2003), followed by eight more albums and specials. One of her first feature films is Lucky Numbers (2000), and she voiced characters on many animated shows, including Shriek on CatDog, and many more on American Dad!, Ugly Americans, Adventure Time, and BoJack Horseman. Her film work includes Stuart Little 2 (2002), Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure (2003), Barnyard (2006), Heckler (2007), and Hell and Back (2015). She voices Talking Ginger and Talking Becca in the Talking Tom and Friends web series. Her live television work began in Louie (2012), Arrested Development (2013–2019), and WordGirl (2007–2015). In 2014, she won the American Comedy Award for Best Club Comic. The 2016 Netflix original series Lady Dynamite, in which she plays the lead role, is based on her life.

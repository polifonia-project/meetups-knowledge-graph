<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Rhodes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nick Rhodes (born Nicholas James Bates, 8 June 1962) is an English musician, singer and producer, best known as the founder, keyboardist, and only continuous member of the band Duran Duran. He is also informally monikered as \"The Controller\", after being introduced as such on stage by bandmate Simon Le Bon during the Astronaut album world tours of 2004â€“2005. Rhodes has been involved in several side projects outside of, but related to, Duran Duran: he released albums with Arcadia in 1985 (featuring 3 members of Duran: Rhodes, Simon Le Bon and Roger Taylor), and recorded and performed as The Devils in 2002 with Stephen Duffy, longtime musical friend and the original lead singer of Duran Duran. In March 2013, he released the TV Mania side project with former Duran Duran guitarist, Warren Cuccurullo." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Rhodes> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lijadu_Sisters> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "The Lijadu Sisters (born 22 October 1948), Taiwo and Kehinde Lijadu (died 9 November 2019), were identical twin sisters from Nigeria who were a Nigerian music duo from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. They achieved success in Nigeria and had modest influence in the United States and Europe. They were notable for being a West African version of the Pointer Sisters who mixed Afrobeat sounds with jazz and disco, according to one source. Since the late 1980s, they retired from the music scene. They were cousins of popular Nigerian musician Fela Kuti." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lijadu_Sisters> .

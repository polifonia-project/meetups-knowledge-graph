<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophie_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sophie Xeon (17 September 1986 â€“ 30 January 2021), known mononymously as Sophie (stylised in all caps), was a Scottish music producer, songwriter, and DJ. Known for a brash and experimental take on pop music that helped pioneer the 2010s hyperpop microgenre, Sophie worked closely with artists from the PC Music label, including A.G. Cook and GFOTY, and produced for acts such as Charli XCX, Vince Staples, Kim Petras, Madonna, Let's Eat Grandma, and Namie Amuro. Sophie, who initially remained anonymous and later came out as a transgender woman, came to prominence with the breakthrough singles \"Bipp\" (2013) and \"Lemonade\" (2014), which were collected on the compilation album Product (2015). Sophie's only studio album Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides followed in 2018, earning a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album. Sophie died in January 2021 after accidentally falling from the rooftop of a three-storey building in Athens. The Fader eulogized Sophie as a \"pioneering Scottish artist whose vibrant electronic productions expanded modern pop music's scope,\" while Pitchfork credited Sophie's influential work with \"mold[ing] electronic music into bracingly original avant-garde pop\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophie_(musician)> .

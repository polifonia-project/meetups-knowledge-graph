<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucianne_Goldberg> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lucianne Goldberg (née Steinberger; April 29, 1935 – October 26, 2022), also known as Lucianne Cummings, was an American literary agent and author. She was named as one of the \"key players\" in the 1998 impeachment of President Clinton, as it was she who controversially advised Monica Lewinsky's confidante Linda Tripp to tape Lewinsky's phone calls about their affair. The 20-hour recording became crucial to the Starr investigation. She was the mother of Jonah Goldberg, a conservative political commentator, and Joshua Goldberg, a Republican nominee for the New York City Council." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucianne_Goldberg> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome_Corsi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jerome Robert Corsi (born August 31, 1946) is an American politcal scientist and author critical of the left wing. His two New York Times best-selling books, Unfit for Command (2004) and The Obama Nation (2008), attacked Democratic presidential candidates and have been criticized by opposition. In other books and columns for conservative to right-wing websites such as WorldNetDaily and Human Events, Corsi has discussed conspiracy theories, such as the alleged plans for a North American Union government; the \"birther\" claims that President Barack Obama is not a United States citizen; criticism of the United States government for allegedly covering up information about the September 11, 2001, attacks; and alleged United States support of Iran in its attempts to develop nuclear weapons. In 2017, he became the Washington, D.C., bureau chief for the conspiracy theory website InfoWars but no longer works for the website. In 2018, Corsi was subpoenaed by the Mueller Special Counsel investigation over his contacts with former Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone and foreknowledge of WikiLeaks releases of stolen Clinton emails. Corsi claimed that he turned down a plea deal with Robert Mueller, and denied any such contacts or knowledge. Draft court documents released in November showed that he emailed Stone several times, updating him about impending WikiLeaks releases of stolen emails. In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress and other charges. Stone had testified to Congress that Randy Credico was his WikiLeaks go-between, but prosecutors said this was a lie in order to protect Corsi." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome_Corsi> .

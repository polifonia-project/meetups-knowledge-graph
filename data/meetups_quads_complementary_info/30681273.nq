<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floyd_Domino> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Floyd Domino is an American musician known for his work in the genre of Western swing. Born a native of California, Domino was introduced to Western swing by way of the musicians who had migrated from Texas and Oklahoma in the 1930s and 1940s. Floyd’s close association with Western swing coincided with joining Asleep at the Wheel at the age of 19. After 7 years with Asleep at the Wheel, he is now an “AATW Alumnus” who still joins them for featured performances. While Floyd is widely recognized for his years with Asleep at the Wheel and the revival of Western swing, Floyd began his career with a broad grounding in jazz, boogie-woogie, swing and blues piano. He regularly performs as Floyd Domino Jazz Trio showcasing a unique blend of jazz and blues. Other performances include work with Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, George Strait, The Texas Playboys, Waylon Jennings, jazz guitarist Herb Ellis, Kelly Willis, Bruce Robison, Monte Warden, Don Walser, jazz vocalist Donna Hightower, and the Crickets. In addition to a career encompassing live performances, recording (both solo and with a host of legendary performers), Floyd has contributed to promoting American roots music through his appearances at schools, camps and other learning organizations. Between his touring, recording and major performances, Floyd plays clubs, private events and contributes his talents to further roots music appreciation" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floyd_Domino> .

He is the commissioner of the Leaders' Debates Commission and former Colonel of the Regiment for the Royal Canadian Regiment. Johnston was born and raised in Ontario, studying there before enrolling at Harvard University and later Cambridge and Queen's universities. He went on to work as a professor at various post-secondary institutions in Canada, eventually serving administrative roles as dean of law at the University of Western Ontario, principal of McGill University, and president of the University of Waterloo. At the same time, Johnston involved himself with politics and public service, moderating political debates and chairing commissions in both the federal and provincial spheres, his most renowned position in that field being the chairmanship of the inquiry into the Airbus affair. He was in 2010 appointed as governor general by then monarch Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of then Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper, to replace MichaÃ«lle Jean as viceroy and he occupied the post until succeeded by Julie Payette in 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Johnston> .

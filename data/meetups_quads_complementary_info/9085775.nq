His stage name is derived from the South Park neighborhood in Houston, Texas where he was raised. Coy started his musical career in 1994. One year later, he, his brother Arthur, and one of their friends founded Dope House Records. Coy debuted as South Park Mexican that same year with the album Hillwood under the same label. In 2002, Coy was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and sentenced to 45 years incarceration, and is currently serving his sentence at the Ramsey Unit in Rosharon, Texas.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haiducii> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paula Mitrache (born June 14, 1977), known by the stage name Haiducii (Romanian pronunciation: [hajˈdutʃij]), is a Romanian-Italian singer, model and actress. She released her debut single \"Dragostea din tei\" in 2004, a cover of O-Zone's homonymous single of the previous year. A copyright infringement lawsuit followed on the matter and resulted in Haiducii paying fees for this confirmed charge. Commercially, \"Dragostea din tei\" reached widespread commercial success, reaching number 1 in Austria, Italy, Portugal and Sweden, as well as the top ten in eight other countries. It was also certified Gold and Platinum in several territories. In late 2004, Haiducii released \"Mne s Toboy Horosho\" and, in late 2005, \"More 'N' More (I Love You)\", her last singles that managed to hit the chart, reaching numbers 5 and 8 in Italy, respectively. Paula Mitrache in Haiducii, the singer's debut studio album, followed in 2008, which includes these first hit songs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haiducii> .

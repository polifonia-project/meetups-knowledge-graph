Slick was a key figure in San Francisco's early psychedelic music scene in the mid-1960s. With a music career spanning four decades, she first performed with The Great Society, but is best known for her work with Jefferson Airplane and the subsequent successor bands Jefferson Starship and Starship. Slick and Jefferson Airplane first achieved fame with their 1967 album Surrealistic Pillow, which included the top-ten Billboard hits \"White Rabbit\" and \"Somebody to Love\". She provided the lead vocals on both tracks. With Starship, she sang co-lead for two number one hits, \"We Built This City\" and \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\". She also released four solo albums. Slick retired from music in 1990, but continues to be active in the visual arts field. Slick was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 as a member of Jefferson Airplane." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grace_Slick> .

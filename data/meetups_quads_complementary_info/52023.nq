<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farouk_of_Egypt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Farouk I (/fəˈruːk/; Arabic: فاروق الأول Fārūq al-Awwal; 11 February 1920 – 18 March 1965) was the tenth ruler of Egypt from the Muhammad Ali dynasty and the penultimate King of Egypt and the Sudan, succeeding his father, Fuad I, in 1936. His full title was \"His Majesty Farouk I, by the grace of God, King of Egypt and the Sudan\". As king, Farouk was known for his extravagant playboy lifestyle. While initially popular, his reputation eroded due to the corruption and incompetence of his government. He was overthrown in the 1952 coup d'etat, and forced to abdicate in favour of his infant son, Ahmed Fuad, who succeeded him as Fuad II. Farouk died in exile in Italy in 1965. His sister, Princess Fawzia Fuad, was the first wife and consort of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farouk_of_Egypt> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Levin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anthony Frederick Levin (born June 6, 1946) is an American musician and composer, specializing in electric bass, Chapman Stick and upright bass. He also sings and plays synthesizer. Levin is best known for his work with King Crimson (since 1981) and Peter Gabriel (since 1977). He is also a member of Liquid Tension Experiment (1997–1999, 2008–2009, 2020–present), Bruford Levin Upper Extremities (1998–2000) and HoBoLeMa (2008–2010). He has led his own band, Stick Men, since 2010. A prolific session musician since the 1970s, Levin has played on over 500 albums. Some notable sessions include work with John Lennon, Sarah McLachlan, Paula Cole, Stevie Nicks, Pink Floyd, Paul Simon, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Joan Armatrading, Tom Waits, Buddy Rich, The Roches, Todd Rundgren, Seal, Warren Zevon, Bryan Ferry, Laurie Anderson, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Gibonni, and Jean-Pierre Ferland. Tony has also toured with artists including Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon (with whom he appeared in the 1980 film One-Trick Pony), Gary Burton, James Taylor, Herbie Mann, Judy Collins, Carly Simon, Peter Frampton, Tim Finn, Richie Sambora, Ivano Fossati, Claudio Baglioni and Lawrence Gowan. Levin helped to popularize the Chapman Stick and the NS upright bass. He also created \"funk fingers\", modified drumsticks that attach to the fingers of the player in order to strike the bass strings, adding a distinctive percussive \"slap\"\" sound used in funk bass playing. In 2011, Levin ranked # 2 behind John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin in the \"20 Most Underrated Bass Guitarists\" in Paste magazine. In July 2020, Levin was ranked #42 on the \"50 Greatest Bassists of All Time\" list by Rolling Stone magazine." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Levin> .

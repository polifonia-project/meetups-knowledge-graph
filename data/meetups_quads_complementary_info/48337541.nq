<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonita_Alizadeh> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sonita Alizadeh (Dari: سونیتا علیزاده; born 1996) is an Afghan rapper and activist who has been vocal against forced marriages. Alizadeh first gained attention when she released \"Brides for Sale,\" a video in which she raps about daughters being sold into marriage by their families. With the help of Rokhsareh Ghaem Maghami, an Iranian documentary filmmaker who over three years documented her story in the film Sonita, Alizadeh filmed the video to escape a marriage her parents were planning for her, even though it is illegal for women to sing solo in Iran, where she was living at the time. After releasing the video on YouTube, Alizadeh was contacted by the Strongheart Group, which offered her a student visa and financial help to come and study in the United States of America, where she then relocated and has resided since. In 2015, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonita_Alizadeh> .

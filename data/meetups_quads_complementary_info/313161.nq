<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dipendra_of_Nepal> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev (Nepali: दीपेन्द्र वीर विक्रम शाह, 27 June 1971 – 4 June 2001) was the King of Nepal for three days from 1 to 4 June 2001. For the duration of his three day reign he was in a coma after he shot his father, King Birendra, his mother, Queen Aishwarya, his younger brother and sister, and other members of the royal family before turning the gun on himself in an event known as the Nepalese royal massacre. As the eldest of the three children of King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya, Dipendra was the crown prince. Under the Nepalese constitution, the privy council named Dipendra king upon the death of his father. Upon Dipendra's death, his father's brother Gyanendra became king." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dipendra_of_Nepal> .

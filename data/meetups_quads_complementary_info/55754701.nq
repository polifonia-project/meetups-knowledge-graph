A member of the Democratic Party, he defeated Jackson Miller, the Republican House Majority Whip, to win the seat. Born in North Carolina, Carter is an IT specialist and a former U.S. Marine. In the House of Delegates, Carter served on the Finance Committee and the Militia, Police and Public Safety Committee. He is a self-proclaimed communist, the first such state delegate in the U.S. since 1929. In 2017, he was endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), of which he was a member, but later had a series of confrontations with the organization. As a Marine, Carter went to Kuwait and the Mediterranean. His unit, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit, was also one of the first to respond to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2021, Carter ran for governor of Virginia in the 2021 election. He came in fifth of the five candidates in the Democratic Primary with less than 3% of the vote, losing to Terry McAuliffe, and also lost the primary for renomination for his House seat." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_J._Carter> .

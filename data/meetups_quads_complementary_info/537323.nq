She first saw success in 1981 with her debut single \"Kids in America\", which peaked at No. 2 in the UK. In 1983, she received the Brit Award for Best British Female solo artist. In 1986, she had a UK No. 2 hit with a reworked version of the Supremes' song \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\", which also topped the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1987. Between 1981 and 1996, she had 25 singles that charted within the Top 50 of the UK Singles Chart. Her other hits include \"Chequered Love\" (1981), \"You Came\" (1988), and \"Never Trust a Stranger\" (1988). In 2003, she collaborated with Nena on the song \"Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime\", which topped the Dutch charts. Worldwide, Wilde has sold over 10 million albums and 20 million singles. She holds the record for being the most-charted British female solo act of the 1980s, with seventeen UK Top 40 hit singles.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burro_Banton> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Burro Banton (born Donovan Spalding; 27 December 1956 in Kingston, Jamaica) is a dancehall reggae deejay popular in the mid-1980s and 1990s. He is most famous for his anthem \"Boom Wah Dis\", which was recorded on the Steely & Clevie riddim called \"Street Sweeper\". Burro emerged during the mid-1980s at the beginning of the digital dancehall craze started by King Jammy that also featured artists like Cutty Ranks. He is known for his very aggressive style; deep, gruff voice; and was the inspiration for many modern dancehall artists like Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, and Elephant Man." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burro_Banton> .

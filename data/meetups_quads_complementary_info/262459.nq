<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rob_Halford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert John Arthur Halford (born 25 August 1951) is an English singer and songwriter. He is the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Judas Priest, which was formed in 1969 and has received accolades such as the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. He has been noted for his powerful and wide ranging operatic vocal style and trademark leather-and-studs image, both of which have become iconic in heavy metal. He has also been involved with several side projects, including Fight, Two, and Halford. AllMusic said of Halford, \"There have been few vocalists in the history of heavy metal whose singing style has been as influential and instantly recognizable... able to effortlessly alternate between a throaty growl and an ear-splitting falsetto.\" He was ranked at No. 33 on the list of greatest voices in rock by Planet Rock listeners in 2009. He has also been nicknamed \"Metal God\" by fans. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Judas Priest in 2022, via the Award for Musical Excellence." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rob_Halford> .

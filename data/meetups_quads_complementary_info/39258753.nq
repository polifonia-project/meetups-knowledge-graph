Vincent's broadcasting career spanned almost 30 years, from about 1960 through 1989. For much of that time, his program, \"The Art of Jazz,\" aired on FM radio stations in New Jersey and was heard throughout the New York metropolitan area. Vincent was known for his smooth, resonant voice and encyclopedic knowledge of jazz. He championed jazz as a unique American art form on a par with western classical music. A popular part of Vincent's radio broadcasts were his interviews with jazz greats, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles, Roy Eldridge, Duke Ellington, Tal Farlow, Art Farmer, Dizzie Gillespie, Jimmy Hamilton, Woody Herman, Richard \"Groove\" Holmes, Kenyon Hopkins, Stan Kenton, Gerry Mulligan, Peter Nero, Anita O'Day, Houston Person, Arthur Prysock, Lou Rawls, Don Sebesky, Jimmy Smith, Maxine Sullivan, Dr. Billy Taylor, Cal Tjader, Dinah Washington - and many others." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art_Vincent> .

He has been described as \"one of traditional music's few superstars of the post-War decades\" and one whose \"musical roots in Ireland can be identified back to the artisan musicians in the immediate aftermath of the famine, and he was an active musician from about 1906 until 1970.\" The accompanying book to the Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten lists Her Mantle So Green as one of the classic albums and The Factory Girl from Street Songs and Fiddle Tunes of Ireland with Margaret Barry is track 9 on the third CD in the set." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Gorman_(musician)> .

C-Bo, notoriously known for his relationship with law enforcement, was one of the first rappers to be jailed due to his lyrical content, a scathing critique of political officials, including governor Pete Wilson, California's Prop. 184 mandatory 25-life sentences for three strike felons, and police on his track \"Deadly Game\" written with rapper X-Raided in 1995. He unsuccessfully argued for appeal three times, while gaining nationwide attention for arguably his most successful mainstream album. Although some charges were dropped as it was viewed as a violation of his First Amendment rights, he was arrested in California in 1998, under the suspicion that his violent rap lyrics violated his parole. He rapped his court statement to the presiding judge, in Ohio, who gave C-Bo probation on the condition that he also rap in a Public Service Announcement. He also notably appeared in the California Love music video." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/C-Bo> .

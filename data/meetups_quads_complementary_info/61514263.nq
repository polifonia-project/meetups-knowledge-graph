Cabral released her debut album, Pantheon of Me, in September 2017; Pitchfork felt it was \"surely among the most overlooked debuts this calendar year\". Signing to Sacred Bones Records in 2018, she followed up in February 2019 with Mazy Fly. It was met with universal acclaim by music critics, who enjoyed the dark and eerie qualities of Spellling's sound. Cabral released the third full-length Spellling album, The Turning Wheel, on June 25, 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spellling> .

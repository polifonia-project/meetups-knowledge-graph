He also released , a solo album under his own name, in 1997. Charles lost his long battle with cancer on February 19, 2007, in Seattle, aged 54. The two other members of Sun City Girls, brothers Alan and Richard Bishop, embarked on a tour of the United States and Canada called \"The Brothers Unconnected\" in tribute to Charles' death, featuring showings of the man's video works and stripped-down, acoustic versions of selected Sun City Girls songs, including several tracks written by Gocher himself." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Gocher> .

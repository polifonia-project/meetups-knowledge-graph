His music (e.g., the songs \"Lilies in the Valley\" and \"The Here and After\") was used in the film Pina, nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature in January 2012. He has also been awarded by the German critic's award, Der Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik, as Best Album of the Year for his last three albums, \"Stolen from Strangers\", \"Lost Memory Theatre act-1\", and \"Lost Memory Theatre act-2\". Discovered by Japanese jazz trumpeter Terumasa Hino, Miyake started his career as a jazz trumpet player, having studied at Berklee College of Music from 1976 to 1981. In 1981, he won the prize at the Massachusetts Artist Foundation award for his composition. After returning to Tokyo, he became an influential artist, as well as a successful composer. Miyake has now released 27 solo albums, and has worked on films, documentaries, dances, advertisement, theatre pieces, and served as a producer for numerous artists. His main instruments include the trumpet, flugelhorn, melodica, piano, keyboard, fender rhodes, and programming. In 1983, he released his first album \"June Night Love\", which includes two tracks used in the TDK TV commercial starring Andy Warhol. He then continued on to working for over 3000 TV commercials, which led to winning many awards including Cannes advertisement film festival and the Digital Media Grands prix. Miyake has worked closely with Pina Bausch for pieces including Rough Cut (2005), Vollmond (2006), Sweet Mambo (2008), Como El Musguito En La Piedra, Ay Si Si... (2009), which led to the film Pina by Wim Wenders; his tracks were featured in the essential scenes. This film was awarded by European Film Award 2011 as Best Documentary; nominated for the Academy Awards 2012 as Best Documentary Feature,[4] and BAFTA 2012 as Best non-English language film. With Katsuhiro Otomo in 1995, he composed the soundtrack of the episode \"Stink Bomb\" for the anime Memories, where he uses a combination of jazz and funk to emphasize the film's chaotic and comedic nature. He has also worked closely with Robert Wilson on White Town (2002), an homage to Arne Jacobsen at Bellevue Teatret in Copenhagen; Jean-Paul Goude who has done the artwork for Stolen from Strangers, Lost Memory Theatre act-1, Lost Memory Theatre act-2, Oliver Stone, and Philippe Decouflé, among others, as well as collaborations with artists such as Hal Willner, Arto Lindsay, Peter Scherer, Arthur H, Vinicius Cantuaria, , David Byrne, Grace Jones, Gavin Friday, Nina Hagen, Ron Carter, Michael Brecker, David Sanborn, Al Foster, Dhafer Youssef, Vincent Segal, , Jean-Michel Jarre, and many others. With his ability to blend the most seemingly disparate element of music, he has achieved much respect throughout the world. From 2005, he has set a base in Paris, actively working on several projects. He has been selected as \"Man of 2009\" by Galeries Lafayette Homme. In 2016, he arranged the Japanese national anthem Kimigayo for 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony; composed the track \"ANTHEM OUTRO\" for the \"ARIGATO FROM JAPAN\" sequence." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jun_Miyake> .

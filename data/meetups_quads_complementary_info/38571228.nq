He has also toured with the hard rock band Firehouse and recorded their 2003 release Prime Time. He has been credited by the Brazilian media as the first Brazilian musician to play in a top hard rock band. Seixas has also toured with metal legend Stephen Pearcy of RATT, and is a current member of the bands Goodbye Thrill and Crown of Thorns. His stage presence and bass tricks have earned him the reputation of a \"not to miss\" performer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dario_Seixas> .

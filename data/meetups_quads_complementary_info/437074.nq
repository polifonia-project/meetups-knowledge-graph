<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Kochalka> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Kochalka (born May 26, 1967, in Springfield, Vermont) is an American comic book artist and writer, animator, and rock musician. His comics are noted for their blending of the real and the surreal. Largely autobiographical, Kochalka's cartoon expression of the world around him includes such real-life characters as his wife, children, cat, friends and colleagues, but always filtered through his own observations and flights of whimsy. In March 2011 he was declared the cartoonist laureate of Vermont, serving a term of three years." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Kochalka> .

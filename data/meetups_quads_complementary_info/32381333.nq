Lamar co-wrote \"Breathe\", a number one country and adult contemporary single by Faith Hill. Her songs have also been recorded by Sara Evans, Wynonna Judd, Lonestar, Tim McGraw, Jo Dee Messina and Jessica Simpson, among others. In 2002, Lamar was one of the first artists signed to Universal South. Between 2002 and 2003, she had two singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The first, \"These Are the Days\", was previously recorded by Jo Dee Messina on her 2000 album Burn. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard gave Lamar's version of the song a favorable review, calling it \"a solid song and a great performance that adds up to a promising debut from a new voice with a lot to say\". Her second single, \"Unkissed\", also received a positive review from Price, who described it as \"a shining calling card for a songwriter looking to make her own mark\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holly_Lamar> .

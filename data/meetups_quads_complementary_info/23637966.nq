<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrade_El_Idolo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Manuel Alfonso Andrade Oropeza (born November 3, 1989) is a Mexican professional wrestler who is currently signed to the American promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) under the ring name Andrade El Idolo (also stylized Andrade \"El Ídolo\"). He is also known for his appearances in Mexico for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and in Japan for New Japan Pro-Wrestling as La Sombra (Spanish for \"The Shadow\"), and for his appearances with the United States-based promotion WWE as Andrade \"Cien\" Almas (later shortened to simply Andrade). A third-generation professional wrestler, Andrade made his debut a month before his 14th birthday and worked under the name Brillante Jr. in reference to his father, who wrestled as Brillante. He spent eight years wrestling for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) under the name La Sombra, where he won the 2007 Torneo Gran Alternativa tournament and the 2011 Universal Championship and simultaneously held the Mexican National Trios Championship, NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship and CMLL World Tag Team Championship. He was one of the founding members of the los Ingobernables (\"the Ungovernables\") stable, and won the masks of El Felino, Olímpico and Volador Jr. by defeating them in Lucha de Apuestas matches before losing his own mask to Atlantis. Andrade also made appearances for New Japan Pro-Wrestling as part of a working agreement between CMLL and NJPW, winning the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Andrade joined WWE in 2015. He initially wrestled for its NXT brand under the ring name Andrade \"Cien\" Almas, winning the NXT Championship. In April 2018, he joined WWE's main roster where his ring name was shorted to simply \"Andrade\". Andrade held the WWE United States Championship for several months in 2019-2020. He departed WWE in March 2021, debuting in AAA and AEW that summer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrade_El_Idolo> .

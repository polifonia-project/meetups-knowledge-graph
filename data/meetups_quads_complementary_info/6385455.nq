<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ian_Kennedy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ian Patrick Kennedy (born December 19, 1984) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Arizona Diamondbacks, San Diego Padres, Kansas City Royals, Texas Rangers and Philadelphia Phillies. After honing a fastball from a young age, Kennedy was a standout for La Quinta High School in Westminster, California, and was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2003 MLB Draft. Kennedy turned down the Cardinals' offer in order to play college baseball for the University of Southern California. He was the USC Trojans' top-of-the-rotation starting pitcher as a freshman and was named the Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year as a sophomore. Though he slumped in his junior year, the Yankees selected Kennedy 21st overall in the 2006 MLB Draft. He quickly rose through the Yankees' farm system, making his major league debut the year after he signed with the team. Kennedy spent parts of three seasons with the Yankees, missing most of the 2009 season with an aneurysm in his arm. The Yankees traded Kennedy to the Diamondbacks in December 2009, and he quickly became the team's ace: after posting a 9–10 win–loss record in 2010, Kennedy was the National League wins leader in 2011. After making three consecutive opening day starts for Arizona, Kennedy was traded to the Padres at the 2013 trade deadline. He spent two strong seasons in San Diego before a hamstring issue soured his 2015 performance. He opted to become a free agent at the end of the year, then signed with the Royals. Injuries continued to plague him until the Royals moved him to the bullpen for the 2019 season. Although he was initially displeased with the decision, he found a new role as the team's closer, recording a league-leading 30 saves that season. Kennedy signed with the Rangers in 2021. He had expected to serve as the team's setup man but repeated his performance as closer after a series of injuries befell the bullpen. At the trade deadline, Kennedy and Kyle Gibson were part of a package sent to the Phillies in exchange for Spencer Howard. Kennedy then returned to the Diamondbacks for the 2022 season on a one-year deal." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ian_Kennedy> .

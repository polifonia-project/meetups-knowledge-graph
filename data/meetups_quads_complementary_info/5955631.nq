<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amfilohije,_Metropolitan_of_Montenegro> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Amfilohije (Serbian Cyrillic: Амфилохије; pronounced [amfilɔ̌xijɛ râːdɔv̞itɕ], English: Amphilochius; born Risto Radović, 7 January 1938 – 30 October 2020) was a bishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church, theologian, university professor, author and translator. He was first the bishop of Banat between 1985 and 1990, and then the metropolitan bishop of Montenegro and the Littoral from 1990, until his death. As the metropolitan bishop, he was the primate of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro. He was one of the most influential leaders of the Serbian Church, and was among the three candidates for the Serbian patriarchate (in 2010 when Irinej became patriarch). Amfilohije's honorary and liturgical title was: His Grace, Archbishop of Cetinje, Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral, of Zeta, Brda (the Highlands) and the Skenderija, and the Exarch of the Holy Throne of Peć. More than 569 churches and monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro were built or reconstructed during his reign. A noted theologian and author, his bibliography consists of more than 1,000 items and his selected works were published in 36 volumes. Amfilohije was described as one of the most powerful people in Montenegro, as well as one of most influential individuals within the Bishops' Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the supreme body of the Serbian Orthodox Church." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amfilohije,_Metropolitan_of_Montenegro> .

He began as a Latin pop artist and has recorded many ballads, but has released several successful reggaeton singles. Yatra is noted for his romantic lyrics, melding traditional lyricism with modern reggaeton influences. He rose to prominence in Latin America in 2016 when he released the hit \"Traicionera\". He has released three studio albums and recorded with artists from a diverse range of musical genres throughout his career. Born in Medellín and raised primarily in Miami, Yatra began singing at a young age and returned to Colombia to begin his musical career.

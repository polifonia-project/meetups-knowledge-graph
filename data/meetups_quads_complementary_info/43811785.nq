Chapman was signed to Curb Records. She charted five singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. Chapman was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the 1988 Academy of Country Music Awards. She was also nominated for Favorite Country New Artist at the American Music Awards of 1990. Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune gave Chapman's eponymous second album three stars out of four, calling her a \"straight-ahead singer\" who \"attacks almost any kind of song here with obvious personal involvement that is often stunning.\" The album also received a favorable review from People, which stated that it was \"characterized by intelligent song selection\" and that Chapman \"at times [sounds] like Cher gone down-home.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cee_Cee_Chapman> .

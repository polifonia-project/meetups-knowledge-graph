<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano_Red> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Willie Lee Perryman (October 19, 1911 â€“ July 25, 1985), usually known professionally as Piano Red and later in life as Dr. Feelgood, was an American blues musician, the first to hit the pop music charts. He was a self-taught pianist who played in the barrelhouse blues style (a loud percussive type of blues piano suitable for noisy bars or taverns). His performing and recording careers emerged during the period of transition from completely segregated \"race music\" to rhythm and blues, which was marketed to both white and black audiences. Some music historians credit Perryman's 1950 recording \"Rocking With Red\" for the popularization of the term rock and roll in Atlanta. His simple, hard-pounding left hand and his percussive right hand, coupled with his cheerful shout, brought him considerable success over three decades." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piano_Red> .

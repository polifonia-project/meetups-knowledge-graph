Fang has been nominated for multiple Golden Melody Awards, and won Best Lyricist at the 19th Golden Melody Awards for Jay Chou's \"青花瓷\" (Blue and White Porcelain) from On the Run. He is considered to be at the forefront of China Wind music, with his works often treated as poetry of artistic merit that garners high critical regard. In 1997, he sent samples of his lyrics to record companies, hoping to find a new career that complemented his passion for writing. Record company owner Jacky Wu was impressed with his work and hired Fang to work with Chou, who had just started his songwriting career. In 2000, Chou released his first album (titled Jay) and since then produced albums in which Fang contributes the majority of the lyrics. Chou's fame grew rapidly across Asia, pulling Fang into the limelight as well. Fang's lyrics are noted for covering a wide of issues from family to war, beyond what is normally discussed in love ballads. He is known for using a writing style similar to traditional Chinese poetry, making frequent references to Chinese history and folklore, esp. in Chinese style music (中國風), a fusion genre made popular in the 2000s (decade) by Jay Chou, fusing modern rock and contemporary R&B together with traditional Chinese music. He calls his style of lyrical poetry \"Su Yan Rhyme Poetry 素顏韻腳詩\", which has become a new poetry form in modern Chinese musical literature." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincent_Fang_(lyricist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Araya> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tomás Enrique Araya Díaz (Spanish pronunciation: [tom aˈɾaʝa]; born June 6, 1961) is a Chilean American musician, best known as the vocalist and bassist of American thrash metal band Slayer. Araya is ranked 58th by Hit Parader on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. Before Slayer was disbanded in 2019, Araya, along with Kerry King, were the only members who stayed in the band since its inception. Araya was employed as a respiratory therapist in the early 1980s and used his earnings to finance Slayer's debut album Show No Mercy (1983). Much of Araya's lyrical content is about serial killers, a subject he finds interesting; his first credited lyrical contribution was the vampire-themed track \"At Dawn They Sleep\" from 1985's Hell Awaits." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Araya> .

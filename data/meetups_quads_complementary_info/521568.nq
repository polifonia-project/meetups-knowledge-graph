<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edie_Sedgwick> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edith Minturn Sedgwick Post (April 20, 1943 â€“ November 16, 1971) was an American actress and fashion model, known for being one of Andy Warhol's superstars. Sedgwick became known as \"The Girl of the Year\" in 1965 after starring in several of Warhol's short films in the 1960s. She was dubbed an \"It Girl\", while Vogue magazine also named her a \"Youthquaker\". Sedgwick broke with Warhol in 1966, and attempted to forge an independent acting career. However, her mental health deteriorated from drug abuse, and she struggled to complete the semi-autobiographical film Ciao! Manhattan. She gave up drugs and alcohol after meeting her future husband Michael Post, and completed filming Ciao! Manhattan in early 1971. Post and Sedgwick married in July 1971; she died four months later of an overdose at age 28." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edie_Sedgwick> .

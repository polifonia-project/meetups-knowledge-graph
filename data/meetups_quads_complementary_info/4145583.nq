<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dallas_Smith> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dallas Hendry Smith (born December 4, 1977) is a Canadian singer and songwriter, who performs both as a solo country music artist and as lead singer for the hard rock band Default. He is currently signed to Big Loud Records. Smith is the current record holder of most #1 hits among all male Canadian artists on Billboard's Canada Country chart, at eleven. With Side Effects, Smith also became the first Canadian country artist in the Nielsen BDS era to chart four consecutive No. 1 singles from one album (Shania Twain charted three consecutive #1 hits from her 1997 release Come On Over), a feat he would then top with his next album, Timeless. At the end of 2012, Mediabase named Smith the most played Canadian country act and number eight overall at the format." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dallas_Smith> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosey_(wrestler)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Matthew Tapunu'u Anoaʻi (April 7, 1970 – April 17, 2017) was an American professional wrestler, best known for his time on the independent circuit under numerous ring names, and his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he competed as Rosey. Anoa‘i was a member of the Anoaʻi family, a renowned Samoan wrestling family. Anoa‘i, along with his late cousins Eddie Fatu and Matt Fatu, was trained at the Wild Samoan Training Facility headed by his uncle, Afa Anoaʻi. Following his training, he competed in Afa's World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. He began competing in tag team competition with Samu as the Samoan Gangsta Party. The team had a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Throughout the mid-1990s, Anoaʻi competed in various independent promotions and international promotions including World Wrestling Council and Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, winning various tag team championships. In 2001, Anoaʻi signed with the WWE and was assigned to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) in Cincinnati, Ohio. While situated at HWA, he was placed in tag team competition, alongside Fatu, and the duo won the HWA Tag Team Championship. After signing with WWE in 2002, Anoaʻi and Fatu were called up to the Raw roster. Known as 3-Minute Warning, they were utilized as enforcers for then-General Manager Eric Bischoff. Following the release of Fatu in 2003, Anoaʻi was \"discovered\" by The Hurricane and from there on they competed together as a team, known as The Hurricane and Rosey. After two years of teaming, they won the World Tag Team Championship, but disbanded shortly after losing the championship. Anoaʻi then did not resign his WWE contract in March 2006. Following his stint with WWE, Anoaʻi took time off to spend with his young children coaching his oldest sons teams. Anoa’i then continued his wrestling career, appearing at several independent promotions, including All Japan Pro Wrestling, Great Championship Wrestling, BAW Championship Wrestling, Appalachian Wrestling Federation, and Ohio Valley Wrestling. Aside from professional wrestling, Anoaʻi was a featured contestant on the reality television series Fat March where he lost 100 pounds but further injured his left knee. In his town of Milford, Ohio where he raised his children with his wife he decided to open and run a restaurant. The restaurant Island Boi BBQ was the first and only Polynesian restaurant in town. Anoa’i loved to give back to his community and would often take hot plates to feed the varsity football team. It was known as a hangout for some Cincinnati Bengals players who enjoyed the food. As Anoa’i’s health declined he closed his restaurant to focus on his health needs. A few years before his death, he returned to his own high-school town and opened EPIC Championship Wrestling out of Pensacola, Florida." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosey_(wrestler)> .

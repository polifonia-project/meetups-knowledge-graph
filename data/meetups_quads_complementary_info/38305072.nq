<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roe_Ethridge> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roe Ethridge is a postmodernist commercial and art photographer, known for exploring the plastic nature of photography â€“ how pictures can be easily replicated and recombined to create new visual experiences. He often adapts images that have already been published, adding new, sculpted simulations of reality, or alternatively creates highly stylized versions of classical compositions, such as a still life bowl of moldy fruit which appeared on the cover of Vice magazine, or landscapes and portraits with surprising elements. After participating in the 2008 Whitney Biennial, his work has been collected by several leading public museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Tate Modern. In 2010, his work was included in the MoMA's 25th Anniversary New Photography exhibit." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roe_Ethridge> .

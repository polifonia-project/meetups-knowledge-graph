<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Hartmann> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Johann Ernst Hartmann (His real name was Johann Hartmann, but due to a confusion with his elder son, who was also a composer, he became known by posterity as Johann Ernst Hartmann; 24 December 1726, Głogów, Bohemian Crown – 21 October 1793, Copenhagen) was a Danish composer and violinist. He is remembered in particular for his two operas on texts by Johannes Ewald in which he helped creating a national musical style. The first of these, Balders død, builds on the old Nordic mythology and uses dark colours when depicting the old Gods and Valkyries. The second, Fiskerne, describes contemporary fishermen’s lives, and uses melodies inspired by the Scandinavian folk style. Most of the works of Hartmann were destroyed in the fire of Christiansborg Castle shortly after his death. Two of Hartmann’s sons were composers, Johan Ernst Hartmann and August Wilhelm Hartmann, and a third, Ludvig August was a violinist. The composer Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann was the son of August Wilhelm Hartmann." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Hartmann> .

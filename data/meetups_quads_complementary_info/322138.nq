<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Green_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Allen Greenbaum (29 October 1946 â€“ 25 July 2020), known professionally as Peter Green, was an English blues rock singer-songwriter and guitarist. As the founder of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. Green founded Fleetwood Mac in 1967 after a stint in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and quickly established the new band as a popular live act in addition to a successful recording act, before departing in 1970. Green's songs, such as \"Albatross\", \"Black Magic Woman\", \"Oh Well\", \"The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)\" and \"Man of the World\", appeared on singles charts, and several have been adapted by a variety of musicians. Green was a major figure in the \"second great epoch\" of the British blues movement. Eric Clapton praised his guitar playing, and B.B. King commented, \"He has the sweetest tone I ever heard; he was the only one who gave me the cold sweats.\" His trademark sound included string bending, vibrato, and economy of style. In June 1996, Green was voted the third-best guitarist of all time in Mojo magazine. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked him at number 58 in its list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". Green's tone on the instrumental \"The Super-Natural\" was rated as one of the 50 greatest of all time by Guitar Player in 2004." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Green_(musician)> .

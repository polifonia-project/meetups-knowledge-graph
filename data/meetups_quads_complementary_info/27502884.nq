She is also a co-founder of the group Mocha Girls. Uson served as a member of the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) from January 2017 through her appointment as assistant secretary of the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) in May of the same year by Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte as a reward for her support in his presidential election campaign. She resigned from office on October 3, 2018, following a series of gaffes, though some insiders said she was dismissed by Malacañang. On September 30, 2019, it was announced that Duterte had appointed Uson as deputy executive director of the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), much to the outrage of Filipino netizens. Consequent to her risqué performances with the Mocha Girls and revealing personal photographs, including articles she authored with sexual content, Uson gained notoriety. Her critics have also brought into question her administrative competence, having propagated fake news and misinformation via her eponymous blog while in office, earning her the pejorative title \"Queen of Fake News\" from them." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mocha_Uson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Lee_(snooker_player)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen Lee (born 12 October 1974) is an English professional snooker player who is currently banned from the world snooker tour. He turned professional in 1992 and was ranked in the top 16 between the 1997–98 and 2007–08 snooker seasons, reaching a career-high of fifth in the rankings. He won five ranking titles, reached the semi-finals of the 2003 World Championship and the final of the 2008 Masters. Thereafter, his form declined and he dropped out of the top 16 after the 2007–08 season, meaning he would no longer automatically qualify for tournaments. A return to form in the 2011–12 season saw Lee win a fifth ranking title and regain his top 16 seeding. Lee is a strong break-builder, compiling 184 competitive century breaks during his career. His smooth cue action is regarded by some pundits as the most natural the game has seen. Lee was suspended from World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) competitions on 12 October 2012 on match-fixing charges. He was found guilty by an independent tribunal in September 2013 of influencing the outcome of seven matches in 2008 and 2009. He received a twelve-year ban that was backdated to the start of his suspension, which will run until 12 October 2024." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Lee_(snooker_player)> .

He was also known as a polymath, with knowledge in astronomy, geography, meteorology, botanics, cosmetics, culinary art, and fashion. His nickname \"Ziryab\", comes from the Persian word for jay-bird زرياب, pronounced \"Zaryāb\". He was also known as Mirlo ('blackbird') in Spanish. He was active at the Umayyad court of Córdoba in Islamic Iberia. His first achieved fame, was at the Abbasid court in Baghdad, Iraq, his birthplace, as a performer and student of the great Persian musician and composer, Ibrahim al-Mawsili. Ziryab was a gifted pupil of Ibrahim al-Mawsili in Baghdad, where Ziryab got his beginner lessons. He left Baghdad during the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun and moved to Córdoba, where he was accepted as court musician in the court of Abd ar-Rahman II of the Umayyad Dynasty." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ziryab> .

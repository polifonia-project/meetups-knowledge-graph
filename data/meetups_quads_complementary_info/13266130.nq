Smith, is an English record producer, songwriter and musician. Some of the singles he collaborated on include Adele's \"Set Fire to the Rain\", James Morrison's \"Broken Strings\", Tinchy Stryder's \"Number 1\" and Taio Cruz's \"Break Your Heart\". In 2016, Smith teamed up with Stormzy to produce his debut album Gang Signs & Prayer, which won Best Album at the 2018 Brit Awards. Earlier that year he produced seven tracks on Kano's Made in the Manor album and co-produced the debut EP from South London rapper Dave. Smith has also worked with Sam Smith. Smith released his debut album, 12 Questions, on 30 October 2020. The record is based on a series of 12 questions all born of Smith’s own anxieties about the world, discussing issues such as faith, freedom, race, gender, wealth, equality and ecology. Smith collaborated with Dave, Kano, Ghetts, Bastille, Idris Elba and Stormzy. On 18 March 2021, Smith was presented with a RSL (Rockschool Ltd) Fellowship. In August 2021, Dave and Smith were nominated for the Ivor Novello Awards 2021 in the Best Contemporary Song category for \"Children of the Internet\". Dave and Smith subsequently won. This was their third Ivor Novello win in four years. The song is performed by Future Utopia. This was producer Smith’s new project and features Dave and Es Devlin." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fraser_T._Smith> .

Regarded as the “Grand slam Queen,” she ruled both television and movies with a steady stream of blockbuster hits and top-rated shows in a career spanning over five decades, earning her a rightful place in the industry's upper echelon. Tolentino has starred in over 80 films throughout her career, including her memorable portrayals in Moral (1982), Narito Ang Puso Ko (1993) and Somewhere (1984). She has won 6 FAMAS Awards (including 3 Best actress wins), 4 FAP Awards, a Gawad Urian Award and a Golden Screen Award. Tolentino is the widow of actor Rudy Fernandez. Together they had two children, one, the actor Renz Fernandez. As a child star, she used the screen name, Giselle in the movie of the same title with Chiquito playing her adoptive father. As an adult actress, Seven Stars productions re-launched her in Miss Dulce Amor, Ina (popular novel in Liwayway Magazine) in 1978." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorna_Tolentino> .

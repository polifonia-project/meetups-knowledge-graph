He performed gospel in his local church from an early age. Following an audition for jazz musician Bobbi Humphrey in 1988, Campbell was signed to Warner Bros. Records. In 1989, Campbell collaborated with Quincy Jones performing lead vocals for \"Tomorrow\" on Jones' album Back on the Block and released his Platinum-selling debut album, T.E.V.I.N. The album included his highest-charting single to date, \"Tell Me What You Want Me to Do\", peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The debut album also included the singles \"Alone With You\" (produced by Al B. Sure and Kyle West, with background vocals by K-Ci and JoJo from Jodeci), and \"Goodbye\". His double-Platinum-selling second album, I'm Ready, released in 1993, included two high-charting songs penned by Babyface; \"Can We Talk\" peaked at number 9 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on the Billboard R&B charts, and the album's title track \"I'm Ready\", which also peaked at number 9 on the Hot 100. In 1996, Campbell released his third album, Back to the World, which was not as commercially or critically successful as his first two releases. His fourth and most recent album, Tevin Campbell, was released in 1999, but performed poorly on Billboard's album charts. Apart from music, Campbell commenced an acting career, by appearing in the sequel to Prince's Purple Rain named Graffiti Bridge and made guest appearances on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Moesha television programs, voiced fictional pop star Powerline in Disney's A Goofy Movie and was cast as Seaweed in the Broadway musical Hairspray in 2005. Campbell earned 5 Grammy Award nominations, and he has certified sales of 5 million records in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tevin_Campbell> .

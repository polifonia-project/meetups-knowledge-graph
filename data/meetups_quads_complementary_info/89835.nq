Her signature songs are the 1966/67 hit \"Society's Child (Baby I've Been Thinking)\" and the 1975 Top Ten single \"At Seventeen\", from her LP Between the Lines, which in September 1975 reached no. 1 on the Billboard album chart. Born in Farmingdale, New Jersey, Ian entered the American folk music scene while still a teenager in the mid-1960s. Most active musically in that decade and the 1970s, she has continued recording into the 21st century. She has won two Grammy Awards, the first in 1975 for \"At Seventeen\" and the second in 2013 for Best Spoken Word Album, for her autobiography, Society's Child, with a total of ten nominations in eight different categories. Ian is also a columnist and science fiction author." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Janis_Ian> .

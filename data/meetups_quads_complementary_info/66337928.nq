He had multiple singles that have been placed in the UK Singles Chart; his mixtape albums Double Tap Diaries and Made In The Pyrex, reached No. 11 and 3 on the UK Albums Chart, respectively. His third mixtape, Noughty By Nature was released on 15 April 2022, debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart. He gained recognition as part of the UK drill collective 1011 which was later renamed to CGM. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of the UK drill scene. He is the founder of his current record label, Black Money Records (BMR) and managed by Groundworks. Some of his music videos have garnered attention among law enforcement, resulting in a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) taken against the collective, and he has been in and out of prison during the singles and videos' releases. Digga D was sent to prison three times before the age of 20." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Digga_D> .

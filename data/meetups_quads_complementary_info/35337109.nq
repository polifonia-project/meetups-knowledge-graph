<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Doyle_(jazz_vocalist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Glen \"Bobby\" Doyle (August 14, 1939 â€“ July 30, 2006) was an American singer, bassist, and pianist. He is best known for his early work with a young Kenny Rogers and for a brief stint with Blood, Sweat & Tears. He played piano on two tracks on BS&T's 1972 album New Blood. Doyle joined the doo-wop group The Spades (later The Slades) in 1957 while still at McCallum High School in Austin. In 1960 he formed The Bobby Doyle Three with Don Russell and standup bass player Kenny Rogers, then a student at the University of Texas. Rogers soon dropped out of college to join Doyle full-time, singing high harmony and playing bass on the 1962 album In A Most Unusual Way. The group appeared at clubs across the country including the New York Playboy Club in 1962. The trio disbanded in 1965, and Rogers went on to become a country-pop sensation. Doyle continued as a solo artist, releasing multiple singles and albums including an appearance on the soundtrack for the 1971 film Vanishing Point. In the 1980s, Doyle on piano, Rick Moses on bass and William Walton on drums, backed Brunswick recording artist Sunny Nash. In the mid-1990s, Rogers (now a long established superstar) reunited with Doyle and Russell as part of a special concert called \"Going Home\" where Rogers sang a selection of his greatest hits and favorite songs. The original Bobby Doyle Trio line-up performed \"It's A Good Day\" with Doyle on lead vocals. Doyle was born blind as a result of his mother contracting German measles during pregnancy. An operation in 1959 to restore his sight, paid for by his high school friends, was unsuccessful." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Doyle_(jazz_vocalist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bergen_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bergen (born Belgin Sarılmışer; 15 July 1958 – 14 August 1989) was a Turkish singer. She broke the sales record with her album, Acıların Kadını. Bergen has become one of the symbols and faces of violence against women in Turkey with her life and death. Her personal life was influential in her gloomy sound and led to her success. Her husband threw nitric acid on her face resulting in blindness in her right eye. After that, she continued singing and chose to cover the blind eye with her long hair. She was murdered by her ex-husband, whom she divorced after releasing several successful albums." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bergen_(singer)> .

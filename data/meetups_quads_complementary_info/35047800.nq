He is a pioneer of electronic music and the use of computers and synthesizers in music in Romania, with a science fiction touch. He also plays guitars, keyboards and programmable instruments. His first mainstream success was the 1992 album The Secret of Pyramids, followed by At The Gates of Love in 1993 and Sweet Freedom in 1994. The whole work (102 minutes) appeared unified on a double CD (the first of this kind in Romania) in 1995." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Octave_(musician)> .

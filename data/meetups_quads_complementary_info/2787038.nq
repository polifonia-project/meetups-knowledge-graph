<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Wolfgang> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Walter Jakob Wolfgang (23 June 1923 â€“ 28 May 2019) was a German-born British socialist and peace activist. Up to the time of his death, he was Vice-President of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Vice Chair of Labour CND, a caucus of CND members who are also members of the Labour Party. He was also a supporter of the Stop the War Coalition. Walter became better known to the general public after cameras recorded him being forcibly ejected from the annual Labour Party Conference in Brighton on 28 September 2005, aged 82, for shouting \"nonsense\" during Jack Straw's speech in which the then Foreign Secretary extoled the virtues of the government's role in the Iraq War. The eviction of Walter Wolfgang provoked much media comment and embarrassed the Labour leadership. The following morning he was re-admitted to conference to a stand up ovation and an apology from the chair of the session. In August 2006, Wolfgang succeeded in his bid to become a member of Labour's National Executive Committee. He died in May 2019 at the age of 95." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Wolfgang> .

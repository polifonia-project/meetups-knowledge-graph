<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billy_Paul> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul Williams (December 1, 1934 â€“ April 24, 2016), known professionally as Billy Paul, was a Grammy Award-winning American soul singer, known for his 1972 No. 1 single \"Me and Mrs. Jones\", as well as the 1973 album and single War of the Gods, which blends his more conventional pop, soul, and funk styles with electronic and psychedelic influences. He was one of the many artists associated with the Philadelphia soul sound created by Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell. Paul was identified by his diverse vocal style, which ranged from mellow and soulful to low and raspy. Questlove of the Roots equated Paul with Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, calling him \"one of the criminally unmentioned proprietors of socially conscious post-revolution '60s civil rights music.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billy_Paul> .

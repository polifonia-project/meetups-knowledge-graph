Her material contains elements of both traditional and contemporary country-pop music. Pearce began performing professionally in her teens, appearing on several albums of bluegrass material in the 2000s. After moving to Nashville, Tennessee, she began gaining more widespread notice. Pearce first gained major recognition in 2017 when her self-penned \"Every Little Thing\" found an audience on satellite radio. The song helped Pearce secure a major label recording contract and became a major hit, reaching number one on the Billboard country chart. Her debut album of the same name debuted in the top five of the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Pearce has since released new material, including the 2020 single \"Next Girl\" from 29, an EP released on February 19, 2021. On September 17, 2021, she released her third studio album 29: Written in Stone. Pearce is a three-time Country Music Association Award winner, a four-time Academy of Country Music Award winner, has received one CMT Music Award and became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carly_Pearce> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavis_Smiley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tavis Smiley (/ˈtævɪs/; born September 13, 1964) is an American talk show host and author. Smiley was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, and grew up in Bunker Hill, Indiana. After attending Indiana University, he worked during the late 1980s as an aide to Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles. Smiley became a radio commentator in 1991 and, starting in 1996, he hosted the talk show BET Talk (later renamed BET Tonight) on Black Entertainment Television (BET). After Smiley sold an exclusive interview of Sara Jane Olson to ABC News in 2001, BET declined to renew his contract that year. Smiley then began hosting The Tavis Smiley Show on National Public Radio (NPR) (2002–04) and hosted Tavis Smiley on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) on weekdays and The Tavis Smiley Show on Public Radio International (PRI) from 2004 until 2017. Smiley's career suffered repercussions after he was suspended and later fired from PBS after an investigation during the Me Too movement found that he was guilty of widespread sexual misconduct and sexual harassment. He sued PBS for wrongful termination and lost the court case after the jury found he violated the company's moral clause. The judge ordered Smiley pay PBS $2.6 million in damages." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tavis_Smiley> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jake_LaMotta> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Giacobbe \"Jake\" LaMotta (July 10, 1922 â€“ September 19, 2017) was an American professional boxer who was world middleweight champion between 1949 and 1951. Nicknamed \"The Bronx Bull\" or \"Raging Bull\", LaMotta was a rough fighter who was not a particularly big puncher, but would subject his opponents to vicious beatings in the ring. With the use of constant stalking, brawling and inside fighting, he developed a reputation for being a \"bully\"; he was what is often referred to today as a swarmer and a slugger. Due to his hard style of fighting, LaMotta often took as much as he dished out in an era of great middleweights. With a thick skull and jaw muscles, LaMotta was able to absorb incredible amounts of punishment over the course of his career, and is thought to have one of the greatest chins in boxing history. LaMotta's six-fight rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson was one of the most notable in the sport. Although each fight was close and LaMotta dropped Robinson to the canvas multiple times, LaMotta won only one of the bouts. LaMotta, who lived a turbulent life in and out of the ring, was managed by his brother Joey. He was ranked 52nd on Ring Magazine's list of the \"80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years\", and also ranked amongst its list of the 10 greatest middleweights of all time. LaMotta was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990. LaMotta's autobiography was adapted into the 1980 Martin Scorsese film Raging Bull. It went on to be nominated for eight Academy Awards, with Robert De Niro winning Best Actor for his portrayal of LaMotta." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jake_LaMotta> .

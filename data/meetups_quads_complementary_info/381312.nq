<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Carradine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Carradine (/ˈkærədiːn/ KARR-ə-deen; born Richmond Reed Carradine; February 5, 1906 – November 27, 1988) was an American actor, considered one of the greatest character actors in American cinema. He was a member of Cecil B. DeMille's stock company and later John Ford's company, best known for his roles in horror films, Westerns, and Shakespearean theatre. In the later decades of his career, he starred mostly in low-budget B-movies, but continued to also appear in higher-profile fare. In total, he holds 351 film and television credits, making him one of the most prolific English-speaking actors of all time. Carradine was married four times, had five children, and was the patriarch of the Carradine family, including four sons and four grandchildren who are or were also actors." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Carradine> .

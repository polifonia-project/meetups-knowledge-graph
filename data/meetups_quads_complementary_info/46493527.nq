Vogel (May 16, 1863 â€“ January 1, 1951) was an American manager and owner of African-American minstrel companies in the United States. By the end of the 19th century, Vogel was a prominent non-playing manager. He continued to run minstrel companies after many other companies had dissolved . By 1901, Vogel had been proclaimed the \"Minstrel King,\" by commentators of that era." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_W._Vogel> .

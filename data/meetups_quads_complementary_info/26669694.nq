<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Welsman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frank Squire Welsman (20 December 1873 â€“ 2 July 1952) was a Canadian conductor, pianist, composer and music educator. He began his career as a concert pianist, but ultimately earned his place in Canadian history for establishing Toronto's first symphony orchestra of any standing, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (no relation to the current orchestra of that name) which was active from 1906 to 1918. As a composer he wrote a few songs and some instrumental pieces, mostly works for solo piano. His grandson John Welsman is a notable film score composer and his granddaughter Carol Welsman is a successful jazz pianist and singer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Welsman> .

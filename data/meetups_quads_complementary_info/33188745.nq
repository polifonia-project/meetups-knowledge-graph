<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laura_Kenny> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dame Laura Rebecca Kenny, Lady Kenny DBE OLY (n√©e Trott; born 24 April 1992) is a British track and road cyclist who specialises in track endurance events, specifically the team pursuit, omnium, scratch race, elimination race and madison disciplines. With six Olympic medals, having won both the team pursuit and the omnium at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics and madison at the 2020 Olympics, along with a silver medal from the team pursuit at the 2020 Olympics, she is both the most successful female cyclist, and the most successful British female athlete, in Olympic history. Her husband, fellow British track cyclist Sir Jason Kenny, holds the same national and Olympic achievement on the male side, and together they are the most successful married couple in Olympic history where both spouses have won at least one gold medal (with 12 gold and three silver medals between them). Since first appearing at the European Track Championships in 2010, she has won seven World Championship, 14 European Championship and two Commonwealth Games titles, as part of a total of 34 medals. On the road, Kenny won the British National Road Race Championships in 2014, taking the under-23 title in the same race, but has not competed since 2015." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laura_Kenny> .

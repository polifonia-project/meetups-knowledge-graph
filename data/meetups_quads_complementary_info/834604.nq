<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Hui> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Samuel Hui Koon-kit (born 6 September 1948), usually known as Sam Hui, is a Hong Kong musician, singer, songwriter and actor. He is credited with popularising Cantopop both via the infusion of Western-style music and his usage of vernacular Cantonese rather than written vernacular Chinese in biting lyrics that addressed contemporary problems and concerns. Hui is considered by some to be the first major superstar of Cantopop, known as the God of Song. As an actor, he is well-known for portraying the main character \"King Kong\" in five installments of Aces Go Places film series." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Hui> .

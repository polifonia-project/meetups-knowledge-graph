<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Athey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ron Athey (born December 16, 1961) is an American performance artist associated with body art and with extreme performance art. He has performed in the U.S. and internationally (especially in the UK and Europe). Athey's work explores challenging subjects like the relationships between desire, sexuality and traumatic experience. Many of his works include aspects of S&M in order to confront preconceived ideas about the body in relation to masculinity and religious iconography." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Athey> .

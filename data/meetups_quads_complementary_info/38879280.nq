She auditioned as a solo act for the American television series The X Factor in 2012, after which she became a member of the girl group Fifth Harmony, which went on to become one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. While in Fifth Harmony, Normani competed in Dancing with the Stars (2017) and released her first song outside of the group \"Love Lies\" (2018), a duet with Khalid. The song peaked in the top ten in the US, was certified 5× platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and is tied as the longest charting song by a female artist on the Mainstream Top 40 chart. Following Fifth Harmony's indefinite hiatus, Normani released a two-song EP with Calvin Harris, Normani x Calvin Harris (2018). That same year, she released the single \"Waves\" featuring 6lack, which won Normani the MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video. Her duet with Sam Smith \"Dancing with a Stranger\" (2019), is one of the most-streamed songs by a female artist in the United Kingdom, and earned her a nomination for Song Of The Year at the Brit Awards. In August 2019, Normani released her first solo single, \"Motivation\". The following year, Normani released \"Diamonds\" with Megan Thee Stallion for Birds of Prey: The Album. In July 2021, Normani released \"Wild Side\", featuring Cardi B, which reached the top 20 in the US." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normani> .

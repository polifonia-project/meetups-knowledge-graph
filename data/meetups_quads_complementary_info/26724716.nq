<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eleftheria_Eleftheriou> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eleftheria Eleftheriou (Greek: Ελευθερία Ελευθερίου; Greek pronunciation: [elefθeˈri.a elefθeˈri.u]; born 12 May 1989) is a Greek-Cypriot singer, musician, and actress. She came to prominence through her participation in the second season of the Greek version of The X Factor. Shortly after her elimination, Sony Music Greece signed her and submitted her as a candidate to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. She was later disqualified from the national final, following the leak of her song onto the internet by an unknown party. Eleftheriou had previously participated in the Cypriot national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with the song \"Play That Melody To Me\" featuring Maria Zorli, finishing seventh in the final. Eleftheriou represented Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, with the song \"Aphrodisiac\", where she placed 17th (9th on the televoting)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eleftheria_Eleftheriou> .

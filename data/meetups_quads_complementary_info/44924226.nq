<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Leclerc> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Marc Hervé Perceval Leclerc (French pronunciation: ​[ʃaʁl ləklɛʁ]; born 16 October 1997) is a Monégasque racing driver, currently racing in Formula One for Scuderia Ferrari. He won the GP3 Series championship in 2016 and the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2017. Leclerc made his Formula One debut in 2018 for Sauber, a team affiliated with Ferrari, for which he was part of the Ferrari Driver Academy. With Sauber having finished last the year before, Leclerc led the charge to improve its finishing position in the constructors' championship to eighth, and was the higher ranked of the two Sauber drivers. He joined Ferrari the next season and became the second-youngest driver to qualify on pole position in Formula One at the 2019 Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2019 season also saw Leclerc take his first career win in Belgium. He won the FIA Pole Trophy for most pole positions in the 2019 season, becoming the youngest driver to win it, before winning it again in 2022. As of the 2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Leclerc has achieved 5 race wins and 18 pole positions in Formula One. He scored the first grand slam of his career at the 2022 Australian Grand Prix. Leclerc is set to remain at Ferrari until at least the end of the 2024 season." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Leclerc> .

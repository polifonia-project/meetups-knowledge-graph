Originally from Montreal, he sings in both French and English, and is currently residing in Montreal again, after a stint in Vancouver, British Columbia. He recently completed a tour with The One AM Radio and Lymbyc Systym. Sometimes referred to as a \"laptop musician\", he received a grant from the to record and catalogue orchestra instruments. He uses the database—with the sounds sometimes looped and processed—in his live performances, along with his own keyboard playing. On his 2005 album Alone, Not Alone, he collaborated with hip hop music producer Sixtoo. His 2007 album, Going Places, includes collaborations with M83, Ida Nilsen, Ghislain Poirier, Final Fantasy and Amy Millan. For the title track, he spliced together sounds that fans from around the world had sent in to him; he credits 70 contributors. An openly gay man, Bédard's song \"Best Boy Electric\" is a boy-on-boy duet that tells of the romance that prompted his move to Vancouver. He won a 2008 Jessie Award for Outstanding Sound Design or Original Composition, for his contribution to a production of 4.48 Psychosis. In 2012, Montag will release one single a month, all released by Carpark Records. Each single will be accompanied by a music video." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montag_(musician)> .

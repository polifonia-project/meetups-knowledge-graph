<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thierry_Mugler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Manfred Thierry Mugler (French pronunciation: ​[manfʁɛd tjɛʁi myɡlɛʁ]; 21 December 1948 – 23 January 2022) was a French fashion designer, creative director and creative adviser of Mugler. In the 1970s, Mugler launched his eponymous fashion house; and quickly rose to prominence in the following decades for his avant-garde, architectural, hyperfeminine and theatrical approach to haute couture. He was one of the first designers to champion diversity in his runway shows, which often tackled racism and ageism, and incorporated non-traditional models such as drag queens, pornstars, and transgender women. In 2002, he retired from the brand, and returned in 2013 as the creative adviser. At the beginning of his career he designed signature looks for Michael Jackson, Madonna, Grace Jones, David Bowie and Diana Ross; most notably Demi Moore's dress from the 1993 movie Indecent Proposal, which was once coined \"the most famous dress of the 1990s\". In 1992, he directed and designed the outfits for George Michael's \"Too Funky\" music video; also that year he launched the perfume Angel, which became one of the best-selling perfumes of the 20th century. Mugler's fall 1995 haute couture collection, marking the 20th anniversary of his brand, was staged at the Cirque d’Hiver venue in Paris; and has been referred to as the \"Woodstock of Fashion\", for having over 300 designed looks, an elaborate set design, dozens of high-profile supermodels and a performance from James Brown. He also designed costumes for Beyoncé's I Am... World Tour, and created a one-off design for Kim Kardashian to wear to the 2019 Met Gala." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thierry_Mugler> .

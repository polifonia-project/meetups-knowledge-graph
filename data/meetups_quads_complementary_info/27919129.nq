<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guido_Crepax> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Guido Crepas (15 July 1933, in Milan â€“ 31 July 2003, in Milan), better known by his pen name Guido Crepax, was an Italian comics artist. He is most famous for his character Valentina, created in 1965 and very representative of the spirit of the 1960s. The Valentina series of books and strips became noted for Crepax's sophisticated drawing, and for the psychedelic, dreamlike storylines, generally involving a strong dose of erotism. His work was often politically motivated too, inspired by his Communist convictions. A film based on his work called Baba Yaga, featuring the character Valentina, was made in 1973." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guido_Crepax> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naruhito> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Naruhito (徳仁, pronounced [naɾɯꜜçi̥to]; born 23 February 1960) is the current Emperor of Japan. He acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne on 1 May 2019, beginning the Reiwa era, following the abdication of his father, Akihito. He is the 126th monarch according to Japan's traditional order of succession. Naruhito was born in Tokyo as the eldest child of Akihito and Michiko, then crown prince and crown princess of Japan. He became the heir apparent upon his father's accession as Emperor on 7 January 1989, following the death of Emperor Shōwa, and was formally invested as crown prince in 1991. He attended Gakushūin schools in Tokyo and later studied history at Gakushuin University and English at Merton College, Oxford. In 1993, he married Harvard graduate and diplomat Masako Owada, with whom he has one daughter: Aiko, Princess Toshi (born 2001). Continuing his grandfather's and father's boycott over the enshrinement of convicted war criminals, he has never visited Yasukuni Shrine. Naruhito is interested in water policy and water conservation, and likes to play viola. He was an honorary president of the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics and is a supporter of the World Organization of the Scout Movement." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naruhito> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ella_Mae_Morse> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ella Mae Morse (September 12, 1924 â€“ October 16, 1999) was an American singer of popular music whose 1940s and 1950s recordings mixing jazz, blues, and country styles influenced the development of rock and roll. Her 1942 recording of \"Cow-Cow Boogie\" with Freddie Slack and His Orchestra gave Capitol Records its first gold record. In 1943, her single \"Get On Board, Little Chillun\", also with Slack, charted in what would soon become the R&B charts, making her one of the first white singers to do so. Morse stopped recording in 1957 but continued to perform and tour into the 1990s. In 1960 she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ella_Mae_Morse> .

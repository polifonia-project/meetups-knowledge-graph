Following the release of her debut single \"I Want You in My Movie\", she was recruited by Jazzie B to join a newly reformed line-up of R&B group Soul II Soul. Managed by her bandmate, Jazzie B, the group became one of London's best-selling groups of all time. Their second album, Vol. II: 1990 â€“ A New Decade (1990), which achieved gold-status in the US and UK, featured the top-charting single \"A Dream's a Dream\" with Wilson-James on lead vocals. Following her exit from the group at the end of 1990, she released her debut solo album, Perseverance (1991), which contained hits \"Through\" and \"Bright Lights\".

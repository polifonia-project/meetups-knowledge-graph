Two years later, he recorded the album Confio Em Ti (I Trust in Thee). His discography also includes the work No Caminho do Milagre (\"On the Path of the Miracle\"), recorded live, and Às Margens do Teu Rio (At the Margins of Thy River), in 2012. Beside the singer , Davi was lead singer of groups and Trazendo a Arca. He worked for four years at Toque no Altar and another four in Trazendo a Arca, leaving both to devote to his solo career. Some of their songs caused controversy among Christian for his anthropocentric lyrics. The artist is married to Veronica Sacer, who accompanies him on his travels and events, and sings a duet with him. Together, the couple has two children, Breno and Maressa. Davi Sacer is a member of Apascentar Church in Nova Iguaçu, located in the city of Nova Iguaçu." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Davi_Sacer> .

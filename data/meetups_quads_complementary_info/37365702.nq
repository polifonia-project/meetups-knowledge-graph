<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_O'Neill_(harpist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Arthur O'Neill (1726 or 1734 – 1816) was an Irish harper, a virtuoso player of the Irish harp or cláirseach: he was active during the final decades of its unbroken instrumental tradition in the later 18th and very early 19th century. He was closely associated with Edward Bunting, and the Belfast Harp Society's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preserve the instrument, attending the Belfast Harper's Assembly and serving as the Society's harp tutor until 1813. He is best known for his lively and humorous memoir, collected by Bunting, which contained many reminiscences of famous harpers (such as Carolan) and of the environment in which they played." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_O'Neill_(harpist)> .

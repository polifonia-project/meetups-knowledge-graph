<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Moore_(American_football)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Edward Moore (born November 11, 1969) is a retired American football player who over the span of his 15-year career (1992â€“2006) with the National Football League played for the Miami Dolphins, the Buffalo Bills, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Moore played as a tight end and fullback. His last official game was the Pro Bowl in 2007 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Moore didn't miss more than two games in any season for his entire Buccaneers career since first joining the team in 1993. At the time of his retirement, he was the fourth tight end in NFL history to play 200 career games. In fact, before him, only 206 NFL players had accomplished this feat in the entirety of the National Football League's existence. During his career he had a rate of one touchdown scored for every 7.7 passes caught, which was the best touchdown rate by any player in Buccaneer history who had at least 50 career receptions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Moore_(American_football)> .

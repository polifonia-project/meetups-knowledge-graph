Prior to his appointment to this role in 1865 he established his reputation as an organist, composer, and musician. During his tenure at the University of Edinburgh he founded a number of university musical societies across Scotland, most notably the Edinburgh University Music Society, and successfully resolved the university's Reid School of Music into a Faculty able to award degrees to its graduates. He socialized with and mentored contralto, composer, and festival organizer Mary Augusta Wakefield." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbert_Oakeley> .

In her later years, she learned from Sudha Raghunathan and currently from Suguna Purushotthaman. She used to participate in school competitions and in one such competition which she won, A. R. Rahman who distributed the prizes invited the winners to his studio to record their voices. Subsequently, she was called by Suhasini Maniratnam to sing \"Nila Kaigirathu\" for her first film Indira.

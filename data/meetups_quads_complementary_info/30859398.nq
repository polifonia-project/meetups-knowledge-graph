She started her career at the age of eight, joining the Russian children's act Avenue, soon after that joining Neposedy. In 1999, producer Ivan Shapovalov chose Katina and Julia Volkova for his project t.A.T.u. The duo would later become Russia's most successful pop music act. The group produced several hits, including \"All the Things She Said\", \"Not Gonna Get Us\", and \"All About Us\".Their first single, \"All the Things She Said\", peaked at No. 1 in nineteen countries, including the UK, Russia, and Australia. In 2009, Katina began a solo career, which caused t.A.T.u. to go on hiatus. In 2011, the duo officially split, with Volkova also pursuing a solo path. That year, Katina released her first mainstream single, \"Never Forget\", which reached No. 1 on the MTV Russia Top 10 and also won the MTV Russia – 2011 Video of the Year. The track also reached No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play and rose to first place in Greece. In 2014, Katina released her debut album, This Is Who I Am, which was reissued in Spanish under the name Esta Soy Yo two years later. In 2019, she released her second album, Mono." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lena_Katina> .

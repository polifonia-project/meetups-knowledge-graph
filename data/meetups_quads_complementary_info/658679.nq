<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shemp_Howard> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Samuel Horwitz (March 11, 1895 – November 22, 1955), known professionally as Shemp Howard, was an American actor and comedian. He was called \"Shemp\" because \"Sam\" came out that way in his mother's thick Litvak accent. He is best known as the third Stooge in the Three Stooges, a role he played when the act began in the early 1920s (1923–1932), while it was still associated with Ted Healy and known as \"Ted Healy and his Stooges\"; and again from 1946 until his death in 1955. During the fourteen years between his times with the Stooges, he had a successful solo career as a film comedian, including series of shorts by himself and with partners. He reluctantly returned to the Stooges as a favor to his brother Moe and friend Larry Fine to replace his brother Curly as the third Stooge after Curly's illness." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shemp_Howard> .

Watt is a professor at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. With Peter Mosses he developed action semantics, a combination of denotational semantics, operational and algebraic semantics. He currently teaches a third year programming languages course, and a postgraduate course on algorithms and data structures. He is recognisable around campus for his more formal attire compared to the department's normally casual dress code." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Watt_(computer_scientist)> .

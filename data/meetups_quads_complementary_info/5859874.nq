<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_West> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Keith Hopkins (born 6 December 1944, Dagenham, Essex, England), known by his stage name Keith West, is a British rock singer, songwriter and music producer. He is best known for his single \"Excerpt from A Teenage Opera\" (\"Grocer Jack\"), which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. West was also the lead singer of various groups including Tomorrow, a 1960s psychedelic rock band. West wrote most of his own songs (credited to Keith Hopkins), often in collaboration with Ken Burgess. Despite critical acclaim and support from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who featured Tomorrow on his The Perfumed Garden show, the group was not a major commercial success." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_West> .

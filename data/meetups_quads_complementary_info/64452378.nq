<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saifuddin_Saif> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Saifuddin Saif (20 July 1922 â€“ 12 July 1993) was a Pakistani lyricist, poet, film producer-director, and the founder of Rehnuma Films, a film studio of 1954. He was involved in writing poems and lyrics before and after the Partition. However, most of his films written before partition remained unreleased due to political instabilities in the subcontinent. He was best known for his film Kartar Singh, and is also credited for writing lyrics for Pakistan's historical and first-ever feature film Teri Yaad, which helped him to appear among the prominent writers. As a poet, he wrote eleven gazals and four nazms on various subjects, including fifteen on friendship, fifteen on social, one on hope, and a poetic book titled Kham-e-Kakul, also known as Khan-e-Kamal (amazing ruler)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saifuddin_Saif> .

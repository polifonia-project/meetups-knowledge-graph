<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vince_Neil> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vincent Neil Wharton (born February 8, 1961), best known by the stage name Vince Neil, is an American musician. He is the lead vocalist and occasional rhythm guitarist of heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, which he fronted from their 1981 formation until his departure in 1992. Neil reunited with the band in 1996 and continued with them until the band's 2015 retirement, and again from the band's 2018 reunion onwards. Outside of Mötley Crüe, Neil has also released three studio albums as a solo artist – the most recent of which, Tattoos & Tequila, was released in 2010. Although his later life has seen media focus more on his poor live performances and off-stage controversy, Neil's aesthetic and singing voice are still considered synonymous with the American glam metal movement of the 1980s. \"You wouldn't take any other life advice from them,\" wrote People Magazine, \"but the heavy metal rockers sure had style.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vince_Neil> .

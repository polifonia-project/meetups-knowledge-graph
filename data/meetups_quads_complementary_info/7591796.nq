<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeanne_Little> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeanne Mitchell OAM (11 May 1938 – 7 November 2020), professionally known as Jeanne Little, was an Australian entertainer, comedienne and television personality who won the Gold Logie award in 1977 (a dual honour that year with Don Lane winning as Best Male Personality). Her first success on television was on The Mike Walsh Show which earned her the Gold Logie plus two other Logies. Other television of appearances include Midday with Ray Martin and GMA with Bert Newton. She became well known for her flamboyant outfits, over-the-top personality and her trademark catch phrase said in a drawling speech of \"Oh Dahling\". She was a regular panel member on the talk show Beauty and the Beast, during the tenure of \"Beasts\" Stan Zemanek and Doug Mulray. She became known internationally after appearing on Sir Michael Parkinson's eponymous chat show. Her success transferred to cabaret and theatre when she landed roles on Jerry's Girls, Legends and Marlene – A Tribute to Dietrich." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeanne_Little> .

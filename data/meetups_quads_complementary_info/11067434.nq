<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_O'Hara> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary O'Hara (born 12 May 1935) is an Irish soprano and harpist from County Sligo. She gained attention on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Her recordings of that period influenced a generation of Irish female singers who credit O'Hara with influencing their style, among them Carmel Quinn, Mary Black, and Moya Brennan. In his autobiography Memoirs of an Irish Troubadour (2002), Liam Clancy wrote how her music inspired and influenced him and others of the Folk Revival period." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_O'Hara> .

He released many CDs, LPs and cassettes, and was regarded as one of the most important noise musicians of his time. He did not like to term his work \"music,\" preferring the term \"design\": \"I don't think of myself as a musician or an artist. I'm a designer. I therefore consider my sound works to be designs as well\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aube_(musician)> .

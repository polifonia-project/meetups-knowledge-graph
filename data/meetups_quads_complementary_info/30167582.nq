Born in Camberley, Surrey, Goddard was spotted singing at a talent contest at the age of 14. From 2007 she featured on three consecutive winter tours of the United States and Canada with American band Trans-Siberian Orchestra and performed a duet on \"Child of the Night\", a track from the band's 2009 album Night Castle. In March 2010, Goddard created a YouTube channel with the username \"AlexaMusicTV\". She uploaded to this channel various videos of her own covers of R&B hits. She released four cover versions as singles, using social media such as Twitter to promote them. The biggest-selling of these was her version of \"Turn My Swag On\", which charted at Number 20 on the UK Singles Chart and Number One on the UK Indie Chart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexa_Goddard> .

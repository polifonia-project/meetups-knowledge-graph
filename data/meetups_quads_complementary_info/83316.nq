<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Davies> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Raymond Douglas Davies CBE (/ˈdeɪvɪs/ DAY-viss; born 21 June 1944) is an English musician. He was the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and main songwriter for the rock band the Kinks, which he led with his younger brother Dave on lead guitar and backing vocals. He has also acted in, directed, and produced shows for theatre and television. Known for focusing his lyrics on English culture, nostalgia, and social satire, he is often referred to as the \"Godfather of Britpop\", though he disputes this title. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Kinks in 1990. After the dissolution of the Kinks in 1996, he embarked on a solo career." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Davies> .

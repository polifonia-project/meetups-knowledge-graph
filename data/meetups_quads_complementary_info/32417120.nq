Sbtrkt has remixed songs by artists such as M.I.A, Radiohead, Modeselektor, Basement Jaxx, Mark Ronson, and Underworld, and has released singles, EPs, and two albums. His music has been playlisted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 6 Music. Sbtrkt also has performed live with frequent collaborator Sampha. The live show from 2010 to 2012 consisted of Jerome utilizing synthesisers, keyboards, drums and drum programming with Sampha on vocals and keyboards. Jerome uses the project's title rather than his own name in order to support the concept of anonymity. Jerome has explained \"[I'd] rather not talk about myself as a person, and let the music speak for itself. The name SBTRKT is me taking myself away from that whole process. I'm not a social person, so having to talk to DJs to make them play a record is not something I want to do. It's more about giving them a record as an anonymous person and seeing whether they like it or not. If they play it, they play it.\" Sbtrkt wears modern interpretations of native society ceremonial masks designed by the anonymous designer \"A Hidden Place\". In March 2016, Sbtrkt announced a new project described as a 'non album'. The collection of songs and project is designed to bring new tracks to fans sooner than album cycles and also be a continuous ongoing experience. In June 2022, Sbtrkt announced that new music would be released later in the year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sbtrkt> .

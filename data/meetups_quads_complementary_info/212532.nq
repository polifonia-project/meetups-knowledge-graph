<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derren_Brown> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Derren Brown (born 27 February 1971) is an English mentalist, illusionist, painter, and author. He began performing in 1992, making his television debut with Derren Brown: Mind Control in 2000, and has since produced several more shows for stage and television. His 2006 show Something Wicked This Way Comes and his 2012 show Svengali won him two Laurence Olivier Awards for Best Entertainment. He made his Broadway debut with his 2019 stage show Secret. He has also written books for both magicians and the general public. Brown does not claim to possess any supernatural powers; conversely, his acts are often designed to expose the methods of those who do assert such claims, such as faith healers and mediums. He often begins live performances by stating that his results are achieved through \"magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection, and showmanship\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derren_Brown> .

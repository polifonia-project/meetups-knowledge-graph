<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sin_Cara> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jose Jorge Arriaga Rodriguez (born September 5, 1977) is a Mexican-American professional wrestler currently working on the Mexican independent circuit, under the ring name Cinta de Oro (Spanish for \"Golden Ribbon\"). He is best known for his time with WWE under the ring name Sin Cara (Spanish for \"Faceless\"), where he was the second and longest-tenured wrestler to use the persona. Prior to his signing with WWE, he wrestled under the ring name Místico or Mystico (Spanish for \"Mystic\") under which he worked for Mexican professional wrestling promotion AAA and various independent promotions in the United States and Mexico. During this time, CMLL wrestler Místico grew in popularity, and since CMLL originally owned the legal rights to the character, Arriaga had to change his ring name to Místico de Juarez and later to Incognito, under which he wrestled in promotions like Chikara, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, and the National Wrestling Alliance. Arriaga signed with WWE in 2009 and debuted on the main roster in 2011 as Sin Cara, temporarily replacing the original performer of the character, who coincidentally was also Luis Urive. Following the return of Urive, the two began a storyline, with Arriaga donning a black mask, and was referred to on commentary as Sin Cara Negro. Arriaga subsequently lost a Mask vs. Mask match against Urive and began wrestling unmasked under the ring name Hunico. In 2013, after the release of Urive, Arriaga reprised his role as Sin Cara. In contrast to Urive, Arriaga's portrayal of Sin Cara was bilingual due to Arriaga having grown up in the United States, thus knowing how to speak both Spanish and English, and doing so depending on the intended audience, whereas Urive legitimately did not know English. In September 2014, Arriaga won the NXT Tag Team Championship alongside Kalisto as a part of The Lucha Dragons. He departed the company in December 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sin_Cara> .

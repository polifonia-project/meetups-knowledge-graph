<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Terry_(saxophonist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Andrew Alexander \"Mike\" Terry (July 18, 1940 â€“ October 30, 2008) was an American saxophonist, songwriter, arranger, producer and musical director. His baritone sax solos feature on the breakthrough hits of Martha and the Vandellas (\"Heat Wave\", 1963), and The Supremes (\"Where Did Our Love Go\", 1964). As a member of the Funk Brothers he performed on thousands of Motown recordings from 1960 to 1967, including at least seven US #1 hits. As was Motown's policy at the time, none of the studio musicians were credited by name. Terry was the musical arranger of the 1966 hit \"Cool Jerk\" by The Capitols, and later became a record producer, with partners including George Clinton, Sidney Barnes, and Jack Ashford." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Terry_(saxophonist)> .

She was born in Streetly, Staffordshire, England and studied piano privately and horn at the Birmingham Conservatoire (formerly the Birmingham School of Music) before reading music at Birmingham University, graduating with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1960.Master of Arts [Birmingham University] 1968 After completing her studies, she took a position teaching music with the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Her music has been performed internationally. She is one of the women pioneers in electronic music composition in Great Britain for her earliest musique concrete pieces belong to the late 1950s. Daphne Oram was helpful and encouraging here. The influences on her music are diverse and include non-European music as well as the sounds of nature and industry. The use of music technology allowed her to make sonic explorations and the use of microtonality. These influences also enriched her writing for acoustic instruments as in \"Study of the Object no 3\" (1970) for unaccompanied voices, a graphic score she calls sound sculpture, \"Mestra\" (1979â€“80) for solo flutes and \"Hunting Horns are Memories\" (1977) for horn and tape for which she worked out quarter tone fingerings for the F/B flat double horn. The passage of time also intrigues her and she has experimented with polymetric and polytempi music. Janet Beat is included in the British Music Collection archive at Heritage Quay, Huddersfield. She is an Honorary Research Fellow of the School of Culture & Creative Arts at the University of Glasgow and an Affiliate of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery as a Curatorial Consultant." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Janet_Beat> .

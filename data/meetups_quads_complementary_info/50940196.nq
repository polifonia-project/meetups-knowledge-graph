<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacob_Collier> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jacob Collier (/ˈkɒliər/; né Moriarty; born 2 August 1994) is an English singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. His music incorporates a combination of jazz with elements from many other musical genres, and often features extensive use of reharmonisations and close harmony. He is also known for his energetic live performances, in which he often conducts the audience to sing multiple-part harmonies or percussions. In 2012, his split-screen video covers of popular songs, such as Stevie Wonder's \"Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing\", began to go viral on YouTube. In 2014, Collier signed with Quincy Jones's management company and began working on his one-man, audio-visual live performance vehicle, designed and built at the MIT Media Lab by Ben Bloomberg. In 2016, Collier released his debut album, In My Room, which he recorded, arranged, performed and produced himself in the small back room of his family home in Finchley, North London. In 2017, Collier was awarded Grammy Awards for his arrangements of \"Flintstones\" and \"You and I\". In 2018, Collier began working on Djesse, a four-volume, 50-song album featuring more than two dozen artists and ensembles. The first volume, which features the Metropole Orkest, Djesse Vol. 1, was released in December 2018. The second, Djesse Vol. 2, uses more acoustic instrumentation, and was released in July 2019. In 2020, Collier won Grammy Awards for his arrangements of \"All Night Long (All Night)\" from Djesse Vol. 1 and \"Moon River\" from Djesse Vol. 2. In 2021, he won a Grammy Award for \"He Won't Hold You\" from the third volume, Djesse Vol. 3. Collier is the first British artist to receive a Grammy Award for each of his first four albums." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacob_Collier> .

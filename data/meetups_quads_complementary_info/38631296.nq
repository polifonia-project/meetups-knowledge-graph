Chumlee went to work at the pawn shop five years before filming the first season, having been a childhood friend of Corey Harrison whose father and grandfather founded the shop. Chumlee is often portrayed on the show as the comic foil, but he often appraises items in his areas of expertise, including pinball machines, sneakers, and video games." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chumlee> .

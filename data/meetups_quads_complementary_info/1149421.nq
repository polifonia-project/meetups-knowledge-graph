James Neufeld wrote in his book Passion to Dance. The National Ballet of Canada \"Veronica Tennant has built a major career and impressive artistic reputation almost entirely within the National Ballet of Canada.

She wrote two children books: the first, On stage, Please : A Story illustrated by Rita Briansky (published in 1977) and the second, The Nutcracker illustrated by the former figure skater Toller Cranston (published in 1985) based on the story of E.T.A.

Repka (born October 22, 1960) is an American graphic artist, best known for creating album covers for metal bands as well as shirt designs, including those featuring Megadeth's mascot Vic Rattlehead. Repka's portfolio also includes Dark Angel's logo and model designs for the Hellraiser films. He works for the National Entertainment Collectibles Association as their lead painter and head of art direction. Repka's artwork based on the original Universal Studios film The Wolf Man was used as the cover art for the first issue of horror magazine HorrorHound. Repka admits that despite being known as the \"King of Thrash Metal Art,\" he is not a big fan of the genre. He is more into the punk genre like the Misfits." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_Repka> .

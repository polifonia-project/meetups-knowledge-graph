<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kreng_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kreng is a Belgium-based project formed by Pepijn Caudron (born 1975). Initially Kreng was a strictly sample-based project, incorporating sounds from various sources: dark jazz, new electronic generated sounds, classical modernism and vintage geographical recordings. The project became a very cinematic, theatrical device that has been used by various directors. Kreng has now scored more than 50 theatre and dance productions, most of them produced by Abattoir Ferm√©. Kreng has also been involved in some collaborative projects with various members of the Belgian musical underground. Among them Kaboom Karavan, Bart Maris and Eric Thielemans." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kreng_(musician)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Jones> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alexander Emerick Jones (born February 11, 1974) is an American far-right and alt-right radio show host and prominent conspiracy theorist. He hosts The Alex Jones Show from Austin, Texas, which the Genesis Communications Network broadcasts across the United States (syndicated and internet radio). Jones's website, InfoWars, promotes conspiracy theories and fake news, as do his other websites NewsWars and PrisonPlanet. Jones has provided a platform and support for white nationalists, giving Unite the Right rally attendee and white supremacist Nick Fuentes a platform on his website Banned.Video, as well as serving as an \"entry point\" to their ideology. The conspiracy theories promoted by Jones alleged that the United States government either concealed information about or outright falsified the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the September 11 attacks, and the 1969 Moon landing. He has claimed that several governments and big businesses have colluded to create a \"New World Order\" through \"manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech and—above all—inside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria\". A longtime critic of Republican and Democratic foreign and security policy, Jones supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential bid and continued to support him as a savior from an alleged criminal bipartisan cabal controlling the federal government, despite falling out over several of Trump's policies including airstrikes against the Assad regime. A staunch supporter of Trump's reelection, Jones supported the false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election and, on January 6, 2021, was a speaker at a rally in Lafayette Square Park supporting Trump, preceding the attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. In 2022, for Jones' defamatory falsehoods about the Sandy Hook shooting, juries in Connecticut and Texas have awarded over $1.4 billion in damages respectively from Jones to families of Sandy Hook shooting victims and a first responder; they had alleged that Jones' lies led to them being threatened and harassed for years. On August 4, 2022, a Texas court ordered $4.1 million in compensatory damages, and $45.2 million in punitive damages the following day. In the second defamation case in Connecticut, a judge awarded the eight families $965 million in compensatory damages on October 12, 2022, and on November 10, 2022, $473 million in punitive damages in the form of lawyers' fees. The judge also issued an order that he was \"not to transfer, encumber, dispose or move his assets out of the United States until further order of the court.\" On December 2, 2022, Jones filed for personal bankruptcy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Jones> .

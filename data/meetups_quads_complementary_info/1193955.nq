<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McGeoch> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Alexander McGeoch (25 August 1955 â€“ 4 March 2004) was a Scottish musician and songwriter. He is best known as the guitarist of the rock bands Magazine (1977-1980) and Siouxsie and the Banshees (1980-1982). He has been described as one of the most influential guitarists of his generation. In 1996 he was listed by Mojo in their \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" for his work on the Siouxsie and the Banshees song \"Spellbound\". Signature characteristics of his playing style included inventive arpeggios, string harmonics, the uses of flanger and an occasional disregard for conventional scales. He was also a member of the bands Visage (1979-1980), the Armoury Show (1983-1986) and Public Image Ltd (1986-1992). McGeoch has been cited as an influence by guitarists including Johnny Marr, Roddy Frame, Jonny Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, the Edge, John Frusciante, Steve Albini, Duane Denison, and Dave Navarro." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McGeoch> .

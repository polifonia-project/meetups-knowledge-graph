<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reyes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ron Reyes (born July 24, 1960) is an American musician most noted as the second singer for the Los Angeles punk rock group Black Flag. Reyes joined Black Flag after original vocalist Keith Morris had quit to form the Circle Jerks. Black Flag needed a singer to go on a tour to Vancouver, Canada, and asked Reyes to fill in. Reyes is the singer on the Jealous Again EP, and is the vocalist in the film The Decline of Western Civilization. He left the band due to the violence at Black Flag shows. 33 years after leaving the band, Reyes reunited with Black Flag in 2013 for an album, the band's first in 28 years, and tour followed that same year with Reyes being fired mid-show during a performance in Australia. Reyes started his band Piggy in 2011. And also was the guest lead vocalist for Whidbey Island Washington's POTBELLY on a split 7-inch with Montana's Bath Salts Brigade in 2018. He performed only once with Potbelly." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Reyes> .

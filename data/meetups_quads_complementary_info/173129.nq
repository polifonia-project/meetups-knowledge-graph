<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Erykah_Badu> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Erica Abi Wright (born February 26, 1971), known professionally as Erykah Badu (/ˈɛrɪkə bɑːˈduː/), is an American singer-songwriter, record producer and actress. Influenced by R&B, soul, and hip hop, Badu rose to prominence in the late 1990s when her debut album Baduizm (1997), placed her at the forefront of the neo soul movement, earning her the honorific nickname \"Queen of Neo Soul\" by music critics. Badu's career began after she opened a show for D'Angelo in 1994 in Fort Worth; leading to record label executive Kedar Massenburg signing her to Kedar Entertainment. Her first album, Baduizm, was released in February 1997. It spawned four singles: \"On & On\", \"Appletree\", \"Next Lifetime\" and \"Otherside of the Game\". The album was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her first live album, Live, was released in November 1997 and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA. Her second studio album, Mama's Gun, was released in 2000. It spawned three singles: \"Bag Lady\", which became her first top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #6, \"Didn't Cha Know?\" and \"Cleva\". The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Badu's third album, Worldwide Underground, was released in 2003. It generated three singles: \"Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)\", \"Danger\" and \"Back in the Day (Puff)\" with 'Love' becoming her second song to reach the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #9. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA. Badu's fourth album, New Amerykah Part One, was released in 2008. It spawned two singles: \"Honey\" and \"Soldier\". New Amerykah Part Two was released in 2010 and fared well both critically and commercially. It contained the album's lead single \"Window Seat\", which led to controversy. Badu's voice has been compared to jazz singer Billie Holiday. Early in her career, Badu was recognizable for her eccentric style, which often included wearing very large and colorful headwraps. She was a core member of the Soulquarians. As an actress, she has played a number of supporting roles in movies including Blues Brothers 2000, The Cider House Rules and House of D. She also has appeared in the documentaries Before the Music Dies and The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Erykah_Badu> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avicii> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tim Bergling (Swedish: [ˈtɪmː ˈbæ̂rjlɪŋ]; 8 September 1989 – 20 April 2018), known professionally as Avicii (/əˈviːtʃi/, Swedish: [aˈvɪ̌tːɕɪ]), was a Swedish DJ, remixer and music producer. At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal. He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single \"Levels\". His debut studio album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top 10 in more than 15 countries and topped international charts; the lead single, \"Wake Me Up\", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States. In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avīci (01). His catalog also included the singles \"I Could Be the One\" with Nicky Romero, \"You Make Me\", \"X You\", \"Hey Brother\", \"Addicted to You\", \"The Days\", \"The Nights\", \"Waiting for Love\", \"Without You\" and \"Lonely Together\". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on \"Sunshine\" with David Guetta in 2012 and \"Levels\" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s. Bergling retired from touring in 2016, after several years of stress and poor mental health. On 20 April 2018, he committed suicide while on holiday in Muscat, Oman. In 2019, his third and final album, Tim, was released posthumously." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Avicii> .

D.'s Basement Party. They toured in France, Belgium and the Netherlands in 1991 and then released a CD called \"Sketches of Belgium\" the next year, a reference to Miles Davis's \"Sketches of Spain\". The album, the first edited by De Werf, included an instrumental cover of Sting's Roxanne as well as two songs written by Thelonious Monk. In 1995 Defoort composed (with Fabrizio Cassol) the Variations on a Love Supreme. Defoort took part in the Octurn project in 1996 (he had already composed their 1994 album) and began to play with Mark Turner. A year later he recorded with Aka Moon on Elohim. He then formed a new ensemble. He also has his own quartet with Mark Turner (tenor saxophone), Nicolas Thys (bass guitar and double bass) and Jim Black (drums)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kris_Defoort> .

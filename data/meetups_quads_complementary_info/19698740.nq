Anastasia finished the Moscow Central Music School (eleven classes) at the Moscow Conservatory named after P. I .Tchaikovsky (1996), and graduated from the postgraduate courses at the same institution (1999), consistently following the traditional Russian Method.The creative formation of the young musician was greatly influenced by meetings with outstanding musicians: Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, Mstislav Rostropovich (lessons and master classes), who distinguished Anastasia's unusual aptitude.Chebotareva was sixteen when she had her international debut with tours in Italy, UK, France and Germany. Anastasia became a soloist of the Moscow State Philharmonic when she was a second-year student of the Moscow Conservatory." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anastasia_Chebotareva> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joyce_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joyce Moreno (born 31 January 1948), commonly known as Joyce (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈʒojsi]), is a Brazilian singer-songwriter and guitarist. The first record of her work as a singer dates back to 1964, when she participated in a vocal quartet in a studio recording of the album Sambacana, by Pacífico Mascarenhas. Four years later, she released her first solo album, Joyce, on the Philips label, signing alone the authorship of five of the ten songs on the album, in addition to a partnership with musician Jards Macalé.[2][3] She has since produced 45 more discs and two DVDs, has written nearly 400 songs, and also has four nominations for the Latin Grammy Awards (2000, 2004, 2005 and 2010). Since the beginning of her career, her trademarks have been a feminine language in the first person and her guitar skills. [3][4][5]As a composer, Joyce Moreno has songs recorded by nearly all the greatest names in Música popular brasileira—including Elis Regina, Maria Bethânia, Gal Costa, Milton Nascimento, Edu Lobo and Elizeth Cardoso—and by such foreign artists as Annie Lennox, Omara Portuondo, Claus Ogerman, the Black Eyed Peas, Gerry Mulligan, and Wallace Roney.[6] Her creations are also featured in two film soundtracks: Robert Altman's 1992 The Player and Robert Luketic's Legally Blonde.[7]She participated on the soundtrack of Japanese anime series Wolf's Rain, for which her work was included as part of the official soundtrack." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joyce_(singer)> .

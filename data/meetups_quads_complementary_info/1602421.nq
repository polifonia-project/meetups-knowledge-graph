<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_X> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Philips, better known by his stage name Richard X, is a British songwriter and music producer. Gaining attention as a pioneer of the bootleg craze, Richard X has earned success as a producer and remixer. He has helmed hit singles for artists including Annie, Kelis, Liberty X, Rachel Stevens and Sugababes. According to an early issue of the now defunct Popworld magazine, Philips' alias comes from a postcard which was sealed with a kiss misinterpreted for the letter X. Richard X is known for his \"synthesised, grungy pop music\", which was inspired by bands such as The Human League and Kraftwerk. His original intention was to \"reinvent\" pop music by making records that are \"deliberately unplayable\". Referring to his 'Girls on Top' bootlegs, Richard X says, \"At the time it was inspired by anti the po-facedness of the electronica scene as much as anything. The production side, how it sounded – rough and spiky, electronic and modern – was what did it for me. Taking pop and putting it through a blender sound wise was the spirit of the times.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_X> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ulises_Humala> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ulises Humala Tasso (born 2 March 1959 in Lima) is a Peruvian professor at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería and a politician who ran unsuccessfully for president in the 2006 election on the Avanza País ticket. He was running against his brother, Ollanta Humala, and 18 other candidates. Ulises received 0.2% of the vote, coming in 14th place. Like his brother Ollanta, Ulises Humala considers himself to be a nationalist. However, he claims to be less radical. He also considers the current 1993 constitution, produced in the \"Democratic Constitutional Congress\" after Alberto Fujimori's self-coup and during the Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992, to be illegal. One of his other brothers, Antauro Humala, is currently in prison for leading a failed military rebellion. The other brother, Ollanta Humala, served as the 65th President of Peru." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ulises_Humala> .

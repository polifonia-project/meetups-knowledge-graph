Referred to as the \"Queen of C-Pop\", she is considered one of the most influential figures in Chinese popular culture. She is known for her continual reinvention and versatility in musical style and visual image, and she has achieved great reputation and popularity in the Chinese-speaking world. She maintains control of every aspect of her career, and she is regarded as a key figure in popularizing dance-pop as mainstream music in Greater China. Her works, which incorporate social themes, have generated both commercial success and critical acclaim. In 1998, Tsai won a television singing competition produced by MTV Mandarin. Her debut album 1019 (1999) made her become an instant hit, and her first girl-next-door incarnation made her a teen idol with a huge teenage fanbase. Her album Magic (2003), which reflected her first musical reinvention, marked the beginning of her dance-oriented musical direction. Her album Dancing Diva (2006), which highly impressed the public with slick dance songs and dazzling dance moves, established her representative status as a dance-pop artist in the Chinese music scene. In 2009, Tsai founded the company Eternal and began to be completely in charge of her career. Her album Myself (2010) was regarded as one of the most experimental albums in the Chinese music industry. Her album Muse (2012) integrated pop music with pop art and spans mainstream and indie. Her album Play (2014), which incorporated various social themes, further thrust her into the international spotlight. Her album Ugly Beauty (2018), which explores the norm of beauty standard and the bipolarity of human feelings, was considered the leading production in the C-pop music industry. With sales of over 25 million records, Tsai is the best-selling Taiwanese female recording artist since 2000. Beginning with her 2003 album Magic, each of Tsai's studio albums has been the highest-selling album by a female artist in Taiwan in its year of release, with four of these albums also being the highest-selling album in the country overall in their respective years of release. She has received a total of seven Golden Melody Awards, making her the female dance-pop artist with the most wins. She is one of the highest-paid Taiwanese female artists, and she has featured multiple times on the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list. In 2014, Next Magazine reported that her estimated net worth exceeded NT$2 billion." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jolin_Tsai> .

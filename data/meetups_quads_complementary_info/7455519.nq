He has also drummed for the bands Armageddon, Majestic, Pestilence, Silver Seraph, Arch Enemy, Time Requiem, Soilwork, Gardens of Obscurity and Dawn of Oblivion amongst others. He has been tagged to perform sessions drums on Old Man's Child's latest album, Slaves of the World. He is the drummer/harsh vocalist of the James LaBrie solo records Static Impulse and Impermanent Resonance. He also joined the experimental metal trio Electrocution 250 along with Todd Duane and Lalle Larson, with which released the album Cartoon Music from Hell. He received his first drumset when he was 7. When he was nine he started to play the flute at the local music school (Kommunala musikskolan) where he learned how to read sheet music. After a year of playing the flute he quit and decided to take drum lessons instead. In 1986 he joined a brass band. He stayed with this band for 8 years. At the age of 14 he created his first rock band named \"Dammer\", which was later changed to \"Zaninez\". In 1989 Christopher Malmstr√∂m joined the band Zaninez and he and Peter became friends. This friendship would later help to form Darkane. He also auditioned for Dream Theater in 2010. He competed along with 6 others, who the band called \"the worlds greatest drummers\". The band was openly impressed with his audition, going as far as to name him in their Top 3 favorites, along with Mike Mangini (who was hired as the band's new drummer), Virgil Donati, Aquiles Priester, Derek Roddy, Thomas Lang and Marco Minnemann." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Wildoer> .

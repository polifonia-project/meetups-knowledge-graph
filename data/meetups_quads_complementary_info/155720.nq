<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiffany_Darwish> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tiffany Renee Darwish (born October 2, 1971), known mononymously as Tiffany, is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and former teen icon. Her 1987 cover of the Tommy James and the Shondells song \"I Think We're Alone Now\" spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and was released as the second single from her debut studio album Tiffany. Her singles \"Could've Been\" and \"I Saw Him Standing There\", a cover version of the Beatles' \"I Saw Her Standing There\", followed soon after, with the former also claiming the No. 1 position on the Billboard Hot 100. Thanks to an original mall tour, \"The Beautiful You: Celebrating The Good Life Shopping Mall Tour '87\", Tiffany found commercial success; and both her singles and the album peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200 charts, respectively. Although Tiffany's second studio album, Hold an Old Friend's Hand, featured a Top 10 single, charted in the upper register of the Billboard 200 in 1988, and ultimately became platinum-selling, it failed to replicate the success of her debut. The 1990s saw two additional releases from Tiffany, 1990's New Inside and the Asia-exclusive Dreams Never Die in 1993, both of which failed to rekindle significant interest. Tiffany returned in 2000 with her first studio album in six years, The Color of Silence. Although the album received some minor critical success, it also failed to achieve any significant standing. Since then, Tiffany has recorded five additional studio albums, as well as two albums of 1980s cover songs, and she continues to tour. Outside of music, Tiffany posed nude in Playboy and has guest-starred on several reality television shows, including Celebrity Fit Club, Australia's version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling, and has acted in a handful of horror and science fiction films, including Necrosis (2009), Mega Piranha (2010), and Mega Python vs. Gatoroid (2011)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiffany_Darwish> .

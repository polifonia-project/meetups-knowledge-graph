His music has incorporated elements of doo-wop, pop, rock, R&B, folk and blues. Initially as the lead singer of Dion and the Belmonts, and then during his solo career, Dion was one of the most popular American rock and roll performers of the pre-British Invasion era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, or with the Belmonts and the Del-Satins. He is best remembered for the singles \"Runaround Sue\", \"The Wanderer\", \"Ruby Baby\" and \"Lovers Who Wander\", among other hits. Dion's commercial popularity waned in the mid-1960s, and toward the end of the decade he shifted his style with more mature and contemplative songs, such as \"Abraham, Martin and John\". He remained popular in the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, and continued making music. During the 1980s, Dion produced , winning a GMA Dove Award in 1984 for the album I Put Away My Idols. He returned to secular music in the late 1980s with Yo Frankie (1989). Between the mid-2000s and 2021, Dion released six chart-topping blues albums.

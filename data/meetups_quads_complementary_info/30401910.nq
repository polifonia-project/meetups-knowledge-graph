<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clara_Angela_Macirone> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clara Angela Macirone (20 January 1821 â€“ 1914) was an English pianist and composer who published her music as C. A. Macirone. Born in London, she was the daughter of Italian musicians; her mother was also a pianist (a pupil of Charles Neate) and her father was an amateur tenor. She began her studies at the Royal Academy of Music in 1879 under Cipriani Potter, W H Holmes, Charles Lucas and others. She later took a position teaching at the Academy. Her first concert was given at the Hanover Square Rooms on June 26, 1846, at which the baritone Johann Pischek sung her Benedictus, a composition later praised by Mendelssohn. She was active as a performer until 1864. After that Macirone turned to teaching and composing. Her Te Deum and Jubilate were sung at Hanover Chapel and claimed to have been the first service by a woman ever used in the Church. Macirone was a pioneer in the musical education of women as both a teacher and writer. She held teaching positions at Aske's School for Girls in Hatcham (1872-8) and at the Church of England High School for Girls, Baker Street. She contributed articles to The Girl's Own Paper and The Argosy. Macirone died in London in 1914." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clara_Angela_Macirone> .

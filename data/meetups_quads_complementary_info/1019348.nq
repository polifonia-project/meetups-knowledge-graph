In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was one of the most popular Jamaican musicians in the world. Throughout his prominence in his home country as a dancehall artist, he gained popularity in North America with his studio album, Just Reality, in 1990. He released two studio albums, As Raw as Ever and X-tra Naked, which both won a Grammy Award as Best Reggae Album in 1992 and 1993, respectively. He is notoriously popular for \"Mr. Loverman\" and \"Ting-A-Ling\", which were globally acclaimed and deemed his signature songs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shabba_Ranks> .

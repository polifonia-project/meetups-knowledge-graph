<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simge_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Simge Sağın (born 8 August 1981) is a Turkish singer. From early 2010s, she started to make Turkish pop songs, and with the release of her single \"Miş Miş\" in 2015 she became one of the well-known artists in Turkey. Born in Şişli, Istanbul, Simge decided to pursue a career in music and with her father's support enrolled in Istanbul Technical University Turkish Music State Conservatory and took music education. After graduating, she worked as a backing vocalist for many pop singers before releasing her first EP Yeni Çıktı (2011) with the help of Erdem Kınay. Her debut did not earn her the success that she had intended, and her main breakthrough came four years later with the single \"Miş Miş\", which became a number-one hit on Türkçe Top 20 for four weeks. Following the release of \"Yankı\" and \"Ben Bazen\", her name continued to appear among the top three on the music charts, and her song \"Öpücem\" became a number-one hit in Turkey. Her first studio album, Ben Bazen, was released in 2018, and she received praise from music critics for her musical diversity. Simge, who has been influenced by Sezen Aksu, has generally released dance-pop songs. Since 2015 her songs have been among the most-streamed works on Turkey's radio and television programs, and in 2018 she became the second female artist with the most number of streams in the country. She has won three Golden Butterfly Awards and two Radio Boğaziçi Music Awards and has received various other nominations." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simge_(singer)> .

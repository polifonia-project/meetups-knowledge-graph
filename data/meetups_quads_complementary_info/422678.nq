<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rozz_Williams> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rozz Williams (born Roger Alan Painter; November 6, 1963 â€“ April 1, 1998) was an American singer and songwriter known for his work with the bands Christian Death, Shadow Project (with musician Eva O), and the industrial project Premature Ejaculation. Christian Death is cited by some as a pioneer of the American gothic rock scene as well as deathrock, and is considered to be one of the most influential figures of the scene. However, Williams disliked the \"goth\" label and actively worked to shed it during the 1980s and 1990s by focusing on punk rock, hard rock, cabaret, and spoken word music. Williams was also involved with his groups Daucus Karota, Heltir, EXP, Bloodflag, and his own version of Christian Death (Christian Death featuring Rozz Williams), along with recording a handful of solo albums. In addition to music, Williams was also an avid painter, poet, and collage artist. Williams committed suicide by hanging himself in his West Hollywood apartment on April 1, 1998. He was 34 years old." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rozz_Williams> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donna_Lewis> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Donna Lewis is a Welsh singer. She is best known for the 1996 pop hit single \"I Love You Always Forever\", which peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, and also peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States. In the latter country, the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, having been held off the summit by the Bayside Boys Remix of \"Macarena\" by Los Del Rio. It also became the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 by a Welsh artist since Bonnie Tyler topped the chart with \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" in 1983. Additionally, the single is tied third among songs with the longest runs at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and at second for most weeks at number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. Lewis teamed up with Richard Marx on the 1997 adult contemporary hit \"At the Beginning\" for the Anastasia soundtrack. In 1997, Lewis was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Female Artist. After releasing her second album Blue Planet, Lewis left Atlantic Records and independently released albums Be Still and In the Pink. Her album Brand New Day was produced by David Torn and featured Ethan Iverson, Reid Anderson and Dave King." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donna_Lewis> .

He is one of the lead vocalists and rhythm guitarist of English pop rock band McFly, in addition to being the group's founder. He originally auditioned for, and was accepted into the band Busted before losing out on the place after the record label decided the band should be a trio rather than a four-piece, but still carried on writing with the band. In his 20-year career as a professional songwriter, Fletcher has penned 10 UK number one singles and 21 top-ten singles. He is credited as having written songs for One Direction, Busted, the Vamps and 5 Seconds of Summer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Fletcher> .

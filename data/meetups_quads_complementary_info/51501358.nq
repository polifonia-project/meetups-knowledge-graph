He is known best under his stage name KM-MARKIT. In 1998, he was initially part of the Urbarian Gym (URBARIAN GYM / UBG), a Japanese hip-hop group, which also featured popular Japanese rapper Zeebra beginning in 1997. He went on to sign with the Pony Canyon label in 2004, releasing his first album, Vivid, in April the following year. He released one more album under label before parting ways to do his own projects. UBG later disbanded in 2010. After UBG's disbandment, in 2010, he co-founded the Raider Music Record and helped create the underground hip-hop group THE RAIDERS, becoming the executive producer.

Filipović grew up in Leskovac, Serbia, and lived there until 2003, when he moved to Belgrade. Before competing in Zvezde Granda, Filipović was singing at typical Serbian night clubs on water called \"Splavovi\". His success in the competition Zvezde Granda gave him a lot of fame and attention from people from former Yugoslavia. His most famous song is his debut single \"Ona Ona\".

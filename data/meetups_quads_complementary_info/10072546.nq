<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cy_Grant> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Cyril Ewart Lionel \"Cy\" Grant (8 November 1919 – 13 February 2010) was a Guyanese actor, musician, writer, and poet. In the 1950s, he became the first black person to be featured regularly on television in Britain, mostly due to his appearances on the BBC current affairs show Tonight. Following service in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, Grant worked as an actor and singer, before establishing the Drum Arts Centre in London in the 1970s. In the 1980s, he was appointed director of Concord Multicultural Festivals. A published poet and author of several books, including his 2007 memoir Blackness and the Dreaming Soul and other writing that reflected his belief in Taoism and an expansive world view, Grant was made an Honorary Fellow of Roehampton University in 1997, and a member of the Scientific and Medical Network in 2001. In 2008, he was the founder and inspirator of an online archive to trace and commemorate Caribbean airmen of the Second World War. A father of four children, Grant lived with his wife, Dorith (1927–2018), in Highgate, London." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cy_Grant> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Reifert> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chris Reifert (born February 23, 1968) is an American death metal musician, and one of the pioneers of the death/doom genre. Although his music is more death metal than doom metal, he is one of the first musicians that blended the two styles. He played drums on the Death debut album, Scream Bloody Gore. Since he parted ways with Chuck Schuldiner in 1987 after Schuldiner moved back to Florida, Reifert decided to stay in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in 1987 he formed his own band, Autopsy. In this band, he played not only drums but handled the vocals as well. After several albums, Autopsy split up in 1995 and Reifert and bandmate Danny Coralles began playing in their side-project, Abscess, full-time. After Abscess dissolved in 2010, Autopsy reformed and is currently planning to tour and record new material. Chris Reifert is also known for his many side-projects, including the Ravenous, , , and . He has also performed guest vocals on Machetazo's Sinfonias del Terror Ciego and the Autopsy-inspired Murder Squad's Ravenous, Murderous, with further guest appearances for , Nuclear Death, and \"Cathedral of the Damned\" on Cathedral's final album, The Last Spire. He is also known for his album cover art. His interviews are noted for his sharp wit and off-the-wall humor." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Reifert> .

He was best known, according to San Francisco Chronicle music critic Joshua Kosman, for \"the illuminating, witty and often deeply personal notes he wrote for the San Francisco Symphony's program booklets, beginning in 1979.\" He contributed several entries to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, wrote articles for music journals and magazine, notes for CDs, and published a number of books on music, both collected published annotations and new writings." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Steinberg_(music_critic)> .

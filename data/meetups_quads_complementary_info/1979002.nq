She \"was a pioneer in blending the artsiness and attitude of punk with the joyful energy of disco and pop.... [which] helped pave the way for the massive successes of her contemporaries, like Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, and anticipated the rise of confrontational but danceable alt-pop acts...\" in a mode that was at once \"campy, self-aware, and infectious.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cristina_(singer)> .

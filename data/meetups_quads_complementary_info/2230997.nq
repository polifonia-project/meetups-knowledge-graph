<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levi_Seacer_Jr.> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Levi Seacer Jr. (born April 30, 1961) is an American musician. He was an early associate of Sheila E. when he was tapped by Prince to form a new touring band after the demise of The Revolution in 1986. Seacer became the band's bassist, as well as a backing vocalist. Later, he began collaborating with Prince as a songwriter on several projects. Seacer was a founding member of Prince's The New Power Generation in 1991, switching from bass to the band's guitarist. He remained a member of the band until 1993, and also participated in the later version of Madhouse. After leaving the Prince camp in 1993, Seacer has worked as a producer and session musician on various projects, most notably the gospel music ensemble Sounds of Blackness. In 1990, he produced the majority of Right Rhythm, a Motown-issued album recorded by the pop/R&B group The Pointer Sisters. In 1991, he performed various instruments on the album Moment of Truth by Terri Nunn. In October 1998, Seacer (along with Tony M.) filed a lawsuit against Prince, claiming that Prince hadn't shared royalties that Levi and Tony were owed for songs they had co-written for Prince's , including \"Sexy MF\" and \"My Name Is Prince\". In the end, Mosely and Seacer settled for approximately $40,000 each (apparently, not even enough to pay their legal expenses), having sued Prince for $800,000." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levi_Seacer_Jr.> .

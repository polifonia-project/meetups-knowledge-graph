<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_George> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Graham Elias George (11 April 1912 â€“ 9 December 1993) was a Canadian composer, music theorist, organist, choir conductor, and music educator of English birth. An associate of the Canadian Music Centre, his compositional output consists largely of choral works, many written for Anglican liturgical use. He also wrote three ballets, four operas, and some symphonic music. In 1938 he won the Jean Lallemand Prize for his Variations on an Original Theme. At first he employed traditional tertial harmony, but the influence of Hindemith led him to introduce quartal-quintal harmony as integral to his style. Successful completion of RCCO/RCO diplomas and external degrees had demanded he attain very considerable expertise in counterpoint, and so his neoclassic deployment of contrapuntal devices such as imitation, canon and fugue is hardly accidental. His archives are part of the collection at the Library and Archives Canada." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_George> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eileen_J._Garrett> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eileen Jeanette Vancho Lyttle Garrett (17 March 1893 – 15 September 1970) was an Irish medium and parapsychologist. Garrett's alleged psychic abilities were tested in the 1930s by Joseph Rhine and others. Rhine claimed that she had genuine psychic abilities, but subsequent studies were unable to replicate his results, and Garrett's abilities were later shown to be consistent with chance guessing. Garrett elicited controversy after the R101 crash, when she held a series of séances at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research claiming to be in contact with victims of the disaster. John Booth, and others, investigated her claims, and found them to be valueless, easily explainable, or the result of fraud. Garrett was married three times, and had four children. Garrett died after a long illness on 15 September 1970, in Nice, France." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eileen_J._Garrett> .

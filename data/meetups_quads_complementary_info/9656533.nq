<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Kulenkampff> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alwin Georg Kulenkampff-Post (23 January 1898 â€“ 4 October 1948) was a German virtuoso violinist. One of the most popular German concert violinists of the 1930s and 1940s, he was considered one of the finest violinists of the 20th century. Kulenkampff was best known for his interpretations of works from the Romantic period. He gave the premiere performance of Robert Schumann's violin concerto 84 years after it was written and made the first recording of the piece. Additionally, his performances of the violin concertos of Bruch, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Glazunov are considered among the finest on record, but his early death from encephalitis and the fact that his recording career coincided with the Nazi era have prevented his name from being better known to modern listeners." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Kulenkampff> .

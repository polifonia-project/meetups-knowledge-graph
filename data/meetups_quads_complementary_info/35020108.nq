Nicky Blackmarket is one of Drum and Bass' most well known DJs and is regarded as one of the pivotal figures in the early Jungle/Drum 'n' Bass scene. He has been playing Drum 'n' Bass all over the world for the past two decades. Blackmarket started DJing in the 1980s when he was 14 and initially played electro before moving on to play all different types of dance music in house parties and on various pirate radio stations, including Pulse FM and Eruption FM, in London. He is also famous for being part-owner of independent dance music record store 'Blackmarket Records' store in Soho, Central London (now known as 'BM-Soho'). In the early 1990s, he created a department within the store for the breakbeat scene which would evolve into Drum and Bass. Blackmarket has sporadically produced tunes (\"Spam EP\" as Nick OD) however his main focus has been on playing tunes as a DJ all over the UK and the world. Blackmarket is also a fan of West London EFL team QPR." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicky_Blackmarket> .

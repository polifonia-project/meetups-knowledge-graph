<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gigi_Masin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gigi Masin (born October 24, 1955) is an Italian composer, ambient musician and producer from Venice. He is best known for his 1986 LP Wind and as a member of Gaussian Curve, a trio with Jonny Nash and Young Marco. A member of Italy's underground electronic scene, Masin pressed Wind privately and only released it at a series of small concerts in 1986. Most of the remaining copies were destroyed when Masin's house was flooded. However, it became a cult item after being sampled by artists such as Bj√∂rk and Nujabes, leading to a revival of interest in Masin's work. Music from Memory released the compilation Talk to the Sea in 2014, and the following year Masin reissued Wind on his own label The Bear on the Moon. In the years since he released two albums (Clouds, in 2015 and The Distance, in 2017) with the newly formed trio Gaussian Curve, collaborated with Italian duo Tempelhof and released three solo albums and a number of singles and collaborative works." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gigi_Masin> .

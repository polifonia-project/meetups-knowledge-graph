<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilbur_Snapp> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wilbur Snapp (August 5, 1920 â€“ September 6, 2003) was a self-taught American musician who was the stadium organist for the Clearwater Phillies, a minor-league baseball team, and for the Philadelphia Phillies in spring training, over a period of 20 years. Snapp served in the Army Air Forces in World War II; he married his wife Janice in 1942. Despite being unable to read sheet music, Snapp taught himself to play the organ at age 35; upon his retirement from operating a music store in Ohio, he moved to Florida and became a ballpark organist for the Clearwater Phillies. On June 26, 1985 he was ejected from a game at the Jack Russell Stadium for playing \"Three Blind Mice\" in response to what he thought was a bad call from the umpire, Kevin O'Connor. The umpire pointed up to Snapp, who was sitting at his organ behind first base, then thumbed him out of the game." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilbur_Snapp> .

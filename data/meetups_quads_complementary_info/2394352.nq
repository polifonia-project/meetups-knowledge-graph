As a teenager, he moved with his family to Reno, Nevada where he lived until 1988 when he relocated back to Sacramento and has been based ever since. It was while living in Reno, that he founded the highly influential hardcore punk band 7 Seconds in 1979 with his younger brother Steve Youth. Having been their frontman from the start, he also writes their lyrics. The band signed to the Better Youth Organization label in late 1983. BYO put out 7 Seconds' first album, The Crew. Since its formation, 7 Seconds has released over fifteen records as well as touring North America, Europe, and Japan multiple times. Simultaneously with his career with 7 Seconds, he has been engaged in several side band projects. These include Go National, Drop Acid, Mustard, 5'10\", Ghetto Moments, Kevin Seconds & The Altruistics, Positively Ventilate, Unsteady Heights and his newest musical project, Gimme An F. Besides his musical endeavors, Seconds is an artist and illustrator and makes his artwork available at his live shows and via his website. He also sporadically hosts an online radio show called Sound Salvation Radio as well as his own podcast The Ramble Transmissions which he oftens broadcasts live from his van while on tour. On his podcast, Seconds discusses music, art, politics, social media and whatever else happens to be on his mind at the time. Starting in 2001, Seconds and his wife Allyson owned and maintained True Love Coffeehouse in Sacramento but closed four years later after multiple problems with the landlord of the building. In 2006, Seconds reopened True Love in a new location, not far from the original location but closed it after two years, after having personal, economic, and philosophical differences with his silent business partners. The couple has no immediate plans to re-open the cafe. In the summer of 2018, the Secondses opened an art gallery, shop and live music space called Riving Loom Arts in Sacramento. Various nationally-known singer-songwriters such as Vic Ruggiero, Dave Dondero, Kepi Ghoulie, Jonah Matranga and Micah Schnabel have performed there." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Seconds> .

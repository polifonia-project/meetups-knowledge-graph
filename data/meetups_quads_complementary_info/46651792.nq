<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clive_Lewis_(politician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clive Anthony Lewis (born 11 September 1971) is a British Labour politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich South since winning the seat at the 2015 general election. Lewis was a candidate for Leader of the Labour Party in the 2020 leadership election. He is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group parliamentary caucus. He previously served as vice-president of the National Union of Students, worked as a TV reporter for BBC News and served as an infantry officer with the Territorial Army. He served a three-month tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2009. He became shadow defence secretary in June 2016, and shadow business secretary in October 2016. He left the Shadow Cabinet in 2017 in protest over the Labour Party's decision to whip its MPs into voting to trigger Article 50, but rejoined the front bench a year later as shadow minister for sustainable economics. He stood in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, but did not receive the required 22 parliamentarian nominations, and withdrew." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clive_Lewis_(politician)> .

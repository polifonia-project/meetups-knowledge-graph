<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Kilbey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Steven John Kilbey (born 13 September 1954) is an English-Australian singer-songwriter and bass guitarist for the rock band The Church. He is also a music producer, poet, and painter. As of 2020, Kilbey has released 14 solo albums and has collaborated on recordings with musical artists such as Martin Kennedy, Stephen Cummings and Ricky Maymi as a vocalist, musician, writer and/or producer. Ian McFarlane writes that \"Kilbey's solo recordings [are] challenging and evocative. They ran the gamut of sounds and emotions from electronic and avant-garde to acoustic and symphonic, joyous and dreamy to saturnine and sardonic\". As of 2020, Kilbey has over 1000 original songs registered with Australian copyright agency Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Kilbey> .

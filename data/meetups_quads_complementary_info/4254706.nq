He studied for five years in India with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. Bhatt is the inventor of the 20-stringed mohan veena, which has become Manx's signature instrument.He has released twelve albums in twelve years, and has his own record label Dog My Cats Records.He has received much recognition and many awards, including: seven Maple Blues Awards, six Juno nominations, the Canadian Folk Music Award in 2005 for Best Solo Artist, and CBC Radioâ€™s \"Great Canadian Blues Award\" in 2007.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Norman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jimmy Norman (August 12, 1937 â€“ November 8, 2011) was an American rhythm and blues and jazz musician and a songwriter. In his early career, Norman had a charting single of his own, \"I Don't Love You No More (I Don't Care About You)\", as well as performing session work with Jimi Hendrix, but he is better known as a lyricist and songwriter. He wrote the expanded lyrics of the song \"Time Is on My Side\", which became a hit for The Rolling Stones and was later re-recorded and produced by Stephen Vanderbilt featuring \"St. Tropez\" as the A side of a 45 released from the album Home throughout Europe. Norman composed a number of songs performed by well-known musicians including Johnny Nash and Bob Marley. In 1969 he became involved with doo-wop band The Coasters, first as a producer and then as a touring member. He was also recording independently, releasing a solo album in 1998, the same year poor health forced him to retire from performance. Like many other musicians of his time, he was not financially prepared for retirement or heavy medical bills, and with few royalties for his writing soon found himself in economic crisis. With the assistance of charitable organization Jazz Foundation of America, Norman regained his feet and resumed performing, releasing his first wide-distribution album in 2004, Little Pieces. He performed in the Manhattan area until shortly before his death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Norman> .

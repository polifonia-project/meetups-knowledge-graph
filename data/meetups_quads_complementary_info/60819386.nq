<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lingua_Ignota_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kristin Hayter (born June 17, 1986), known professionally as Lingua Ignota (Latin for \"unknown language\"), is an American classically trained multi-instrumentalist. In 2017, she self-released the albums Let the Evil of His Own Lips Cover Him and All Bitches Die under the Lingua Ignota moniker, which spread through word-of-mouth. Lingua Ignota's music caught the attention of Profound Lore Records, who re-issued All Bitches Die and released her third studio album, Caligula, in 2019. She draws on her experiences as a survivor of domestic violence for musical and lyrical inspiration, and describes her music as \"survivor anthems\". Hayter is originally from Southern California and resided in Pennsylvania for a time before moving to Chicago." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lingua_Ignota_(musician)> .

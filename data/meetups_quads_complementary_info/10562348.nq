<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_Bell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pedro Bell (June 11, 1950 – August 27, 2019) was an American artist and illustrator, best known for his elaborate album cover designs and other artwork for numerous Funkadelic and George Clinton solo albums. Bell also wrote many of the liner notes of the records under the name Sir Lleb (his surname spelled backwards). The liner notes contributed to P-Funk's literary mythology — a sampling of his contributions include \"Thumpasaurus,\" \"Funkapus,\" \"Queen Freakalene,\" \"Bop Gun,\" and \"Zone of Zero Funkativity.\" Bell's work was preceded and partially inspired by Sun Ra and was a precursor to the modern graphic novel and the Afro-punk movement." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedro_Bell> .

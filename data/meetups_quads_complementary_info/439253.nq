<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Hall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Scott Oliver Hall (October 20, 1958 â€“ March 14, 2022) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his tenures with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name and under the ring name the Diamond Studd and with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) under the ring name Razor Ramon. Born in St. Mary's County, Maryland, Hall began his career in 1984. He rose to prominence after signing with the WWF in May 1992, assuming the name Razor Ramon. While within the company, he won the WWF Intercontinental Championship four times. He departed the company in May 1996, and subsequently signed with rival promotion WCW, where he became a founding member of the New World Order (nWo) faction, along with Hulk Hogan and Kevin Nash. In the company, he became a two-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WCW World Television Champion, and a seven-time WCW World Tag Team Champion. He left WCW in February 2000, returning to the WWF (later renamed WWE) for a brief stint in 2002. He spent the rest of his career wrestling for various promotions, such as Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he held the TNA World Tag Team Championship once, with Kevin Nash and Eric Young. He wrestled his final match in June 2016. After years of alcohol abuse, Hall died at the age of 63 on March 4, 2022. Hall is considered one of the most charismatic performers in the modern history of professional wrestling. Although he never won a world championship in a major promotion, Hall held the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a singles competitor in 2014, and as a member of the nWo in 2020." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Hall> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wayne_Kramer_(guitarist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wayne Kramer (born Wayne Kambes; April 30, 1948) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, producer and film and television composer. Kramer came to prominence as a teenager in 1967 as a co-founder of the Detroit rock group MC5, a group known for their powerful live performances and radical left-wing political stand. The MC5 broke up amid government harassment, poverty and drug abuse. For Kramer, this led to several fallow years as he battled drug addiction before returning to an active recording and performing schedule in the 1990s. Rolling Stone ranked him among the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wayne_Kramer_(guitarist)> .

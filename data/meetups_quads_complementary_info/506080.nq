<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Paul_Gaultier> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jean Paul Gaultier (French: [ʒɑ̃ pɔl ɡotje]; born 24 April 1952) is a French haute couture and prêt-à-porter fashion designer. He is described as an \"enfant terrible\" of the fashion industry and is known for his unconventional designs with motifs including corsets, marinières, and tin cans. Gaultier founded his self-titled fashion label in 1982, and expanded with a line of fragrances in 1993. He was the creative director for French luxury house Hermès from 2003 to 2010, and retired following his 50th-anniversary haute couture show during Paris Fashion Week in January 2020. Aside from his work in the fashion industry, Gaultier co-presented the first seven series of the television series Eurotrash with Antoine de Caunes from 1993–1997." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Paul_Gaultier> .

She launched her career in 1993 as a part of the duo Funky G, together with her former husband Gagi Đogani with whom she has a daughter Luna Djogani. The duo split in 2009 because Gagi Đogani was abusive in their marriage. Anabela continued her career as a solo singer, and released her first solo album, Igra sudbine, on 21 July 2010 through City Records." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anabela_(singer)> .

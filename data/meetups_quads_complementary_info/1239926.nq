He is the founder and lead singer of the band Aquarium which has been active from 1972 until today. Grebenshchikov is frequently referred to as BG (Russian: БГ; pronounced \"Beh-Geh\"), after his initials. On 5 October 2022, he appeared on BBC Hardtalk talking about his opposition to the Russian intervention in Ukraine, his self-imposed exile to London, and his involvement with Dave Stewart to produce an antiwar record to support the people of Ukraine." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boris_Grebenshchikov> .

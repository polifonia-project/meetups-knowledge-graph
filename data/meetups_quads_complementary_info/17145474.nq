He is the key member and producer of heavy metal band Rebellion since 2000 and is currently one of three guitarists of German band Accept. He also played guitar in Grave Digger for about 13 years, and co-wrote many songs during his time in the band. Lulis is a known producer and owns his studio Black Solaris Studios. He has produced other bands like Wizard, Paragon, Montany etc. When Lulis left Grave Digger, he formed his band Rebellion together with ex-bassist of Grave Digger, Tomi GÃ¶ttlich. Alongside two other members, Lulis left Rebellion in 2010. In October 2008, Lulis broke his right leg in a motorcycle crash. Because of this, his band Rebellion used only one guitarist on their planned gigs. On 4 December 2014, Lulis joined Accept as a replacement for guitarist Herman Frank." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uwe_Lulis> .

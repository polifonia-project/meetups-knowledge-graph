He began racing in 1980, and posted 23 top-ten finishes over his career. NASCAR's website says that he is probably best known for his \"close, side-by-side second to Bill Elliott in Daytona's summer event in 1988.\" He was also known for taking over Richard Petty's car at Petty Enterprises after Petty retired in a car numbered 44." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rick_Wilson_(racing_driver)> .

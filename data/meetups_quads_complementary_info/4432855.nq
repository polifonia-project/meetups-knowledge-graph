Sharp came on the country music scene in 1996 with his first single: a cover of Tony Rich's \"Nobody Knows\", which topped the Billboard country chart for four weeks. The same year, Sharp released his first album, Measure of a Man. Having survived a form of bone cancer in his teenage years, Sharp became actively involved in the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He wrote an inspirational book about his life and his fight with cancer, and occasionally toured the United States as a motivational speaker. Sharp died from complications of stomach surgery in April 2014." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Sharp> .

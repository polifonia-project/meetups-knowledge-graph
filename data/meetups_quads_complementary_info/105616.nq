<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Dodds> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Johnny Dodds (/ˈdɒts/; April 12, 1892 – August 8, 1940) was an American jazz clarinetist and alto saxophonist based in New Orleans, best known for his recordings under his own name and with bands such as those of Joe \"King\" Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Lovie Austin and Louis Armstrong. Dodds was the older brother of the drummer Warren \"Baby\" Dodds, one of the first important jazz drummers. They worked together in the New Orleans Bootblacks in 1926. Dodds is an important figure in jazz history. He was the premier clarinetist of his era and, in recognition of his artistic contributions, he was posthumously inducted into the Jazz Hall of Fame. He has been described as \"a prime architect in the creation of the Jazz Age.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Dodds> .

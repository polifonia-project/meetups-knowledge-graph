<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canelo_Álvarez> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Santos Saúl \"Canelo\" Álvarez Barragán (American Spanish: [saˈul ˈalβaɾes]; born 18 July 1990) is a Mexican professional boxer. He has won multiple world championships in four weight classes from light middleweight to light heavyweight, including unified titles in three of those weight classes and lineal titles in two. Álvarez is the first and only boxer in history to become undisputed champion at super middleweight, having held the WBA (Super), WBC and Ring magazine titles since 2020, and the IBF and WBO titles since 2021. Álvarez is known as an excellent counterpuncher, being able to exploit openings in his opponents' guards while avoiding punches with head and body movement. He is also known as a formidable body puncher. As of May 2022, Álvarez is ranked as the world's best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec and the Boxing Writers Association of America; fourth by ESPN; fifth by the TBRB; and sixth by The Ring. He is also ranked as the world's best active super middleweight by BoxRec, The Ring, TBRB, and ESPN." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canelo_Álvarez> .

McCarthy (born June 20, 1949) is an American former policeman and special agent in the United States Secret Service. McCarthy is best known for defending President Ronald Reagan during the assassination attempt on Reagan's life on Monday, March 30, 1981, in Washington, D.C. During the assassination attempt, McCarthy spread his stance to protect Reagan as six bullets were being fired by the would-be assassin, John Hinckley Jr. McCarthy stepped in front of President Reagan, and took a bullet to the chest but made a full recovery. After the assassination attempt, McCarthy was hailed as a hero and received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_McCarthy> .

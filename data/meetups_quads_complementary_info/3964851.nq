<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hiromi_Go> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hiromi Go (郷 ひろみ, Gō Hiromi, born October 18, 1955, in Sue, Kasuya, Fukuoka Prefecture), is a Japanese singer, part of Sony Music Entertainment Japan. His real name is Hiromi Haratake (原武 裕美, Haratake Hiromi). In the 1970s, he was called the \"New Big Three\" (新御三家, shin gosanke) with Goro Noguchi and Hideki Saijo. He belonged to Johnny & Associates, but later left the agency. He also effectively became the Japanese answer to Ricky Martin after his 1999 Japanese version of \"Livin' la Vida Loca,\" which was called \"Goldfinger '99\". His stage name's initials are \"HG\", and that, combined with his remake of Ricky Martin's \"Livin la Vida Loca\" made him a direct target of comedian Hard Gay. Go featured Japanese hip hop musician Dohzi-T in his R&B-style song \"Kimi Dake o,\" released on May 14, 2008. \"Kimi Dake o\" was included in his album Place to Be, and the remix of the song was included as a bonus track in Dohzi-T's album 12 Love Stories. Go appeared in the Canadian film Samurai Cowboy with Catherine Mary Stewart and Robert Conrad, which was released in 1993. He was also invited to the Japanese touring ice show Fantasy on Ice in 2014, where he performed live with figure skater and two-time Olympic champion, Yuzuru Hanyu, to the song \"Ienai yo\" (lit. \"I can't say it\") amongst others." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hiromi_Go> .

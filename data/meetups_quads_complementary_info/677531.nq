<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_M._Gavin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Maurice Gavin (March 22, 1907 â€“ February 23, 1990), sometimes called \"Jumpin' Jim\" and \"the jumping general\", was a senior United States Army officer, with the rank of lieutenant general, who was the third Commanding General (CG) of the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II. During the war, he was often referred to as \"The Jumping General\" because of his practice of taking part in combat jumps with the paratroopers under his command; he was the only American general officer to make four combat jumps in the war. Gavin was the youngest major general to command an American division in World War II, being only 37 upon promotion, and the youngest lieutenant general after the war, in March 1955. He was awarded two Distinguished Service Crosses and several other decorations for his service in the war. During combat, he was known for his habit of carrying an M1 rifle, typically carried by enlisted U.S. infantry soldiers, instead of the M1 carbine, which officers customarily carried. Gavin also worked against segregation in the U.S. Army, which gained him some notability. After the war, Gavin served as United States Ambassador to France from 1961 to 1962." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_M._Gavin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Hartley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jean Hartley (née Holland; 27 April 1933 – 18 July 2011) was an English autobiographer and publisher. She and her husband George Hartley co-founded the publication company Marvell Press in 1954, which published volumes of poetry. They also founded the record company Listen Records. After Hartley separated from her husband and left Marvell Press, she earned degrees in English Literature and Victorian Studies from the University of Hull in the early 1970s. She taught English at her former secondary school and lectured at the Hull College of Further Education. In 1995, Hartley was made vice-chairman of the Philip Larkin Society to promote the life and works of her friend and poet Philip Larkin. She was on the steering committee of the Larkin 25 committee in 2010. The Hull History Centre holds a collection of items on Hartley's life and career." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Hartley> .

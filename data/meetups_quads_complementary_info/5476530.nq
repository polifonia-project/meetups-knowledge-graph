<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Paxton> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Charles Paxton (November 27, 1820 â€“ July 3, 1887) was a Canadian politician, businessman and sheriff. As a partner in industrial business ventures, he was one of the founding fathers of Port Perry. He helped establish the first steam-powered sawmill on Lake Scugog in 1846, then later operated a flour mill and was a partner in a foundry which manufactured machinery for agriculture and mills. He turned to politics in 1854, served as the second reeve of Reach and Scugog Townships, and he was the first person to represent the Ontario North electoral district in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. He won four elections to the provincial parliament, where he served in office from 1867 to 1881, and took interest in legislation for railways and the timber industry. He partnered with other local businessmen in 1867 to construct the Port Whitby and Port Perry Railway which was completed in 1872. He resigned from the legislature in 1881 to serve as sheriff of Ontario County until 1887." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Paxton> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolas_Asimos> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nikolas Asimos (Greek: Νικόλας Άσιμος; 20 August 1949 – 17 March 1988) was a Greek composer, singer and performance artist. His real surname was Asimopoulos (Ασημόπουλος). Asimos was a very special case of a counter-culture artist, mostly because of his lifestyle. His behaviour and songs were often received as provocative by the general public. He was a person with strong political opinions. Ideologically, he could be categorised as an anarchist but he never accepted being put in a specific political ideology." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolas_Asimos> .

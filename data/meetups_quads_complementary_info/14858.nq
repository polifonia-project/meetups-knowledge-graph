<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iain_Banks> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Iain Banks (16 February 1954 – 9 June 2013) was a Scottish author, writing mainstream fiction as Iain Banks and science fiction as Iain M. Banks, adding the initial of his adopted middle name Menzies (/ˈmɪŋɪz/). After the success of The Wasp Factory (1984), he began to write full time. His first science fiction book, Consider Phlebas, appeared in 1987, marking the start of the Culture series. His books have been adapted for theatre, radio and television. In 2008, The Times named Banks in their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". In April 2013, Banks announced he had inoperable cancer and was unlikely to live beyond a year. He died on 9 June 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iain_Banks> .

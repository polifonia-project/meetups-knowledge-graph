<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_L._Harris> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen L. Harris (February 5, 1937 - April 14, 2019) was Professor of Humanities and Religious Studies at California State University, Sacramento. He served there ten years as department chair and was named a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. He received his MA and PhD degrees from Cornell University. Harris was a member of the American Academy of Religion, a fellow at the Westar Institute, a fellow of the controversial Jesus Seminar, and authored several books on religion, some of which are used in introductory university courses. He also had a strong interest in some geological topics. Harris grew up in western Washington state where the views of Mount Rainier and the mentoring of his grandfather inspired a lifelong interest in the eruptive potential of the volcanoes in the Cascade Mountain range, about which he became a widely known authority. Harris taught an adult education class on \"Evolving Concepts of God\" at St. Mark's Methodist Church, Sacramento, using his text, The Old Testament: An Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. He died of cancer in Sacramento at the age of 82." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_L._Harris> .

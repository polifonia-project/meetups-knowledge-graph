<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Izora_Armstead> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Izora Rhodes-Armstead (July 6, 1942 â€“ September 16, 2004) was an American singer-songwriter. Known for her distinctive alto voice, Armstead first achieved fame as one half of the successful act Two Tons O' Fun who sang backup vocals for American disco singer Sylvester. After gaining their own record deal, they released three consecutive commercially successful songs which all peaked at number 2 in the dance charts. The duo was renamed The Weather Girls in 1982 after they released the top-selling single \"It's Raining Men\", which brought the duo to mainstream pop attention. As a duo, The Weather Girls released five albums and were heavily featured on Sylvester's albums. After The Weather Girls disbanded in 1988, Armstead released a single, \"Don't Let Love Slip Away\" (1991). In 1991, she reformed The Weather Girls with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes, who had been one of the duo's background singers. Over the course of a decade, they released three albums: Double Tons of Fun (1993), Think Big! (1995), and Puttin' On The Hits (1999). On September 16, 2004, Armstead died from heart failure in San Leandro, California." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Izora_Armstead> .

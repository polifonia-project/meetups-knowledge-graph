<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Brouwer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Matt Brouwer (born February 28, 1976) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. While in college, he and fellow students founded the band Monday Night Worship (MNW). Because of the spiritual content of his lyrics he was 'discovered' by a Nashville record company in 2000, and in 2001 recorded his solo debut CD Imagerical. The album was released on May 29, 2001, on Reunion Records. He then formed his own label called Black Shoe Records and released albums titled Unlearning in 2005, Where's Our Revolution (Universal) in 2009, and Till The Sunrise in 2012. Brouwer's music is known for its Contemporary Christian message as he shares his life's story of tragedy (the death of his father) and hope (his spiritual pilgrimage) with his listeners." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Brouwer> .

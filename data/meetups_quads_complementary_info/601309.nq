<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicky_Wire> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nicholas Allen Jones (born 20 January 1969), known as Nicky Wire, is a Welsh musician and songwriter, best known as lyricist, bassist and secondary vocalist of the Welsh alternative rock band, Manic Street Preachers. Prior to the group, Wire studied politics at university; this would later influence his lyrical work. He was co-writer of the band's lyrics (alongside Richey Edwards) from 1989 to 1995, and has been the band's primary lyricist since 1995, following Edwards' disappearance. In addition to his work with Manic Street Preachers, Wire released a solo album, I Killed the Zeitgeist, in 2006." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicky_Wire> .

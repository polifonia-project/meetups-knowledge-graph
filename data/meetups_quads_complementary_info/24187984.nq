<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jared_Gutstadt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jared Gutstadt (born September 19, 1977), also known as Jingle Jared, is a Canadian-born entrepreneur, inventor, and musician best known for founding the creative music agency Jingle Punks (2008), and the scripted-podcast network Audio Up (2020). Through Jingle Punks, Gustadt acquired and created a catalog of 500,000 songs and a roster of over 1,000 television shows. His collaborators include Bob Dylan, Steven Tyler, Timbaland, Nas, Lil Wayne, Brad Paisley, Miranda Lambert, Machine Gun Kelly, and others. In 2019, he served as Chief-Collaborator-in Residence for NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, his alma mater. In 2020, Gutstadt received two Adweek awards for Podcast Innovator and Producer of the Year. His latest venture, Audio Up, specializes in scripted podcasts that feature original music from known and emerging artists. A student of media history, Gutstadt believes that podcasts will serve as “the next great discovery platform.” “I do believe that musicals of the future will evolve from the world of podcasts,” Gutstadt told Rolling Stone. “The future of entertainment” involves “musical stories built from the ground up.” Audio Up's present and future collaborators include Dennis Quaid, Anthony Anderson, Scarlett Burke, Michael Cohen, James Ellroy, and Stephen King." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jared_Gutstadt> .

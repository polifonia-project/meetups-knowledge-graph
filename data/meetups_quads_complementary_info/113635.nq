<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wong_Fei-hung> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wong Fei-hung (born Wong Sek-cheung with the courtesy name Tat-wun; 9 July 1847 – 17 April 1925) was a Chinese martial artist, physician, and folk hero. His recent fame was due to becoming the subject of numerous martial arts films and television series. Even though he was considered an expert in the Hung Ga style of Chinese martial arts, his real public fame was as a physician, who practiced and taught acupuncture, Dit Da and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine in the now famous Po Chi Lam (寶芝林; 宝芝林; Bǎozhīlín; Bou2-zi1-lam4), a medical clinic in Canton (Guangzhou), Kwangtung Province (Guangdong). A museum dedicated to him was built in his birthplace in Fatshan (Foshan), Kwangtung." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wong_Fei-hung> .

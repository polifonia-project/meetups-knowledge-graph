Born and raised in Thái Bình City, Thái Bình Province, his family discovered his singing ability when he was two years old. His self-written 2012 and 2013 singles, \"Cơn mưa ngang qua\" and \"Em của ngày hôm qua\" launched his career. These were followed by successful singles such as \"Chắc ai đó sẽ về\", \"Lạc trôi\" and \"Nơi này có anh\". In 2017, Tùng released the compilation album m-tp M-TP and published his autobiography, Chạm tới giấc mơ. Tùng spent four years as part of Văn Production and WePro Entertainment until his record label, M-TP Entertainment, was founded in late 2016. His other works include the M-TP Ambition - Chuyến bay đầu tiên tour (2015–2016), the Sky Tour (2019), a starring role in the 2014 film Dandelion (which earned him a Golden Kite Prize for Young Prominent Actor) and an appearance as a contestant on the television series The Remix. Called a \"King of V-pop\" for his popularity, Tùng has received many accolades which include a MTV Europe Music Award, a Dedication Music Award, a Mnet Asian Music Award, seven Green Wave Awards and an inclusion on Forbes Vietnam's 2018 30 Under 30 list." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sơn_Tùng_M-TP> .

After starting her career as a duo with her then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham, releasing the album Buckingham Nicks to little success, Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, helping the band to become one of the best-selling music acts of all time with over 120 million records sold worldwide. Rumours, the band's second album with Nicks, became one of the best-selling albums worldwide, being certified 20Ã— platinum in the US. In 1981, while remaining a member of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began her solo career, releasing the studio album Bella Donna, which topped the Billboard 200 and has reached multiplatinum status. She has released eight studio solo albums and seven studio albums with Fleetwood Mac, selling a certified total of 65 million copies in the US alone. After the release of her first solo album, Rolling Stone named her the \"Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll\". Nicks was named one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time and one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone. Her Fleetwood Mac songs \"Landslide\", \"Rhiannon\", and \"Dreams\", with the latter being the band's only number one hit in the US, together with her solo hit \"Edge of Seventeen\", have all been included in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. She is the first woman to have been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and then as a solo artist in 2019. Nicks has garnered eight Grammy Award nominations and two American Music Award nominations as a solo artist. She has won numerous awards with Fleetwood Mac, including a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978 for Rumours. The albums Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, and Bella Donna have been included in the \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums\" chart by Billboard. Furthermore, Rumours was rated the seventh-greatest album of all time in Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", as well as the fourth-greatest album by female acts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Nicks> .

He became Montana's senior senator in 2014 following Max Baucus's departure and is the dean of Montana's congressional delegation. Since January 4, 2021, he has been the only member of the Democratic Party to hold statewide office in Montana. Tester was first elected in 2006, defeating Republican incumbent Conrad Burns in one of the closest Senate races of that year. He narrowly won reelection in 2012 against U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg, and in 2018 against Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale. Tester was previously the president of the Montana Senate and worked as a music teacher and farmer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Tester> .

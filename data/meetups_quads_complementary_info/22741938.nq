Grimm's first release was the 1993 single \"Indo Smoke\" featuring Warren G and Nate Dogg from the Poetic Justice soundtrack. The following year Grimm released a single entitled \"Situation: Grimm\" that appeared on the Higher Learning soundtrack. Mista Grimm completed his debut album Things are Looking Grimm that was originally set to be released during the summer of 1995; however, after the album's lead single \"Steady Dippen\" failed to make an impact, the album was shelved. Little has been heard of Mista Grimm subsequently aside from a song called \"Grow Room\" on DJ Pooh's 1997 album Bad Newz Travels Fast, appearances on T-Bone's albums Tha Hoodlum's Testimony (1995) and GospelAlphaMegaFunkyBoogieDiscoMusic (2002), and an appearance on Warren G's 2001 album The Return of the Regulator." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mista_Grimm> .

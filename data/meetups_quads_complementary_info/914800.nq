<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rambo_Amadeus> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Antonije Pušić (Cyrillic: Антоније Пушић; born 14 June 1963), known professionally as Rambo Amadeus (Cyrillic: Рамбо Амадеус) is a Montenegrin singer. A self-titled \"musician, poet, and media manipulator\", he is a noted artist across the countries of former Yugoslavia. His songs combine satirical lyrics on human nature and the silliness of local politics with a mixture of musical styles including jazz, rock, hip-hop and lately drum and bass, and self-conscious ironic wit; for example, his most popular alias is \"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Kilo Car\" (\"Rambo Amadeus the World Kilo Tzar\"), formerly \"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Mega Car\" (\"Rambo Amadeus the World Mega Tzar\") (RASMC) (changed in 2012 because of his belief in the importance of modesty in an environmentally conscious society). His stage name itself is made from John Rambo and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. His concerts are never mere repetitions of recorded songs, but a mixture of free improvisation and satirical humor exploiting all aspects of human nature in a crude manner. Some fans compare his style with Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. Rambo Amadeus represented Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the song \"Euro Neuro\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rambo_Amadeus> .

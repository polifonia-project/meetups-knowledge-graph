<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dr._John> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Malcolm John Rebennack Jr. (November 20, 1941 â€“ June 6, 2019), better known by his stage name Dr. John, was an American singer and songwriter. His music encompassed New Orleans blues, jazz, funk, and R&B. Active as a session musician from the late 1950s until his death, he gained a following in the late 1960s after the release of his album Gris-Gris (1968) and his appearance at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. He typically performed a lively, theatrical stage show inspired by medicine shows, Mardi Gras costumes, and voodoo ceremonies. Rebennack recorded thirty studio albums and nine live albums, as well as contributing to thousands of other musicians' recordings. In 1973, he achieved a top 10 hit single with \"Right Place, Wrong Time\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dr._John> .

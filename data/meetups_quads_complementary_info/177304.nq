<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heitor_Villa-Lobos> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Heitor Villa-Lobos (March 5, 1887 – November 17, 1959) was a Brazilian composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist described as \"the single most significant creative figure in 20th-century Brazilian art music\". Villa-Lobos has become the best-known South American composer of all time. A prolific composer, he wrote numerous orchestral, chamber, instrumental and vocal works, totaling over 2000 works by his death in 1959. His music was influenced by both Brazilian folk music and stylistic elements from the European classical tradition, as exemplified by his Bachianas Brasileiras (Brazilian Bachian-pieces) and his Chôros. His Etudes for classical guitar (1929) were dedicated to Andrés Segovia, while his 5 Preludes (1940) were dedicated to his spouse Arminda Neves d'Almeida, a.k.a. \"Mindinha\". Both are important works in the classical guitar repertory." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heitor_Villa-Lobos> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Jarman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gary John Jarman is a British multi-instrumentalist, best known for being bassist and singer in the Wakefield music group The Cribs. Formed in 2002, The Cribs have released eight albums to date, and numerous singles and EPs. As of 2016 their latest three records have charted in the UK top 10, alongside 7 top 40 singles. He has lived in Portland, Oregon, since 2006. The band consists of his twin brother Ryan and his younger brother Ross. Gary is the most political member of The Cribs, and can regularly be heard in interviews criticizing inequality and misogyny in the music industry. This could be attributed to the fact that he spent a few years prior to the band's success, participating as part of the committee that put on the UK's first \"Ladyfest\" in London, and also numerous fundraisers around this time. In 2009 he underwent surgery in the US to remove growths from his vocal cords." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Jarman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigi_Ziering> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sigi Ziering (March 20, 1928 â€“ November 12, 2000) was a German-born American business executive, scientist, playwright and philanthropist. A Holocaust survivor, he immigrated to the United States with his family, earned a doctorate in theoretical physics in 1958, and worked for a time as an industrial physicist. In 1973 he became president of the Diagnostic Products Corporation, a tiny startup company that was developing advanced tests used for medical diagnosis. By the time of Ziering's death, the company had 1700 employees and marketed more than 400 immunodiagnostic tests. In 2006, the company was acquired by Siemens for 1.86 billion dollars (US) and became a subsidiary, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics. In later life, Ziering was an active philanthropist in Los Angeles, California." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigi_Ziering> .

She released her first single, \"Anata no kisu o kazoemashô – You Were Mine\" on September 15, 1999. This song was a huge hit in Japan and made the 17-year-old a sensation overnight. Her second album, Expansion, sold over 1.3 million copies, and it features her most biggest chart hit, \"Aijo\". She has done several albums (in English) of cover songs, including disco and movie standards. After a break of several years, her album Sunrise was released in March 2007. Koyanagi was born in Saitama City, Japan to a Trinbagonian-American father and a Japanese mother. She is known for singing the English version of \"Cross Colors\", the ending theme of Dynasty Warriors 4. Before that, she worked with Nathan Morris and Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men who wrote most of the songs on and produced her album Intimacy. She performed the songs in English, without understanding what she was singing. Yuki sang the American and Japanese National Anthems during the 2006 World Baseball Classic in Tokyo. She also sang the Japanese National Anthem for an international soccer match between Japan and Trinidad & Tobago in 2006." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuki_Koyanagi> .

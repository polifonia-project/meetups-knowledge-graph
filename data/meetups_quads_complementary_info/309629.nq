He has also recorded or performed with Sparklehorse, Rhys Chatham, Shivaree, Pigface, Flour, and others. Sims currently performs experimental solo electric bass as Unfact. Sims was born and raised in Austin, Texas. His parents were an American-history professor and a nurse. Besides being a musician, Sims is a Certified Public Accountant and blogged on his personal website from 2008 to 2011, with only updates subsequently. In a Kreative Kontrol podcast in 2014, it was discussed that Sims \"always had issues with the name\" of Rapeman and that it was \"the biggest musical regret\" of his life. He lives in New York City." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Wm._Sims> .

While studying at the Mannes College of Music in New York City in the early 1990s, Qin founded the Rough Assemblage composers' collective, along with Mark De Gli Antoni and Norman Yamada. Born and raised in New York City, Qin was killed in a bicycle accident on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on April 19, 1993, at the age of 25. His music was performed posthumously at the 1993 Bang on a Can Festival, and a CD of his music entitled Photographs was released in 2002." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Qin> .

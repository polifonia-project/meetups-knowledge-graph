<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Werner_Reinhart> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Werner Reinhart (19 March 1884 – 29 August 1951) was a Swiss merchant, philanthropist, amateur clarinetist, and patron of composers and writers, particularly Igor Stravinsky and Rainer Maria Rilke. Reinhart knew and corresponded with many artists and musicians of the early-mid 20th century in Europe world, and his Villa Rychenberg in Winterthur became an international meeting point for musicians and writers. He was sometimes referred to as \"the Winterthur Maecenas\". Alice Bailly named Werner Reinhart \"L'homme aux mains d'or\" – the man with the golden hands, and her 1920 portrait of him is called \"The Man with the Golden Heart\".Oskar Kokoschka also painted his portrait in 1947. Werner Reinhart inherited his wealth from the Volkart family business, based in Winterthur, which he ran together with his elder brother Georg. Reinhart and Hermann Scherchen played a leading role in shaping the musical life of Winterthur between 1922 and 1950, the emphasis being on contemporary music, and they were instrumental in numerous premieres being performed there. Scherchen was one of many people whom Reinhart patronised, not least in Scherchen's case because he had to pay alimony to no less than five ex-wives." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Werner_Reinhart> .

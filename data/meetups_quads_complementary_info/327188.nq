<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Shannon_Jackson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ronald Shannon Jackson (January 12, 1940 – October 19, 2013) was an American jazz drummer from Fort Worth, Texas. A pioneer of avant-garde jazz, free funk, and jazz fusion, he appeared on over 50 albums as a bandleader, sideman, arranger, and producer. Jackson and bassist Sirone are the only musicians to have performed and recorded with the three prime shapers of free jazz: pianist Cecil Taylor, and saxophonists Ornette Coleman and Albert Ayler. Musician, Player and Listener magazine writers David Breskin and Rafi Zabor called him \"the most stately free-jazz drummer in the history of the idiom, a regal and thundering presence.\" Gary Giddins wrote \"Jackson is an astounding drummer, as everyone agrees…he has emerged as a kind of all-purpose new-music connoisseur who brings a profound and unshakably individual approach to every playing situation.\" In 1979, he founded his own group, the Decoding Society, playing what has been dubbed free funk: a blend of funk rhythm and free jazz improvisation." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Shannon_Jackson> .

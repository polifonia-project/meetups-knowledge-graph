<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sue_Draheim> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sue Draheim (/ˈdrɔːhaɪm/ DRAW-hyme; August 17, 1949 – April 11, 2013) was an American fiddler, boasting a more than forty year musical career in the US and the UK. Growing up in North Oakland, Draheim began her first private violin lessons at age eleven, having started public school violin instruction at age eight while attending North Oakland's Peralta Elementary School. She also attended Claremont Jr. High, and graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1967. Originally trained as a classical violinist, Draheim became involved in many other genres and recorded albums with groups representing Cajun, Old Time, country, Zydeco, folk jazz, Irish and British folk music. Early on in her career, Celtic fiddle became Draheim's major focus. While Draheim was primarily a fiddler, she never lost touch with her classical training, and was a member of the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra and the Bay Area Women's Philharmonic as well as UC Berkeley's University Chamber Chorus; Draheim, along with fiddler Kerry Parker, also \"augmented\" the harp trio \"Trillium\". She also played in the US premiere of Frank Zappa's experimental orchestral piece A Zappa Affair. She was described by , cellist/composer with whom she performed one of Alcock's pieces, as \"fiddler extraordinaire\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sue_Draheim> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cole_Weston> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Cole Weston (January 30, 1919 â€“ April 20, 2003) was photographer Edward Weston's fourth and youngest son. Although Weston \"was born into the tradition of craftsman- produced black-and-white art photography, he was to find his own photographic direction in colour.\". Cole Weston's life followed a diverse course that started with theater, later leading him to the Navy, a position photographing for Life, and later photographing portraits, before he moved to Carmel, California in 1946, at his father's request. In the years that followed, Cole became his father's assistant and trusted companion; and, as Edward's struggle with Parkinson's disease worsened, Cole became the keeper of two careers, his father's and his own. Before his death in 2003, Cole Weston was devoted to keeping both bodies of work flourishing and circulating widely." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cole_Weston> .

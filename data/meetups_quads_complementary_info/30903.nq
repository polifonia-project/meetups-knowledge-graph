<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Pynchon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Ruggles Pynchon Jr. (/ˈpɪntʃˌɒn/ PINCH-awn, commonly /ˈpɪntʃˌən/ PINCH-in; born May 8, 1937) is an American novelist noted for his dense and complex novels. His fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter, genres and themes, including history, music, science, and mathematics. For Gravity's Rainbow, Pynchon won the 1973 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. Hailing from Long Island, Pynchon served two years in the United States Navy and earned an English degree from Cornell University. After publishing several short stories in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he began composing the novels for which he is best known: V. (1963), The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), and Gravity's Rainbow (1973). His 2009 novel Inherent Vice was adapted into a feature film of the same name by director Paul Thomas Anderson in 2014. Pynchon is notoriously reclusive from the media; few photographs of him have been published, and rumors about his location and identity have circulated since the 1960s. Pynchon's most recent novel, Bleeding Edge, was published on September 17, 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Pynchon> .

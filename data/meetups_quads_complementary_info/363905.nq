<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rik_Mayall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Michael Mayall (7 March 1958 â€“ 9 June 2014) was an English actor, stand-up comedian and writer. He formed a close partnership with Ade Edmondson while they were students at Manchester University and was a pioneer of alternative comedy in the 1980s. Mayall starred in numerous successful comedy series throughout his career, including The Young Ones, The Comic Strip Presents..., Blackadder, Filthy Rich & Catflap, The New Statesman, Bottom and Believe Nothing. Mayall also starred in the comedy films Drop Dead Fred and Guest House Paradiso; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for his voice-over work in The Willows in Winter. His comedic style was described as energetic \"post-punk\". Mayall died suddenly at his home in London on 9 June 2014 at the age of 56. BBC Television director Danny Cohen praised him as a \"truly brilliant\" comedian with a unique stage presence, whose \"fireball creativity\" and approach to sitcom had inspired a generation of comedy stars." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rik_Mayall> .

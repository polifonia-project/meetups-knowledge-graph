According to Stereogum, Brion's work on Mann's first solo albums \"lay the groundwork for a sound that became synonymous with a strain of notable alternative acts at the turn of the century\". Brion's film scores include Hard Eight (1996), Magnolia (1999), Punch-Drunk Love (2002), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I Heart Huckabees (both 2004), Synecdoche, New York (2008), ParaNorman (2012), Lady Bird (2017), and Christopher Robin (2018).

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gail_Ann_Dorsey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gail Ann Dorsey (born November 20, 1962) is an American musician. With a long career as a session musician mainly on bass guitar, she is perhaps best known for her lengthy residency in David Bowie's band, from 1995 to Bowie's death in 2016. Aside from playing bass, she sang lead vocals on live versions of \"Under Pressure\" (taking the part originally sung by Queen frontman Freddie Mercury) and dueted with Bowie on other songs, including \"The London Boys\", \"Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)\", \"I Dig Everything\", accompanying Bowie on clarinet, and a cover of Laurie Anderson's \"O Superman\". From 1993 to 1996, Dorsey also recorded and toured with Tears for Fears, and collaborated on songwriting with the band. She appeared in several of the band's promo videos throughout this period. Her diverse range of work includes performances and recordings with, among others, The National, Lenny Kravitz, Bryan Ferry, Boy George, the Indigo Girls, Khaled, Jane Siberry, The The, Skin, Gwen Stefani, Charlie Watts, Seal, Gang of Four, Susan Werner, Ani DiFranco and Dar Williams. In addition, Dorsey has released three solo albums: The Corporate World (1988), Rude Blue (1992), and I Used To Be... (2003)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gail_Ann_Dorsey> .

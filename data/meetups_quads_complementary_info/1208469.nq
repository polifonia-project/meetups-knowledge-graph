<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_Yauch> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Adam Nathaniel Yauch (pronounced /jaʊk/; August 5, 1964 – May 4, 2012), better known under the stage name MCA, was an American rapper, bass player, filmmaker and a founding member of the hip hop group Beastie Boys. Besides his musical work, he also directed many of the band's music videos and did much of their promotional photography, often using the pseudonym Nathaniel Hörnblowér for such work. Yauch founded Oscilloscope Laboratories, an independent film production and distribution company based in New York City. As a Buddhist, he was involved in the Tibetan independence movement and organized the Tibetan Freedom Concert. He died in 2012 from parotid cancer, after which Beastie Boys ceased making music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_Yauch> .

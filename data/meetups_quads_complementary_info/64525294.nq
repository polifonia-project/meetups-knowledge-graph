He was the father of Dalibor Cyril Vačkář, who was also a notable Czech composer. He is well known for his marches especially for his March “Šohaj” which is well known in his native Czechia. Vačkář is also a very prolific composer with over 300 original pieces of music. Vačkář received military training in Przemyśl, Poland from 1895-1898 during which he began learning about music through a military program. After his time in Poland Váckář began to play and conduct in various local orchestras including the Czech Philharmonic. In 1952 he wrote the book “Instrumentace Symfonického Orchestru a Hudby Dechové” (Instrumentation for the Symphony Orchestra and Wind Music) with his aforementioned son Dalibor Cyril Vačkář which is still taught in Czech conservatories." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Václav_Vačkář> .

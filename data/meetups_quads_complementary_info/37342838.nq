<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Berry_(poet)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Berry, OBE, Hon FRSL (28 September 1924 â€“ 20 June 2017), was a Jamaican poet who settled in England in the 1940s. His poetry is notable for using a mixture of standard English and Jamaican Patois. Berry's writing often \"explores the relationship between black and white communities and in particular, the excitement and tensions in the evolving relationship of the Caribbean immigrants with Britain and British society from the 1940s onwards\". As the editor of two seminal anthologies, Bluefoot Traveller (1976) and News for Babylon (1984), he was in the forefront of championing West Indian/British writing." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Berry_(poet)> .

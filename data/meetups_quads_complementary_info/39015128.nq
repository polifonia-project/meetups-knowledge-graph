He played on many early Daptone Records releases and, with his bands The Daktaris and Antibalas, helped inspire new interest in Nigerian funk and afrobeat music in America during the late nineties. After becoming a Hasidic Jew in 2004, he returned to New York and formed several bands with musicians in the local Jewish community, most notably the hardcore punk band Moshiach Oi!." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Wagner_(musician)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuki_Saito_(actress)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Yuki Saito (Japanese: 斉藤 由貴, romanized: Saitō Yuki; born September 10, 1966 in Minami-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture) is a Japanese actress, singer and narrator. She attended Kanagawa Prefectural Shimizugaoka High School (now Yokohama Seiryo Sogo High School). She is well known in Japan for being a member of LDS Church, as she refuses to work on Sundays. Saito used a fake cigarette while filming the 1986 film Koisuru Onnatachi due to her beliefs. In 1985, after making her singing debut with her single Sotsugyō and her debut album, Axia, she was cast in the lead role of Saki Asamiya in the first Sukeban Deka television drama series. She later revisited that story by playing Saki's mother in the 2006 movie, Sukeban Deka: Codename = Asamiya Saki. She has starred in and been cast in many television and film dramas and comedies, and has also done voice-over narration work. Saito has released 21 singles and 13 original albums. She has also released a live album, eight \"best of\" compilation albums, and has been featured on five tribute albums where she covered songs by The Carpenters, songs from Walt Disney films, and others. Her father owns an obi shop in Yokohama, and her brother is the actor Ryūji Saitō." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuki_Saito_(actress)> .

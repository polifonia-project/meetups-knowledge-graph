He is the only son of country singers Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter. In a career spanning over two decades, Shooter Jennings has explored a variety of genres as part of his eclectic sound, including southern rock, country, hard rock, blues rock, electronica and rock and roll. Jennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album “Put the \"O\" Back in Country” on Universal South, which peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard country charts.

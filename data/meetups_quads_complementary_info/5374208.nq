He appeared on their critically acclaimed 1968 debut album, Child Is Father to the Man. Weiss left soon afterwards to help form the short-lived horn-band, Ambergris, where he played bass guitar and piano and was the principal arranger. He also contributed three songs on the album and co-wrote another. Weiss has made infrequent appearances on recordings by other artists, including Al Kooper, a fellow Blood, Sweat & Tears member." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Weiss> .

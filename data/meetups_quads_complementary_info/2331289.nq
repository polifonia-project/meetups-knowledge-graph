<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Einhorn> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Einhorn (born 1952) is an American composer of contemporary classical music. Einhorn graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University in 1975, and studied composition and electronic music with Jack Beeson, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and Mario Davidovsky. His best-known work, Voices of Light (1994) is an oratorio scored for soloists, chorus, orchestra and a bell. It was inspired by Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), and it has been performed while the film is screened. He has also composed many horror and thriller film scores, including Shock Waves (1977), Don't Go in the House (1980), Eyes of a Stranger (1981), The Prowler (1981), Dead of Winter (1987), Blood Rage (1987), Sister, Sister (1987) and Dark Tower (1989). He also contributed to the soundtrack of Liberty! The American Revolution (1997). In a 2011 New York Times article, Einhorn discussed his use of hearing loops to enjoy concerts with his hearing aid." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Einhorn> .

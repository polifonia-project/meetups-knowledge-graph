Úlfur's first album, Sweaty Psalms, was released in May 2008. It was recorded and written over two years, self-released but distributed by Kimi Records locally. The record received outstanding reviews in local newspapers and webzines, for example, being voted the seventh best album of 2008 by rjominn.is. In promotion of the album, Klive toured Germany in 2009, opening for Kira Kira. Following the success of Klive's first album, Úlfur signed a record deal with newly reformed Mille Plateaux. Úlfur Hansson has worked closely with his sibling and visual artist, Elín Hansdóttir, over the years. He also plays bass guitar with the Icelandic band Swords of Chaos. Since April 2010, Úlfur Hansson has been a touring member of Jónsi (Jón Þór Birgisson of Sigur Rós) international promotional tour of Jónsi's album Go." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Klive> .

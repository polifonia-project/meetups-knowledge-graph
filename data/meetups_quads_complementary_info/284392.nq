<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isao_Tomita> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Isao Tomita (冨田 勲, Tomita Isao, 22 April 1932 – 5 May 2016), often known simply as Tomita, was a Japanese composer, regarded as one of the pioneers of electronic music and space music, and as one of the most famous producers of analog synthesizer arrangements. In addition to creating note-by-note realizations, Tomita made extensive use of the sound-design capabilities of his instrument, using synthesizers to create new sounds to accompany and enhance his electronic realizations of acoustic instruments. He also made effective use of analog music sequencers and the Mellotron, and featured futuristic science-fiction themes, while laying the foundations for synth-pop music and trance-like rhythms. Many of his albums are electronic versions and adaptations of familiar classical music pieces. He received four Grammy Award nominations for his 1974 album based on music by Claude Debussy, Snowflakes Are Dancing." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isao_Tomita> .

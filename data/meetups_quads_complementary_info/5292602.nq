His music is composed mainly of recordings from shortwave radio, field recordings and voice. His events and installations are a form of existential research, often confrontational in nature. Duncan currently lives in (and operates out of) Bologna, Italy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Duncan_(artist)> .

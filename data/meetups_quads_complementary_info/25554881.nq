<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Ngozi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul Ngozi (1949–1989), born Paul Dobson Nyirongo, was a Zambian musician who was prominent in the Zambian music scene in the 1970s and 1980s. He first became popular as the band leader of the Ngozi Family, a top local rock group which was one of the first groups to have its music classified as Zamrock. He earned his place as a ‘sharp’ social commentator because the themes of his music were usually very close to society’s own lives and therefore easy to relate to." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Ngozi> .

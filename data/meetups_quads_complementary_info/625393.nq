<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dizzy_Reed> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Darren Arthur Reed (born June 18, 1963), better known by his stage name Dizzy Reed, is an American musician and occasional actor. He is best known as the keyboardist for the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he has played, toured, and recorded since 1990. Aside from lead singer Axl Rose, Reed is the longest-standing member of Guns N' Roses, and was the only member of the band to remain from their Use Your Illusion era until the 2016 return of guitarist Slash and bass guitarist Duff McKagan. In 2012, Reed was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N' Roses, although he did not attend the ceremony. He was also a member of the Australian-American supergroup The Dead Daisies with his Guns N' Roses bandmate Richard Fortus, ex-Whitesnake member Marco Mendoza, ex-Mötley Crüe frontman John Corabi and session drummer Brian Tichy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dizzy_Reed> .

He played in several punk bands, including Old Skull, while still in high-school. He released his first solo album in 2003. While retaining the punk attitude and political awareness Lindsey's music had since evolved and exposed his folk and country roots, to create a mix of folk, alternative country, Americana & country noir. He has since released two more albums, one EP and contributed to several compilations. Four of Lindsey's songs were used in the direct-to-DVD film Fairview St., released in 2010. His song \"Emma Rumble\" was used in the direct-to-DVD film Dunsmore, released in 2004. Lindsey lives in Montana and performs with his wife Tina Lindsey." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Lindsey> .

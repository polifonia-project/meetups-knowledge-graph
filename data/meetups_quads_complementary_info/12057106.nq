<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_P._Hill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lieutenant Commander Roger Percival Hill, DSO, DSC, (22 June 1910 â€“ 5 May 2001) was a commander in many famous destroyers of the Royal Navy during the Second World War. Hill served in crucial theatres of the war, being present in the Arctic convoys, the Mediterranean Campaign and Malta Convoys, as well as playing a supporting role aboard HMS Jervis during the Normandy landings. Hill's first command, HMS Ledbury played a part in the success of Operation Pedestal, the convoy to resupply the beleaguered island of Malta. The Ledbury propped up the crucial oil tanker SS Ohio after it was hit and successively torpedoed by Axis forces, and nursed it to reach the Grand Harbour, Valletta." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_P._Hill> .

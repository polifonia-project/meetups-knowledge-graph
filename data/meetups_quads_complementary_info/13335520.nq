<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ana_Tijoux> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anamaría Tijoux Merino (French: [tiʒu]; born 12 June 1977), commonly known by her stage name Ana Tijoux or Anita Tijoux, is a Chilean-French singer and musician. She became famous in Latin America as the MC of hip-hop group Makiza during the late 1990s. In 2006, she crossed over to the mainstream of Latin pop after her collaboration with Mexican songstress Julieta Venegas in the radio hit \"Eres para mí\". Tijoux has often been praised for \"exploring sensitive matters devoid of violence.\" She gained more widespread recognition following her second solo album, 1977, and later with La bala (2011) and Vengo (2014) which brought her a Best Artist of the year award in the 2015's Premios Pulsar. Tijoux is the daughter of Chilean parents living in political exile in France during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ana_Tijoux> .

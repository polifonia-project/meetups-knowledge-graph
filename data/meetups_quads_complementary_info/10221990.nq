Scott began playing keyboard instruments at six years old. He first taught himself how to play, but was later trained professionally at Dick Grove School of Music. In addition to Dio, Warren has worked with the bands Warrant, Keel, Berlin, and Heaven & Hell, the latter of which also featured Ronnie James Dio. Today Warren is part of the band Dio Disciples, which includes surviving members of the final line-up of Dio, along with former Lynch Mob vocalist Oni Logan. He also plays in the band Hellion, alongside fellow Dio Disciples member Simon Wright." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scott_Warren> .

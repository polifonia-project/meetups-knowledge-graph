<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Battista_Rubini> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Giovanni Battista Rubini (7 April 1794 – 3 March 1854) was an Italian tenor, as famous in his time as Enrico Caruso in a later day. His ringing and expressive coloratura dexterity in the highest register of his voice, the tenorino, inspired the writing of operatic roles which today are almost impossible to cast. As a singer Rubini was the major early exponent of the Romantic style of the bel canto era of Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti. Rubini is remembered as an extraordinary bel canto singer, one of the most famous in Europe in the 1820s to 1840s. He also popularized the use of a pervasive vibrato as a means of heightening the emotional impact of his operatic performances. However, if his upper register was exceptional—he could effortlessly go up to a \"ringing\" high F (F5) (a note that most tenors today escape because of their \"chesty\" technique), he was reported as barely audible in the others parts of his voice and his tone was \"slightly veiled\". He also had a limited volume control, struggling to produce mezzo-forte or mezzo-piano dynamics. On the other hand, he was admired for the \"infectious\" joy he took to sing, his great agility and refined musicianship." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Battista_Rubini> .

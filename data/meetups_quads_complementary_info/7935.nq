<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_D._Friedman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Director Friedman (born February 12, 1945) is an American economist, physicist, legal scholar, and anarcho-capitalist theorist, described by Walter Block as a \"free-market anarchist\". Although he studied chemistry and physics and not law or economics, he is known for his textbook writings on microeconomics and the libertarian theory of anarcho-capitalism, which is the subject of his most popular book, The Machinery of Freedom. He has also authored several other books and articles, including Price Theory: An Intermediate Text (1986), Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters (2000), Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life (1996), and Future Imperfect (2008)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_D._Friedman> .

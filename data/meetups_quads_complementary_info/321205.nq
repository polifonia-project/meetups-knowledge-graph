<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzy_Parker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Suzy Parker (born Cecilia Ann Renee Parker; October 28, 1932 â€“ May 3, 2003) was an American model and actress active from 1947 until 1970. Her modeling career reached its zenith during the 1950s, when she appeared on the covers of dozens of magazines and in advertisements and movie and television roles. She appeared in advertisements for Revlon and many other cosmetic companies, including Solo Products, the largest hair care product company in the country at the time. (Models did not have exclusive cosmetic company contracts until Lauren Hutton and Karen Graham in the early 1970s). In 1956, at the height of her modelling career, she became the first model to earn $100,000 per year ($997,000 today). A song that The Beatles wrote for her, though not released on record, appeared in their 1970 documentary film Let It Be, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Score." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzy_Parker> .

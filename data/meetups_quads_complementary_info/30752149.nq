He released his first single, \"Lifestyle of a Mack\", on his independent record label Realside Records in 1992. He released his debut studio album, Heat 4 Yo Azz, in 1994, and released a second album, Killa Kali, two years later. In 1996, he appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD, America is Dying Slowly, alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as \"a masterpiece\" by The Source magazine. His next appearance wasn't until 1998, with his third album: The G Filez. Deep Conversation followed in mid-2000. Celly has collaborated with fellow Bay Area rappers E-40 & B-Legit on several occasions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celly_Cel> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoo_Jae-ha> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Yoo Jae-ha (Korean: 유재하; Hanja: 柳在夏; June 6, 1962 – November 1, 1987) was a South Korean singer and songwriter. His first and only album, Because I Love You (Korean: 사랑하기 때문에) was released through Seoul Records in 1987. Yoo died in a car accident months later from the album release at age 25. Even though he died with only one album, Yoo Jae-ha's music has a great legacy in South Korea, and it is credited with exerting tremendous influence in Korean popular music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoo_Jae-ha> .

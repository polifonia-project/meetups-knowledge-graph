<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Backwards_Sam_Firk> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Addison Stewart (September 18, 1943 â€“ October 11, 2007), who performed and recorded as Backwards Sam Firk, was an American country blues singer, fingerstyle guitarist, songwriter, and record collector. Less well known than such contemporaries as Alan Wilson of Canned Heat and John Fahey, Backwards Sam Firk spent much of his music-based existence working with and supporting older blues artists. According to his friend Stephan Michelson, \"He was, simply put, masterful. More than technique, he had taste. And more than technique and taste, he had originality. From his mentors and from records he did not so much copy notes as learn sounds and how to make them. He played old-time blues as if he was living in the 1930s, as if this was the music of his day. For him, it was.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Backwards_Sam_Firk> .

She has attained the most US Billboard 200 top-five albums in the 21st century by a female artist, with a total of thirteen entries. Cyrus, a daughter of country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus, emerged as a teen idol while portraying the title character of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006–2011). As Hannah Montana, she attained two number-one and three top-five soundtracks on the US Billboard 200, including the US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten single \"He Could Be the One\". Cyrus's own discography includes the US number-one albums Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), Breakout (2008), and Bangerz (2013); the top-five releases Can't Be Tamed (2010), Younger Now (2017), Plastic Hearts (2020), and the free album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015). Cyrus's EPs The Time of Our Lives (2009) and She Is Coming (2019) also debuted in the top-five.

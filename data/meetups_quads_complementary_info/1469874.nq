<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fernando_Villalona> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Fernando Villalona, the first artist named \"El Mayimbe\" (born in Loma de Cabrera, Dajabón Province on May 7, 1955, Ramón Fernando Villalona Évora), is a Dominican merengue singer who began singing in the early 1970s, his popularity started to grow by the late 1970s and has not declined ever since. Songs such as \"Tabaco y Ron,\" \"Celos,\" \"Te Amo Demasiado,\" \"La Hamaquita,\" \"Dominicano Soy,\" \"Sonámbulo,\" and \"Carnaval\" among others became popular in the 1980s. \"Quisqueya,\" \"No Podrás,\" \"Música Latina,\" \"Retorno,\" and \"Me he Enamorado\" were some of his biggest hits in the 1990s. In recent years he has had some health problems making performing a difficult task. But besides the fact that he has not been able to perform frequently, he probably still is the most important merengue singer in Dominican history. He was married to Evelyn Jorge a woman of Puerto Rican origin and they have a daughter named Paloma." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fernando_Villalona> .

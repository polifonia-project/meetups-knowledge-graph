He joined Rancid in November 1991 and left 15 years later. He played on every Rancid release up to their 2003 album Indestructible. On November 3, 2006, his announcement of leaving Rancid was made public and he was replaced by Branden Steineckert. He has not been active in the music industry since this time. He plays left-handed. He has also played acoustic guitar on a number of Rancid acoustic shows, but unlike drums, he plays guitar right-handed.

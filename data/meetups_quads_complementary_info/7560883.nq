<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peadar_O'Loughlin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peadar O'Loughlin (6 November 1929 – 22 October 2017) was an Irish fluter, fiddler, and piper from Kilmaley County Clare, Ireland who had been a fixture in Irish music since the late 1940s and was best known for having played on the highly influential 1959 LP \"\" (with Paddy Canny, , and ), which was one of the first LPs of Irish traditional music. He performed in the Tulla Céilí Band and Kilfenora Céilí Band and recorded duet albums with piper Ronan Browne and fiddler Maeve Donnelly. His unique flute style earned him All-Ireland champion titles in 1956 and 1957. It is characterized by strong rhythmic flow with sparse ornamentation, occasionally punctuated by unusually long silences which emphasize the rhythmic structure of the tunes." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peadar_O'Loughlin> .

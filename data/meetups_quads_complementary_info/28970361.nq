<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alec_Burks> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alec Burks (born July 20, 1991) is an American professional basketball player for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected by the Utah Jazz as the 12th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft. Burks primarily plays the shooting guard position. He played for the Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball team during his college years and was most notably the school's first-ever Big 12 Conference Freshman of the Year in 2010. As a sophomore, Burks was statistically the eighteenth-best scorer in the Division I. With Colorado, he missed only a single college game. Burks also gained national attention after being selected to the Big 12 First Team in his second season with the Buffaloes. He entered the 2011 NBA draft shortly after his sophomore year, projected to be a first-round draft pick despite playing just two seasons at Colorado." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alec_Burks> .

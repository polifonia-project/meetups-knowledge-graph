She embarked on her music career with R&B girl group Sista in the early-mid 1990s and later became a member of the Swing Mob collective along with childhood friend and longtime collaborator Timbaland, with whom she worked on projects for American R&B acts Aaliyah, 702, Total, and SWV. Following several collaborations and guest appearances, she launched her solo career in 1997 with her debut album Supa Dupa Fly, which spawned the top 20 single \"Sock It 2 Me\". The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, the highest charting debut for a female rapper at the time. Elliott's second album, Da Real World, was released in 1999 and produced the singles \"She's a Bitch\", \"All n My Grill\", and top five hit \"Hot Boyz\". The remix of the latter song broke the record for most weeks at number-one on the US R&B chart on the issue dated January 15, 2000, as well as spending 18 weeks at number one on the Hot Rap Singles chart from December 1999 to March 2000. With the release of Miss E... So Addictive (2001), Under Construction (2002), and This Is Not a Test (2003), Elliott established an international career that yielded hits including \"Get Ur Freak On\", \"One Minute Man\", \"4 My People\", \"Gossip Folks\", and \"Work It\". The latter won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance. She released her first extended play, titled Iconology in 2019. Elliott has been referred to as the \"Queen of Rap\" by media outlets. She has sold over 30 million records in the United States. Her accolades include four Grammy Awards. She is the best-selling female rapper in Nielsen Music history, according to Billboard in 2017. She became the first female rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and received the MTV VMAs Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for her impact on the music video landscape. In 2020, Billboard ranked her at number five on the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time. In 2021, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missy_Elliott> .

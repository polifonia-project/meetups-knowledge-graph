He was a Monuments Man during the Second World War, then deputy director of London's Tate Gallery and secretary of the Royal Academy from 1952 to 1968. Serious depression in his 50s led to his early retirement, after which he became \"an internationally acknowledged expert on roses\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humphrey_Brooke_(art_historian)> .

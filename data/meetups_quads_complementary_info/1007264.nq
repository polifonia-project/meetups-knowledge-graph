He was known for drawing public attention to choral music through his wide-ranging influence and mentoring of younger conductors, the high standard of his recordings, his support for racial integration in his choruses, and his support for modern music, winning many awards throughout his career." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Shaw_(conductor)> .

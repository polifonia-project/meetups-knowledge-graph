<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrea_Della_Corte> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Andrea Della Corte was an Italian musicologist and critic. Born in Naples on 5 April 1883, Della Corte studied law at the University of the native city, but was self-taught in music. After some short experiences in Neapolitan papers (initially at the Don Marzio, then at Il Mattino), he moved to Turin, where he was music critic for La Stampa from 1919 to May 1967. He brought the music journalism in Italy to a level of «professionalism hitherto unknown». In Turin, Della Corte also taught history of music, both at the Conservatory (1926–53) and at the University (1939–53). His main interests were the comic opera of the 18th century, Gluck and Verdi. Della Corte wrote many essays and articles, and 35 books, published both in Italy and abroad, many of them considered of fundamental importance for the modern musicology, characterised by a severe musical judgment and by the attempt to innovate the world of the Italian musical studies. He was a member of important musical and cultural institutions (Accademia dei Lincei, Accademia dei Cherubini in Florence, Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Istituto Italiano per la Storia della Musica). Della Corte died in Turin on 12 March 1968, aged 84. The city of Turin dedicated to Andrea Della Corte the music section of the Civic Library, to which his family, after his death, donated over 15,000 books." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrea_Della_Corte> .

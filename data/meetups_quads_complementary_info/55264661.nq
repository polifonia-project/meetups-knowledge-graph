<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ayako_Uehara_(golfer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ayako Uehara (上原 彩子, Uehara Ayako, born 23 December 1983 in Naha, Okinawa) is a Japanese professional golfer. Uehara started playing golf at age 12, turned professional in 2003, and made her way onto the LPGA Tour on her first attempt. Together with Ai Miyazato and Sakura Yokomine, she was a member of the Japanese team that won a silver medal at the 2002 Asian Games. In 2016, Uehara made two holes-in-one during the Canadian Pacific Women's Open, tying the LPGA record for most holes-in-one in a single tournament. In November the same year, she set another record when she posted a score of 141 during round one of the Ito En Ladies Golf Tournament on the LPGA of Japan Tour. Uehara mistakenly applied the local rule of \"lift, clean, and place\" (common on the LPGA) when it should have been \"lift, clean, and replace\", earning her 68 penalties, two for each of the 19 violations and one for each of the 15 holes with an incorrect score on her scorecard. Uehara, in solo second place just one shot off of the lead, played in the final group at a major championship for the first time in her career at the 2017 Evian Championship." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ayako_Uehara_(golfer)> .

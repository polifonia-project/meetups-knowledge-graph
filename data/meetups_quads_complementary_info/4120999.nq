A midfielder, he began his playing career with Manchester City and then moved to Leeds United, where he scored 47 league goals in 230 appearances. He played for Nottingham Forest briefly, under the management of Brian Clough, and then joined Sheffield Wednesday, for whom he scored the winning goal in the 1991 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. Near the end of his time with the club, he played for Birmingham City and Bolton Wanderers on loan before joining the latter permanently. Sheridan made 199 league appearances for Wednesday and scored 25 goals. He won the First Division title with Bolton in 1997. Sheridan then played for Doncaster Rovers after leaving Bolton and then joined Oldham Athletic, where he spent the last six years of his playing career, scoring 14 league goals in 144 appearances. He played international football for the Republic of Ireland, for whom he won 34 caps and scored five goals over a seven-year period. Having been included in the Republic's squad for UEFA Euro 1988, Sheridan went on to play one game at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and four in the 1994 tournament. He became Oldham's manager in 2006, having served as caretaker twice during his time as an Oldham player. Sheridan left the club in 2009, having spent more than ten years there as a player, coach and manager. He joined Chesterfield later that year, where he achieved success in league and cup competition. Sheridan was next Plymouth Argyle manager from 2013 to 2015, and then had a succession of short-lived managerial positions, including spells at Newport County, Oldham (thrice more), Notts County, Fleetwood Town, Carlisle United, Chesterfield (again), Waterford, Wigan Athletic and Swindon Town." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Sheridan_(footballer)> .

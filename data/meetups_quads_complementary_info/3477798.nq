He then entered the world of radio and television in the early 1990s, actively writing scripts for and participating in various comedy skits during the annual Norooz comedy television shows broadcast by the IRIB. He achieved real stardom with his creation of Pavarchin (Tiptoeing), in which he won numerous awards for directing and starring in the picture. He tasted success again when he directed and starred in Noghtechin (Ellipsis), and Jayezeye Bozorg (The Grand Prize), which became major hits on television in Iran. Later, he followed Pavarchin's storyline with the making of Shabhaye Barareh which became his most popular television program yet; the show remained incomplete after it was criticized for offending rural people. This resulted in an abrupt end to the show after 92 episodes without completely explaining the Barareh history. He starred in two full-length films and had planned on entering the film industry once again after Shabhaye Barareh was completed. However, he instead produced and released his next project, the television series Baghe Mozaffar. One of his most popular tv series was , broadcast in 2008.

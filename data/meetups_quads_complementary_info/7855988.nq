<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kadir_Nelson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kadir Nelson (May 15, 1974) is a Los Angeles–based painter, illustrator, and author who is best known for his paintings often featured on the covers of The New Yorker magazine, and album covers for Michael Jackson and Drake. His work is focused on African-American culture and history. The New York Times describes his work as: \"sumptuous, deeply affecting work. Nelson’s paintings are drenched in ambience, and often overt symbolism. He has twice been a Caldecott honor recipient and won the 2020 Caldecott Medal for his book The Undefeated." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kadir_Nelson> .

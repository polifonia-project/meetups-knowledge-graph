Signed to MCA Nashville Records in 1992, Byrd broke through on the country music scene that year with his 1993 single \"Holdin' Heaven\", which reached Number One on Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks. Although he did not land a second Number One until 2002's \"Ten Rounds with Jose Cuervo\", Byrd has charted more than thirty hit singles in his career, including eleven additional Top Ten hits. He has also released ten studio albums and two greatest-hits albums, with four gold certifications and one double-platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. He was the on-air spokesman for the TNN Outdoors block from 1998 to 2000." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tracy_Byrd> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Bannon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Charles Bannon AO (7 May 1943 â€“ 13 December 2015) was an Australian politician and academic. He was the 39th Premier of South Australia, leading the South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party from a single term in opposition back to government at the 1982 election. At the 1985 election Bannon's government was re-elected with an increased majority, but it was reduced to minority government status at the 1989 election. In 1992 Bannon became Labor's longest-serving and South Australia's second longest-serving Premier. As a result of the State Bank collapse, he resigned as Premier in 1992, and from parliament at the 1993 election landslide. He was also an academic and the Head of St Mark's College." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Bannon> .

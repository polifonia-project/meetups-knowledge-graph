<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Merrill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alan Merrill (born Allan Preston Sachs; February 19, 1951 â€“ March 29, 2020) was an American vocalist, guitarist and songwriter. In the early 1970s, he was one of the few resident foreigners to achieve pop star status in Japan. He was the writer of, and lead singer on, the first released version of the song \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", which was recorded by his band the Arrows in 1975. The song became a breakthrough hit for Joan Jett in 1982. Merrill was primarily a vocalist and songwriter, but also played the guitar, bass guitar, harmonica, and keyboards. He died during the COVID-19 pandemic due to complications brought on by the virus." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Merrill> .

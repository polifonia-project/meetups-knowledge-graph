<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marc_Storace> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Marc Storace (Sto-rah-che) (born 7 October 1951) is a Maltese born rock vocalist. His career in music started in the 1960s. He is most noted for his position as frontman, lead singer and songwriter of Swiss hard rock band Krokus from 1980. Before joining Krokus he sang with the Swiss Prog Rockers TEA. He has since also undertaken a solo project, duets, an acoustical project, and many guest slots. He also had some close encounters with the classical meets rock world and has worked with a few other rock acts as writer and a singer. Marc has a high pitched raunchy voice, making him a very distinct vocalist, and has been compared, according to most music-journalists, to AC/DC's former lead singer Bon Scott or Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant in terms of vocal style. Since he began singing professionally in the 1970s, his style and voice have remained largely the same, with a noticeable increase of character, through maturity and years of live and studio experience. Marc played a major role in the Swiss-German films Anuk and Handyman, in which he acted, as well as contributed his writing and singing to songs for both the film's soundtracks. Today, January 2019, Marc is still active in rock projects as well as his \"ongoing\" semi-acoustic one. Krokus will embark on their \"Farewell Tour\" this April." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marc_Storace> .

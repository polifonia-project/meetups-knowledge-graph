His self-titled EP released in 2012 included the song \"How Bad We Need Each Other\" which was featured in the hit television series Bones. In 2015, Scibilia's version of Woody Guthrie's folk classic \"This Land Is Your Land\" was featured in Jeep's \"Beautiful Lands\" Super Bowl commercial. The ad fared well, making Scibilia one of the most Shazam-ed artists of the telecast and led to mentions in several publications. His debut album, Out Of Style, was released on October 30, 2015, amidst tours with James Bay, Zac Brown Band and ZZ Ward as well as an appearance on The Today Show. Scibilia collaborated with German musician, DJ and producer Robin Schulz in 2017 for Schulz's fourth single \"Unforgettable\" off of his album Uncovered.

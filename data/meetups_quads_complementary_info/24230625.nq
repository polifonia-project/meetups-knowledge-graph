He has been signed to Parlophone Records since 2009, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group. He created his own entertainment company Disturbing London in 2006, along with his cousin Dumi Oburota. After releasing a number of mixtapes, he released his debut album, Disc-Overy, in October 2010. Preceded by two British number-one singles, \"Pass Out\" and \"Written in the Stars\", the album charted at number one and was certified Platinum the next year. In February 2011, he won two Brit Awards for Best British Breakthrough Act and Best British Single. In November 2013, he released his second album, entitled Demonstration.

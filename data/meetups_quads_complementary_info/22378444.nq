She rose to fame in 2009 after appearing as a contestant on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, singing \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from Les Misérables. Boyle's debut studio album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009; it became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis, and set a record for first-week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Charts Company. In her first year of fame, Boyle made £5 million (£7.1 million today) with the release of I Dreamed a Dream and its lead-off singles, \"I Dreamed a Dream\" and \"Wild Horses\". The success continued with her second studio album, The Gift (2010), where she became only the third act ever to top both the UK and US album charts twice in the same year, and was followed by Boyle's third studio album, Someone to Watch Over Me (2011). She subsequently released the studio albums Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs from the Stage (2012), Home for Christmas (2013), Hope (2014), A Wonderful World (2016), and Ten (2019). On 12 May 2012, Boyle returned to Britain's Got Talent to perform as a guest in the final, singing \"You'll See\". The following day, she performed at Windsor Castle for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Pageant singing \"Mull of Kintyre\". Having performed \"I Know Him So Well\" in a duet with one of her idols Elaine Paige in London in December 2009, Boyle performed with her other musical idol Donny Osmond in Las Vegas in November 2012, singing \"This is the Moment\", a duet from her fourth album. She is known for supporting various charitable causes, and has appeared on the UK charity telethons BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief. As of 2013, Boyle had sold over 19 million albums worldwide and received two Grammy Awards nominations. On 23 July 2014, she performed \"Mull of Kintyre\" at the Opening Ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in front of the Queen. To date, Boyle has released eight albums, including two Christmas releases, The Gift and A Wonderful World. In 2019, Boyle celebrated ten years in showbiz, with a compilation album titled Ten and a tour. As of 2021, Boyle has sold 25 million records. Her debut album, I Dreamed A Dream (2009), is one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century, having sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and it was the best-selling album internationally in 2009." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susan_Boyle> .

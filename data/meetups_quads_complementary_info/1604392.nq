<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tito_Santana> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Merced Solis (born May 10, 1953), better known by the ring name Tito Santana, is a retired American professional wrestler and middle school teacher. Santana has stayed a babyface his entire career and he is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation between 1979 and 1993 (missing part of 1980 and returning in 1983) where he was twice the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and twice held the WWF Tag Team Championship. He also won the 1989 King of the Ring tournament and wrestled at all of the first nine WrestleMania events, as well as helping bridge the gap between the 1980s \"Rock 'n Wrestling Connection\" era to the 1990s \"New Generation\" era. Santana was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004. During his time in the WWF, Santana, despite being born and raised in Texas, was billed from \"Tocula, Mexico\", which may be a misspelled reference to the city of Toluca. To this day, he still appears on the independent circuit." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tito_Santana> .

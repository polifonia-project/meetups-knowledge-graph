<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Sarnoff> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert W. Sarnoff (July 2, 1918 – February 23, 1997) was an American businessman best known as the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Radio Corporation of America (RCA) after assuming those positions on the retirement of his father, David Sarnoff. During his rise through the company's ranks, he was best known for his advocacy of color television. Through the early 1970s, Sarnoff attempted to build RCA into a multinational conglomerate which included rental cars, carpet manufacturing, book publishing and sold frozen vegetables. Focus on RCA's core technology businesses waned and also resulted in the selling of their computer division at a massive financial loss. The company's new direction was not particularly successful, and RCA struggled during the 1973–1975 recession. After five years as chairman, a \"palace revolt\" by the board and senior RCA executives removed Sarnoff from the CEO position. After Sarnoff's unsuccessful tenure, RCA never recovered its former stature and was purchased by General Electric in 1986, which liquidated most of the company's assets. Sarnoff died in 1997 after a struggle with cancer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Sarnoff> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Pratt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Pratt (21 March 1923 â€“ 11 January 1995) was an English actor and singer. He was best known for his comic roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. Pratt started his career in the chorus of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1945, moving up to small roles and then understudying Martyn Green, the principal comedian. From 1951 to 1959, he was the company's principal comedian, earning critical praise in the famous \"patter\" roles. After leaving the company, he moved on to a career in theatre, television, concert and radio, although he continued to perform the Gilbert and Sullivan roles throughout his career. Among his television roles Pratt was the second actor to play the Master in the science fiction series Doctor Who." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Pratt> .

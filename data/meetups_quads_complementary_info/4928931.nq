Anderson's playing was rooted in the swing music and hard bop idioms, but he also incorporated innovations from free jazz. Anderson was also noted for having mentored numerous young musicians. Critic Ben Ratliff called him \"a father figure of experimental jazz in Chicago\". Writer John Corbett referred to him as \"scene caretaker, underground booster, indefatigable cultural worker, quiet force for good.\" In 2001, author John Litweiler called Anderson \"the finest tenor saxophonist in free jazz/underground jazz/outside jazz today.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Anderson_(musician)> .

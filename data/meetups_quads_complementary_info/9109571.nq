<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McCoy_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Matthew McCoy (born 9 March 1950, in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England), is an English bass guitarist, who is best known for his work with Ian Gillan and Mammoth as well as numerous other bands and sessions since the late 1960s. He also played in British rock trio Guy McCoy Tormé with former Gillan/Ozzy guitarist Bernie Tormé and Bruce Dickinson/Sack Trick drummer Robin Guy. He is also an accomplished guitar, drum, trumpet, cello, and double bass player. Nearly as well known as his music is his appearance: he is always pictured wearing sunglasses, with the striking contrast of bald head and robust chin beard. Along with guitarist Vic Elmes and ZZebra colleague Liam Genockey on drums, McCoy can also be heard playing in the intro and end titles theme of the 1970s cult TV series Space: 1999." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McCoy_(musician)> .

A member of ARS from 1971-1979, he co-wrote several of their songs including the top-ten hits \"So Into You\" and \"Imaginary Lover\". Nix grew up in Jacksonville, Florida and graduated from Paxon Senior High School in 1962. He got his start as a member of Roy Orbison's backing band The Candymen, and also played on recordings for artists including The Classics IV, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Al Kooper.

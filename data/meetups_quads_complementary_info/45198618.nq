He is best known as a firefighter who won the fourth series of the BBC television singing competition The Voice UK in 2015, where he auditioned with Kodaline's \"All I Want\", with all four coaches turning their chairs for him. His debut single, \"Lost Stars\", was released the day following his win, peaking at number one on the Scottish Singles Chart and number six on the UK Singles Chart. After winning The Voice, he performed at T in The Park in 2015. In January 2016, McCrorie released his second album, Big World which reached number four on the Scottish Albums Chart and number thirty-five on the UK Albums Chart. McCrorie and his record label parted company soon thereafter and McCrorie resumed his former career as a firefighter whilst still touring and releasing music as an independent artist.

His winners single, \"Lost Stars\" is currently the highest charting and best-selling single in the United Kingdom from a The Voice UK winner, charting at number six on the UK Singles Chart and selling 62,000 copies." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_McCrorie> .

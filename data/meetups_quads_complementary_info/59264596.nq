<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hazel_Smith> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hazel Ruth Boone, also known as Hazel Smith (May 31, 1934 â€“ March 18, 2018) was an American country music journalist, publicist, singer-songwriter, television and radio show host, and cookbook author. She is sometimes credited with creating the term \"outlaw country,\" which has been used to describe country music by performers including Tompall & the Glaser Brothers, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. Smith worked as a publicist for country musicians beginning in the late 1960s while simultaneously writing and recording her own music. She wrote columns about country music for several publications, and she hosted radio and television shows about country music, cooking, and film. She also published a cookbook called Hazel's Hot Dish in 2001." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hazel_Smith> .

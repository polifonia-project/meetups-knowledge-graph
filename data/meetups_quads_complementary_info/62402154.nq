<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Anderson_(director)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Anderson (born 1954) is an Emmy award-winning and Grammy-nominated American documentary film director, producer, editor and writer whose primary subjects are rock, blues and folk musicians. Anderson often makes films about musicians he admires, such as Brian Wilson, the American singer, songwriter, and record producer who co-founded The Beach Boys. His interest in film-making began when he saw Richard Lester’s “A Hard Day's Night” at the age of 10. Some of Anderson's inspirations are the works of many filmmakers, including Michelangelo Antonioni (Blowup, 1966), Murray Lerner (Festival, 1967) and Jerry Lewis (The Disorderly Orderly, 1964). He is an alumnus of Northwestern University School of Communication, where he studied Radio/TV/Film and Music Theory & Composition." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Anderson_(director)> .

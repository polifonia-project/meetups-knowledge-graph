<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_W._S._Anderson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul William Scott Anderson (born 4 March 1965) is an English filmmaker who regularly works in science fiction films and video game adaptations. Anderson made his feature film debut with the British independent film Shopping (1994), and found commercial success with his second film, the Hollywood-produced Mortal Kombat (1995), based on the first couple of video games of the same name by Midway Games. He is best known as the creative voice behind the first six films of the Resident Evil film series (2002â€“2016), which stars Milla Jovovich (whom he married in 2009), and is based on the Capcom video game series of the same name. The series's first six films, of which Anderson directed four, have collectively grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the most commercially successful video game adaptation of all time. Other of Anderson's notable films are Event Horizon (1997), an initial critical and commercial disappointment that found renewed appreciation on home media; Alien vs. Predator (2004), based on the crossover concept of the same name between the Alien and Predator franchises; and Death Race (2008), a remake/prequel to 1975's Death Race 2000. Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt founded Impact Pictures in 1992, under which most of Anderson's films have been made." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_W._S._Anderson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada_Lee> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Canada Lee (born Leonard Lionel Cornelius Canegata; March 3, 1907 â€“ May 9, 1952) was an American professional boxer and then an actor who pioneered roles for African Americans. After careers as a jockey, boxer and musician, he became an actor in the Federal Theatre Project, including the 1936 production of Macbeth adapted and directed by Orson Welles. Lee later starred in Welles's original Broadway production of Native Son (1941). A champion of civil rights in the 1930s and 1940s, Lee was blacklisted and died shortly before he was scheduled to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He advanced the African American tradition in theatre pioneered by such actors as Paul Robeson. Lee was the father of actor Carl Lee." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada_Lee> .

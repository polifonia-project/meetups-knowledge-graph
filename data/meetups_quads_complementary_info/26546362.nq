<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Tobin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Britton Tobin (27 August 1946 â€“ 8 October 2022) was a Scottish convicted serial killer and sex offender who served a whole life order at HM Prison Edinburgh for three murders committed between 1991 and 2006. Police also investigated Tobin over the deaths and disappearances of other young women and girls. Tobin served ten years in prison for the rape, buggery and indecent assault of two girls in 1993, following which he was released in 2004. Three years after his release, he was sentenced to life with a minimum of twenty-one years for the rape and murder of Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in 2006. Remains of two teenagers who went missing in 1991 were subsequently found at his former home in Margate, Kent. Tobin was convicted of the murder of Vicky Hamilton in December 2008, resulting in his minimum sentence being increased to thirty years, and of the murder of Dinah McNicol in December 2009, resulting in a whole life order. Tobin was identified as a psychopath by a senior psychologist and it was thought he might be connected with the Bible John murders of the late 1960s, although police eventually ruled him out of the murders. Tobin reportedly claimed in prison of having murdered 48 people." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Tobin> .

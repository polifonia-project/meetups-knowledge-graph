<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maud_Cuney_Hare> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Maud Cuney Hare (née Cuney, February 16, 1874–February 13 or 14, 1936) was an American pianist, musicologist, writer, and African-American activist in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States. She was born in Galveston, the daughter of famed civil rights leader Norris Wright Cuney, who led the Texas Republican Party during and after the Reconstruction Era, and his wife Adelina (née Dowdie), a schoolteacher. In 1913 Cuney-Hare published a biography of her father. Essentially part of the second generation after emancipation, Cuney Hare studied at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and became an accomplished pianist. She lived in Jamaica Plain, a neighborhood of Boston, most of her adult life. A musicologist, she collected music from across the South and Caribbean in her study of folklore, and was the first to study Creole music. She is most remembered for her final work, Negro Musicians and Their Music (1936), which documents the development of African-American music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maud_Cuney_Hare> .

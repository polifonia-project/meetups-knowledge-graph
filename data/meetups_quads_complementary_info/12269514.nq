<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angelica_Schuyler_Church> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Angelica Church (née Schuyler /ˈskaɪlər/; February 20, 1756 – March 6, 1814) was an American socialite. She was the eldest daughter of Continental Army General Philip Schuyler, and a sister of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton and sister-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. For sixteen years, she lived in Europe with her British-born husband, John Barker Church, who became a Member of Parliament. She was a prominent member of the social elite everywhere she lived, which included Albany and New York City, as well as Paris and London. Some of her correspondence with eminent friends have been preserved, including notable exchanges with Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and the Marquis de Lafayette. The village and surrounding town of Angelica, New York were named after her." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angelica_Schuyler_Church> .

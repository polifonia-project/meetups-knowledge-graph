<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Gandy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David James Gandy (born 19 February 1980) is an English male fashion model who began his career after winning a televised model-search competition. For several years, Gandy was the lead male model for Italian designers Dolce & Gabbana who featured him in their advertising campaigns and fashion shows. In an industry dominated by skinny models, Gandy's muscular build caused some menswear fashion designers to change standards. The increase in his popularity and name recognition resulted in a broad portfolio of magazine covers, editorial photo shoots, interviews and industry awards. He has gone on to participate in fashion-related and personal projects such as writing a blog for British Vogue, writing car reviews for British GQ, mobile app development and charity work." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Gandy> .

She began wrestling at the age of 15 and was trained by The Fabulous Moolah. She was the frequent tag team partner of Sandy Parker, with whom she won the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship. The title reign, however, is unrecognized. In 1976, Green was recognized by Pro Wrestling Illustrated as the Girl Wrestler of the Year. In 1992, she joined the Professional Girl Wrestling Association, holding the promotion's championship and later acting as commissioner." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sue_Green> .

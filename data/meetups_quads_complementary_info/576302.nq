He first came to prominence as the original lead singer and harmonicist of the rock band Manfred Mann (1962â€“66) with whom he had several hit records including \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\" (UK #1, US #1) and \"Pretty Flamingo\" (UK #1). After leaving the band, Jones established a solo career and notably starred as a deified pop star in the film Privilege (1967). He presented The Blues Show on BBC Radio 2 for thirty-two years, from 1986 to 2018, and continues to perform alongside former Manfred Mann bandmates in the Blues Band and The Manfreds." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Jones_(singer)> .

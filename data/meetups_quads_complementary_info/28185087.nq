<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abraham_Quintanilla> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Abraham Isaac Quintanilla Jr. (born February 20, 1939) is an American singer, songwriter, and producer. He is the father of Tejano singer Selena and was her manager throughout her life. Quintanilla was born to a Mexican-American family in Corpus Christi, Texas. He began his music career as a member of the singing group the \"Dinos\" in 1956. He left the group in the late 1960s and initially retired from music to raise a family. After discovering Selena's singing talent, he created the band Selena y Los Dinos composed of Selena and her two older siblings to develop her talent. Under his management, the group became a major success in Tejano music by the late 1980s, allowing Selena to begin a solo career and become one of the most celebrated Latin music artists of all time. Following Selena's murder in 1995, Quintanilla became an executive producer of a biographical film about her life, in which he was portrayed by actor Edward James Olmos." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abraham_Quintanilla> .

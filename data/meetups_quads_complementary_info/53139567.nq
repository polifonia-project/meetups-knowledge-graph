Moharam Fouad was born on 24 June 1934 in Cairo, Egypt. Moharam's introduction to the screen came in 1959 with the film Hassan and Nayima, a legendary Egyptian love story with Soad Hosny. \"Moharam had a unique character, a special flavor and fought his way in the singing career without copying other celebrities singers of his time,\" said Tarek Shinawy, a renowned movie critic. Throughout his lifetime he sang well over 900 songs, 20 of which in praise of Palestine. One of his songs - called Rimsh Enoh (His Eye Lashes) - got him fans from around the world. He had some heart complications and he had to go to Europe to be treated, however complications with his kidneys caused continuous problems. He died on 27 June 2002 leaving the scene empty for the people who loved him." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muharram_Fouad> .

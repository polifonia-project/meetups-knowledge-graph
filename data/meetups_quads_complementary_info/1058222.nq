For the historical German musician, see Peter Cornelius. For the contemporary Austrian musician, see Peter Cornelius (musician). For other uses, see Cornelius.) Keigo Oyamada (小山田 圭吾, Oyamada Keigo, born January 27, 1969), also known by his moniker Cornelius (CORNELIUS（コーネリアス）, Kōneriasu), is a Japanese musician and producer who co-founded Flipper's Guitar, an influential Shibuya-kei band, and subsequently embarked on a solo career. In 1997, he released the album Fantasma, which landed him praise from American music critics, who called him a \"modern-day Brian Wilson\" or the \"Japanese Beck\". In 2007, Rolling Stone Japan named two of Oyamada's albums amongst the \"100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time\", with Fantasma ranking in 10th place and Camera Talk by Flipper's Guitar ranking in 35th place." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cornelius_(musician)> .

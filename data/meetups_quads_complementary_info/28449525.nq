He later released an album of his solo work and toured with his son's band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. His song \"Let the Day Begin\" was the official campaign song of Al Gore's 2000 U.S. presidential campaign. His song \"Oklahoma\" was one of the top ten choices for Oklahoma's official state rock song and a line from the song provided the name for Another Hot Oklahoma Night: A Rock & Roll Exhibit at the Oklahoma History Center." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Been> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russell_Watson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Russell Watson is an English tenor who has released singles and albums of both operatic-style and pop songs. He began singing as a child, and became known after performing at a working men's club. He came to attention in 1999 when he sang \"God Save the Queen\" at the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, \"Barcelona\" at the last match of the Premiership season between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, and a full set of songs at the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final in Barcelona between Manchester United and Bayern Munich. Watson's debut album The Voice was released in May 2001; four others followed. An album planned for November 2006 was delayed due to the removal of a benign pituitary tumour. This album, titled That's Life, was eventually released in March 2007. Later that year, it was discovered that there had been a regrowth of the pituitary tumour and bleeding into Watson's brain. He underwent emergency surgery and was discharged from hospital on 31 October. He underwent an extensive rehabilitation programme, including radiotherapy. His sixth studio album, Outside In, was released on 26 November 2007. Watson released La Voce, his first album since overcoming the brain tumour, in 2010. Watson has released thirteen studio albums. His latest is a collaborative album with singer Aled Jones, Christmas with Aled and Russell, which was released in November 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russell_Watson> .

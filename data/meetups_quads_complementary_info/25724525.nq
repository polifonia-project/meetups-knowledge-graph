<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Larsen_(Danish_musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jon Larsen (born 13 July 1970) is a Danish musician, best known as the drummer for Volbeat, a Danish rock band. Larsen joined Volbeat after playing drums for several other bands. The Volbeat band was established by Michael Poulsen in October 2001 and was based on his former group, Dominus. Poulsen mobilized various musicians for the group, including Thomas Bredahl, Anders Kjolholm, and Jon Larsen. Volbeat’s success grew gradually, as they gained fame internationally, mainly in Europe and America. Larsen has described the Volbeat brand of music as a fusion of genres, with a dynamic beat that fuses elements of rock and roll with heavy metal. He has also explained that the band’s choice of music is not restricted to a particular genre. In interviews, Larsen has said that their music is based on real-life experiences and is their artistic interpretation of everyday life stories." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Larsen_(Danish_musician)> .

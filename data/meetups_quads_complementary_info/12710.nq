<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Snyder> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gary Snyder (born May 8, 1930) is an American man of letters. Perhaps best known as a poet (his early work has been associated with the Beat Generation and the San Francisco Renaissance), he is also an essayist, lecturer, and environmental activist with anarchoprimitivist leanings. He has been described as the \"poet laureate of Deep Ecology\". Snyder is a winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry and the American Book Award. His work, in his various roles, reflects an immersion in both Buddhist spirituality and nature. He has translated literature into English from ancient Chinese and modern Japanese. For many years, Snyder was an academic at the University of California, Davis and for a time served as a member of the California Arts Council." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Snyder> .

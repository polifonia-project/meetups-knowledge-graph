<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiara_Lubich> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chiara Lubich (born Silvia Lubich; January 22, 1920, Trento â€“ March 14, 2008, Rocca di Papa), was an Italian teacher and author who founded the Focolare Movement, which aims to bring unity among people and promote universal family. She was a charismatic figure who broke with many female stereotypes as early as the 1940s, opening a previously unheard of role for women in society and the Roman Catholic Church. Lubich is considered a notable figure in ecumenical, interreligious and intercultural dialogue, as recognized by UNESCO, which awarded her the Prize for Peace Education in 1996; and the Council of Europe, with the Human Rights Award in 1998; among others. She took her place in the history of contemporary spirituality among teachers and mystics for the authentic Gospel-based inspiration, universal outlook, and cultural and social influence that distinguish her charism, spirituality, and work." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiara_Lubich> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Siegel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jules Siegel (October 21, 1935 â€“ November 17, 2012) was a novelist, journalist, and graphic designer who is best known as one of the earliest writers to treat rock music as a serious art, although his writings about rock constituted only a small part of his total output. His work appeared over the years in Playboy, Best American Short Stories, Library of America's Writing Los Angeles, and many other publications. He occasionally contributed book reviews to the San Francisco Chronicle, and he administered newsroom-l, an email discussion list for journalists. His articles about Brian Wilson, Bob Dylan, Thomas Pynchon and other prominent Americans were primary (and often unique) sources of information based on his personal acquaintance and extensive direct interviews with the subjects. \"Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!\" has been anthologized several times and is used as a primary source in every book about Brian Wilson's struggle to complete Smile, his \"teenage symphony to God.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Siegel> .

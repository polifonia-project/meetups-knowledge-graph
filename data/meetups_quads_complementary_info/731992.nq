He was best known for his work with Bun B as one half of the hip-hop duo Underground Kingz (UGK). Signing to Jive Records in 1992, UGK released their major-label debut album Too Hard to Swallow to critical acclaim. The group followed this with their second and third major-label albums Super Tight in 1994 and Ridin' Dirty in 1996, both of which charted in the Billboard 200 to further success. The group received national attention in 2000 after being featured on Jay-Z's hit single \"Big Pimpin'\", which peaked at #18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Rhythmic Top 40. The group went on hiatus for the first half of the 2000s after Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison for a probation violation. During this time both members pursued solo careers, with Pimp C releasing his solo debut, The Sweet James Jones Stories, in 2005, composed of material recorded prior to his sentencing. After being released from prison in December 2005, he released his second solo album, Pimpalation, in 2006. UGK released their eponymous fifth studio album in 2007, which spawned the hit single \"International Players Anthem (I Choose You)\" featuring OutKast, which peaked at #70 on the Billboard Hot 100. Pimp C was found dead in his hotel room on December 4, 2007, with a coroner's report allegedly attributing his death to complications stemming from heavy consumption of purple drank and his pre-existing condition of sleep apnea." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pimp_C> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Grant> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hugh John Mungo Grant (born 9 September 1960) is an English actor. He established himself early in his career as both a charming, and vulnerable romantic lead and has since transitioned into a dramatic character actor. Among his numerous accolades, he's received a British Academy Film Award, a Golden Globe Award, Volpi Cup, and an Honorary César. As of 2018, his films had grossed a total of nearly US$3 billion worldwide. In 2022 Time Out magazine listed Grant as one of Britain's Greatest Actors of all time. Grant first received attention for his early roles in acclaimed costume dramas such as Merchant-Ivory's Maurice (1987), for which he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, and The Remains of the Day (1993), as well as Sense and Sensibility (1995) and Restoration (1995). Grant then reached global stardom as a leading man in Richard Curtis's romantic comedy film Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), whereupon he received the Golden Globe Award and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. He starred in the romantic comedies Notting Hill (1999), Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), Two Weeks Notice (2002), Love Actually (2003), and Music and Lyrics (2007). Grant began to take against-type parts, starting with multiple roles in The Wachowskis' epic science fiction film Cloud Atlas (2012). He then received critical acclaim for his roles in both Florence Foster Jenkins (2016), and Paddington 2 (2017) for which he received a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor nominations for each. He then starred in the television projects, the BBC miniseries A Very English Scandal (2018), and HBO miniseries The Undoing (2020) earning Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nominations for both as well. During this time he has starred in the action films The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) and The Gentlemen (2019). Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of sarcasm and characteristic physical mannerisms. He has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and his hostility towards the media. He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Grant> .

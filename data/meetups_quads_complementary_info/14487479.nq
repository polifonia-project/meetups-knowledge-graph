He served as publicity director of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1946 to 1963. In 1947, he published the first NHL press and radio guide, and co-founded The Hockey News with Will Cote and C$383.81. McKenzie bought out his partner and later sold an 80 per cent share of The Hockey News for a reported $4-million in 1973. He stayed on as its publisher and a columnist until 1981. He also published Canadian Football News, Ontario Golf News, and the magazines Hockey Pictorial and Hockey World. McKenzie is the namesake of three separate ice hockey awards; the Ken McKenzie Trophy of the Central Hockey League, the Ken McKenzie Trophy of the International Hockey League, and the Ken McKenzie Award of the American Hockey League. He received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997, for recognition of his contributions to journalism in ice hockey. He was inducted into both the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame and the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame in 1999." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_McKenzie> .

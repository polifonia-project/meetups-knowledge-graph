<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeffrey_Clark> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeffrey Bossert Clark (born April 17, 1967) is an American lawyer who was Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division from 2018 to 2021. In September 2020, he was also appointed acting head of the Civil Division. In 2020 and 2021, Clark helped then-president Donald Trump attempt to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Clark's actions in that endeavor were reviewed by the District of Columbia Bar Association – the entity authorized by law to pursue attorney discipline and disbarment in the District of Columbia – which recommended discipline to the DC Court of Appeals in July 2022. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump refused to concede while making false claims of fraud, Clark worked on ways to cast doubt on the election results. Trump considered installing Clark as head of the Department of Justice when acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen refused to lend credence to Trump's false claims of fraud, but backed off when faced with the prospect of mass resignations within the Department of Justice if he made the change. Clark resigned from the Department of Justice on January 14, 2021, after controversy over his post-election actions. After the end of the Trump administration, Clark was briefly named the Chief of Litigation and Director of Strategy at the conservative-libertarian New Civil Liberties Alliance. On December 1, 2021, the House committee on the January 6 attack voted to recommend contempt of Congress charges against Clark after he refused to comply with a subpoena. As of June 2022 Clark worked as a Senior Fellow and Director of Litigation at the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank founded by his friend Russell Vought, former director of the Office of Management and Budget." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeffrey_Clark> .

Baekhyun began training under SM Entertainment in 2011. A few months later, he made his debut in 2012 as a member of the South Korean-Chinese boy group Exo, its sub-group Exo-K and later on its sub-unit Exo-CBX. He is also the leader of South Korean supergroup SuperM. Following the release of several albums and extended plays with Exo, Baekhyun began pursuing a solo career in 2019 by releasing his debut extended play, City Lights, which sold more than half-a-million copies in 2019 and is the best-selling album by a solo artist of the 2010s in South Korea. City Lights was followed by two million-selling EPs, Delight (2020), the first album by a solo artist in South Korea to have sold over 1 million copies in 19 years, and Bambi (2021). He has been labeled as the \"Genius Idol\", and won three consecutive Mnet Asian Music Awards for Best Male Artist from 2019 to 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baekhyun> .

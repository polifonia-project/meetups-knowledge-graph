<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brenda_Holloway> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brenda Holloway (born June 26, 1946) is an American singer and songwriter, who was a recording artist for Motown Records during the 1960s. Her best-known recordings are the soul hits, \"Every Little Bit Hurts\", \"When I'm Gone\", and \"You've Made Me So Very Happy.\" The latter, which she co-wrote, was later widely popularized when it became a Top Ten hit for Blood, Sweat & Tears. She left Motown after four years, at the age of 22, and largely retired from the music industry until the 1990s, after her recordings had become popular on the British \"Northern soul\" scene." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brenda_Holloway> .

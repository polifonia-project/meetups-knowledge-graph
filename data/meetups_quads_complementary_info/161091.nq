<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rodney_Dangerfield> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rodney Dangerfield (born Jacob Rodney Cohen; November 22, 1921 â€“ October 5, 2004) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, screenwriter, and producer. He was known for his self-deprecating one-liner humor, his catchphrase \"I don't get no respect!\" and his monologues on that theme. He began his career working as a stand-up comic at the Fantasy Lounge in New York City. His act grew in popularity as he became a mainstay on late-night talk shows throughout the 1960s and 1970s, eventually developing into a headlining act on the Las Vegas casino circuit. His catchphrase \"I don't get no respect!\" came from an attempt to improve one of his stand-up jokes. \"I played hide and seek; they wouldn't even look for me.\" He thought the joke would be stronger if it used the format: \"I was so ...\" beginning (\"I was so poor,\" \"He was so ugly,\" \"She was so stupid,\" etc.). He tried \"I get no respect,\" and got a much better response from the audience; it became a permanent feature of his act and comedic persona. He appeared in a few bit parts in films, such as The Projectionist, throughout the 1970s, but his breakout film role came in 1980 as a boorish nouveau riche golfer in the ensemble comedy Caddyshack, which was followed by two additional successful films in which he starred: 1983's Easy Money and 1986's Back to School. Additional film work kept him busy through the rest of his life, mostly in comedies, but with a rare dramatic role in 1994's Natural Born Killers as an abusive father. Health troubles curtailed his output through the early 2000s before his death in 2004, following a month in a coma due to complications from heart valve surgery." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rodney_Dangerfield> .

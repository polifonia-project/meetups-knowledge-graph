He was known for his patriotic Nepali songs. His voice range allowed him to sing songs of every genre of Nepalese music. He belongs to the first generation of Nepali singers who became professional singers. His songs have also been used in several movies and dramas across the country. Gopal dedicated his entire life to creating music. He spent years researching and studying Nepali folk and traditional as well as Indian, in particular Rabindra Sangeet and Newari classical music. His compositions reflect this deep innate bond that he believed would touch a common cord around the world transcending man made barriers and boundaries. His compositions are not confined to any form or type. Gopal started his musical career as a flautist. He wrote his first lyrics in 1963 and his first musical composition was recorded in 1964. His musical works encompass nationalistic/patriotic, spiritual, romantic, philosophical, dancing tunes, ballads, musical compositions, ode to women and womanhood, songs for children and youth and thematic songs on environment, sports, scouts, etc. The list is endless. His renderings range from purely classical to folk, modern and music specially created for women and children. In all this variety he maintains his sensitivity and finesse in captivating and maintaining the Nepali touch." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gopal_Yonzon> .

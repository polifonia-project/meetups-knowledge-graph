He wrote, composed, and recorded the song \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" in 1979, which was covered in 1983 by Cyndi Lauper, who turned it into a best-selling hit. He also composed the new-wave and MTV songs \"Escalator of Life\" and \"Change Reaction\", which he performed with his band, Robert Hazard and the Heroes, that was popular in the Philadelphia club scene during the 1980s. These songs appeared on the five song EP Robert Hazard, released in June 1982 by his own record label \"RHA Records\", and the next November by major label RCA Records. RCA released his first LP album, Wing of Fire, in January 1984." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Hazard> .

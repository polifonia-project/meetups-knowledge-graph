<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zelda_Fitzgerald> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Zelda Fitzgerald (née Sayre; July 24, 1900 – March 10, 1948) was an American novelist, painter, dancer, and socialite. Born in Montgomery, Alabama, she was noted for her beauty and high spirits, and was dubbed by her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald as \"the first American flapper\". She and Scott became emblems of the Jazz Age, for which they are still celebrated. The immediate success of Scott's first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920), brought them into contact with high society, but their marriage was plagued by wild drinking, infidelity and bitter recriminations. Ernest Hemingway, whom Zelda Fitzgerald disliked, blamed her for her husband's declining literary output. Zelda suffered from mental health crisis and was increasingly confined to specialist clinics. Different accounts suggest that she suffered from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or alternatively that she was victim of manipulation by her husband. The couple were living apart when Scott died suddenly in 1940. Zelda Fitzgerald died over seven years later in a fire at the hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, in which she was a patient. A 1970 biography by Nancy Milford was on the short list of contenders for the Pulitzer Prize. In 1992, Fitzgerald was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zelda_Fitzgerald> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amparito_Farrar> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Amparito Farrar (May 18, 1893 â€” October 31, 1989) was an American soprano concert singer who came to prominence after performing in France for the troops during World War I. A native of Portland, Oregon, Farrar was the daughter of Spanish-American parents. She was raised in Portland and Sacramento, California, and began singing at a young age, accompanied by her musician mother. As an adolescent, Farrar traveled to Europe, where she studied music in Vienna, Paris, London, and Milan. While in Europe, she performed with the Vienna Opera, and appeared in a West End performance of Adele in 1914. Farrar pursued a musical career in New York City, signing a recording contract with Columbia Records, before sailing to France with her mother in the summer of 1918 to entertain troops fighting in World War I. Upon returning to the United States following a five-month stint, Farrar married Goodrich Truman Smith, a soldier she had met while abroad, in Manhattan. She lived the remainder of her life there and in Florida, where she died in 1989, aged 96." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amparito_Farrar> .

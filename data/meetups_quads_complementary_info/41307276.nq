Born and raised in Cheltenham, she became a backup dancer for numerous famous musicians after moving to London at the age of 17, and made her own musical debut with EP1 (2012). Barnett's debut studio album, LP1 (2014), reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart and number 30 on the US Billboard 200. It was also nominated for that year's Mercury Prize. She then released the EP M3LL155X (2015) and took a four-year hiatus, after which she released her second studio album, Magdalene (2019). After signing with Atlantic Records, she released the mixtape Caprisongs (2022). Her work has consistently garnered acclaim and has been described as \"genre-bending\", drawing on various genres including electronic music, trip hop, R&B, and avant-garde." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/FKA_Twigs> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Patton_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Patton (July 12, 1935 â€“ March 19, 2002) was an American jazz, blues and R&B pianist and organist often known by his nickname, Big John Patton. Patton was one of the most in-demand organists during the golden era of the Hammond B-3 organs between 1963 and 1970. He recorded extensively for Blue Note and performed or collaborated with Lloyd Price, Grant Green, and Lou Donaldson. Patton had a lower profile in the 1970s but enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s and 1990s, often in collaboration with saxophonist John Zorn. His later music incorporated modal and free jazz." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Patton_(musician)> .

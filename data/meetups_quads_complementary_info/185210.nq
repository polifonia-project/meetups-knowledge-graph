<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ralph_McTell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ralph McTell (born Ralph May, 3 December 1944) is an English singer-songwriter and acoustic guitar player who has been an influential figure on the UK folk music scene since the 1960s. McTell is best known for his song \"Streets of London\" (1969), which has been covered by over two hundred artists around the world. McTell modelled his guitar style on American country blues guitar players of the early 20th century, including Blind Blake, Robert Johnson and Blind Willie McTell. These influences led a friend to suggest his professional surname. An accomplished performer on piano and harmonica as well as guitar, McTell issued his first album in 1968 and found acclaim on the folk circuit. He reached his greatest commercial success in 1974 when a new recording of \"Streets of London\" became a No. 2 hit on the UK Singles Chart. Other notable compositions include \"From Clare to Here\", a ballad about Irish emigration. In the 1980s, he wrote and played songs for two TV children's programmes, Alphabet Zoo, which also featured Nerys Hughes, followed by Tickle on the Tum, featuring Jaqui Reddin. He also recorded Keith Hopwood's and Malcolm Rowe's theme song to Cosgrove Hall's adaptation of The Wind in the Willows." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ralph_McTell> .

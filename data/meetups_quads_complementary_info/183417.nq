<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Frusciante> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Anthony Frusciante (/fruːˈʃɑːnteɪ/; born March 5, 1970) is an American musician, best known as the guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers across three stints since 1988. He has released 11 solo albums and 7 EPs, ranging in style from acoustic guitar to electronic music. Frusciante joined the Chili Peppers at the age of 18 after the death of guitarist Hillel Slovak, and first appeared on their album Mother's Milk (1989). His second album with the band, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was their breakthrough success. Overwhelmed by the band's newfound popularity, he quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered a period of heroin addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997). In 1998, he completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Chili Peppers, taking them to major success with their albums Californication (1999), By the Way (2002), and Stadium Arcadium (2006). Frusciante's solo work encompasses genres including experimental rock, ambient music, and electronica. He released six albums in 2004, each exploring different genres and recording techniques. In 2009, Frusciante released The Empyrean, which features Chili Peppers bassist Flea and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer and again parted ways with the Chilli Peppers before rejoining them in 2019. Frusciante also releases acid house under the alias Trickfinger. With Klinghoffer and Joe Lally, he has released two albums as Ataxia. Frusciante ranked number eighteen on Rolling Stone's 2003 list of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2012." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Frusciante> .

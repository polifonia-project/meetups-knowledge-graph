<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muhammad_Subuh_Sumohadiwidjojo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (born June 22, 1901, in Kedungjati, near Semarang, Java, Indonesia; died June 23, 1987) was an Indonesian who founded the movement known as Subud.As a young man Muhammad Subuh claims to have received a series of intense experiences that he believed gave him contact with a spiritual energy from a higher power. By the 1930s, he believed that it was his task to transmit this energy - which he called latihan kejiwaan (Indonesian for \"spiritual exercise\") - to others, but that he was not to seek people out but simply to wait for those who asked for it. In 1956, Pak Subuh, or \"Bapak\" as he was called by members of Subud (the word \"Bapak\" is Indonesian for something akin to father), was invited to England by J. G. Bennett, where many Westerners joined Subud. He was then asked to go to other countries such as the United States and Australia. In this way, Subud spread rapidly around the world. When he died in 1987 he left many talks on tape, video and in print, which Subud uses to guide the organization he founded." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muhammad_Subuh_Sumohadiwidjojo> .

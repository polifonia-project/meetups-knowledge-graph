His career has a track record of 74 platinum and 108 gold records and 14 No. 1 hits. He's worked with artists like Lady Gaga, Chris Brown, Tokio Hotel, Limp Bizkit, Selena Gomez, Nelly Furtado, Keri Hilson, Aura Dione, and Adam Lambert. For his work as a songwriter, Jost was named Germany's best songwriter (Rock & Pop) by the GEMA (the German equivalent to the ASCAP/BMI). For Tokio Hotel, Jost has composed, produced and mixed six No. 1 singles and three No. 1 albums. Even though Jost managed several careers of big media artists, he rarely answers interviews for the press and is known for principally never giving TV interviews. Jost is working in Los Angeles as of 2012." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Jost> .

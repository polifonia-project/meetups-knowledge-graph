<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenny_Morris_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kenny Morris (born Kenneth Ian Morris; 1 February 1957) is an English drummer, songwriter and visual artist. He was the first studio drummer of Siouxsie and the Banshees. He joined the band in January 1977; he had attended their first live appearance at the 100 Club a few months earlier and had been impressed by their performance. Morris's first studio recording with the group was in November 1977 when they recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio. Music journalist Kris Needs said : \"Like as a rhythm machine for feet and guts Kenny Morris' drumming is unorthodox, primitive (in a tribal sense) and far removed from the clicking hi-hats of the fly-strength paradiddle merchants\". He played mostly toms. He has been cited as a major influence by several drummers of the post-punk era including Stephen Morris of Joy Division, Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus, and Paul Ferguson of Killing Joke. During the recording of the band's debut single \"Hong Kong Garden\", producer Steve Lillywhite suggested to him to record the drums separately. Morris did the bass drum and the snare drum first. He did the cymbals and the tom-toms later. Lillywhite also added echo on the drums, adding significant space to the entire recording. NME wrote that Lillywhite's work with Morris \"revolutionis[ed] the post-punk band's sound with an innovative approach to laying down the drums\". Morris played on the albums The Scream in 1978 and Join Hands. He left the band a few hours before a concert in Aberdeen at the beginning of the Join Hands tour, on 7 September 1979." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenny_Morris_(musician)> .

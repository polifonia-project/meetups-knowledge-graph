Whilst in Mis-Teeq, the singer notched up seven UK top 10 hits and two top 10, double platinum albums. As part of Mis-Teeq, Sabrina has sold over 12 million records worldwide. In the US, the group had had two top 5 hits on the US Billboard Dance Charts with \"One Night Stand\" peaking at No. 4 and \"Scandalous\" peaking at No. 2. Their eponymous album also reached No. 4 on the US Heatseekers charts and won the Soul Train Lady of Soul Award for Best R&B/Soul Album. Following the group disbanding, Sabrina became a television personality, becoming the winner of Celebrity Scissorhands in 2008 and appeared as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2009, where she was one of the last women standing, finishing sixth. In April 2010, Washington released her debut solo single \"OMG (Oh My Gosh)\", which topped the charts throughout Europe and spent three weeks at No. 1 in Poland.

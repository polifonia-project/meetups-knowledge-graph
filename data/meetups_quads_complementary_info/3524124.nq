<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shahram_Nazeri> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shahram Nazeri (Kurdish: شارام نازری, romanized: Şaram Nazirî, Persian: شهرام ناظری; born 18 February 1950) is a contemporary Iranian tenor of Kurdish origin from Kermanshah, Iran, who sings Sufi music, classical and traditional Kurdish and Persian music. He has been accompanied by some of the masters of Iranian traditional music such as Jalil Shahnaz, Hossein Alizadeh, Jalal Zolfonoun, Parviz Meshkatian and Faramarz Payvar. He has also worked with his son Hafez, a composer. Nazeri was the first musician to include Rumi's poetry within Persian music, thus establishing a tradition of Sufi music within both Persian classical music and Kurdish music. The Christian Science Monitor has called him \"Iran's Pavarotti\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shahram_Nazeri> .

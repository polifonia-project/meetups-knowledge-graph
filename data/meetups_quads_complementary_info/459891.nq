<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reggie_Miller> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Reginald Wayne Miller (born August 24, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player who played his entire 18-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career with the Indiana Pacers. Miller was known for his precision three-point shooting, especially in pressure situations and most notably against the New York Knicks, for which he earned the nickname \"Knick Killer.\" When he retired, he held the record for most career 3-point field goals made. He is currently fourth on the list behind Stephen Curry, Ray Allen, and James Harden. A five-time All-Star selection, Miller led the league in free throw percentage five times and won a gold medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Miller is widely regarded as the Pacers' greatest player of all time. His No. 31 was retired by the team in 2006. Currently, he works as an NBA commentator for TNT and college basketball analyst for CBS Sports. Miller was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reggie_Miller> .

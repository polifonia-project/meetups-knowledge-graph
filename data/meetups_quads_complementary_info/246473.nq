<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_&_Wine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Samuel \"Sam\" Ervin Beam (born July 26, 1974), better known by his stage name Iron & Wine, is an American singer-songwriter. He has released six studio albums, several EPs and singles, as well as a few download-only releases, which include a live album (a recording of his 2005 Bonnaroo performance). He occasionally tours with a full band. Beam was raised in South Carolina before moving to Virginia and then Florida to attend school. He now resides in Durham, North Carolina. The name Iron & Wine is taken from a dietary supplement named \"Beef, Iron & Wine\" that he found in a general store while shooting a film." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iron_&_Wine> .

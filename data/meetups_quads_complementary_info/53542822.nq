<http://dbpedia.org/resource/DJ_Jimmy_Jatt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Oluwaforijimi \"Jimmy\" Adewale Amu (born October 15, 1966), professionally referred to by his stage name DJ Jimmy Jatt, is a Nigerian disc jockey who is revered as one of the pioneering hip hop DJs in Nigeria. He started out his music career as a rapper under the sobriquet Master J but delved into DJing after his failure in getting signed by a record label despite releasing a handful of songs including a demo recording. He is best known for his Jimmy's Jump Off concert, an event he started in 2008 to become one of the most attended entertainment events in Nigeria. In 2006, he won the Hip Hop World Hall of Fame award at the maiden edition of The Headies for his contribution to hip-hop in Nigeria." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/DJ_Jimmy_Jatt> .

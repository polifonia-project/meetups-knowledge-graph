<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feodor_I_of_Russia> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Fyodor I Ivanovich (Russian: Фёдор I Иванович) or Feodor I Ioannovich (Russian: Феодор I Иоаннович; 31 May 1557 – 17 January (NS) 1598), also known as Feodor the Bellringer (Russian: Феодор Звонарь), reigned as Tsar of Russia from 1584 until his death in 1598. Feodor's mother died when he was three, and he grew up in the shadow of his father, Ivan the Terrible. A pious man of retiring disposition, Feodor took little interest in politics, and the country was effectively administered in his name by Boris Godunov, the brother of his beloved wife Irina. His childless death marked the end of the Rurik dynasty, and spurred Russia's descent into the catastrophic Time of Troubles. In Russian documents, Feodor is sometimes called blessed (Russian: Блаженный). He is also listed in the \"Great Synaxaristes\" of the Orthodox Church, with his feast day on January 7 (OS)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Feodor_I_of_Russia> .

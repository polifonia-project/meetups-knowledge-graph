She was a recording artist in the early 1930s, releasing eight sides, including the dirty blues tracks \"You've Got to Save That Thing\" and \"I Crave Your Lovin' Every Day\". Her recordings were in a primitive barrelhouse style. Little is known of her life outside of music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ora_Alexander> .

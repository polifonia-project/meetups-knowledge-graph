<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Adams_(actor,_born_1931)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nick Adams (born Nicholas Aloysius Adamshock; July 10, 1931 – February 7, 1968) was an American film and television actor and screenwriter. He was noted for his roles in several Hollywood films during the 1950s and 1960s along with his starring role in the ABC television series The Rebel (1959–1961). Decades after his death from a prescription drug overdose at the age of 36, his widely publicized friendships with James Dean and Elvis Presley would stir speculation about both his private life and the circumstances of his death. In an AllMovie synopsis for Adams's last film, reviewer Dan Pavlides wrote, \"Plagued by personal excesses, he will be remembered just as much for what he could have done in cinema as what he left behind.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Adams_(actor,_born_1931)> .

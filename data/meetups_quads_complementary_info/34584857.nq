A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the 75th governor of Rhode Island from 2015 to 2021, and is the first woman to serve in the role. Born and raised in Rhode Island, Raimondo began her career in venture capital following law school. In 2000, Raimondo co-founded Point Judith Capital, Rhode Island's first venture capital firm. She entered politics in 2010, when she successfully ran for the position of general treasurer of Rhode Island. During her first year in office, Raimondo prioritized reforming Rhode Island's public employee pension system. In 2014, Raimondo was elected Governor in a three-way contest with 41% of the vote. While in office, Raimondo was elected to serve as vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2018 election cycle. Reelected in 2018, Raimondo was tasked with overseeing the state's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2020 presidential election, Raimondo served as co-chair of Michael Bloomberg's 2020 presidential campaign. Described as a \"moderate technocrat\" by The Washington Post, Raimondo is often characterized as a centrist within her party. Chosen to serve as Secretary of Commerce by President Joe Biden, Raimondo played a leading role in negotiations for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gina_Raimondo> .

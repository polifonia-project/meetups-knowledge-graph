Hernandez's biggest influence and idol is the late Chalino Sanchez, but he also feels admiration for many artists and his musical influences have a big range. He is a distant cousin of fellow Regional Mexican artist, El Potro de Sinaloa. Hernández lived in Los Angeles until he was four when his family moved to Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico. He spent most of his adolescence there before starting his musical career. He currently lives in West Covina, California." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Larry_Hernández> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Brown_(blues_musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roy James Brown (September 10, 1920 or 1925 â€“ May 25, 1981) was an American blues singer who had a significant influence on the early development of rock and roll and the direction of R&B. His original song and hit recording \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" has been covered by many artists including Wynonie Harris, Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, Joe Ely, Ricky Nelson, Jerry Lee Lewis, Pat Boone, James Brown, the Doors, and the rock group Montrose. Brown was one of the first popular R&B singers to perform songs with a gospel-steeped delivery, which was then considered taboo by many churches. In addition, his melismatic, pleading vocal style influenced notable artists such as B.B. King, Bobby Bland, Elvis Presley, Jackie Wilson, James Brown and Little Richard." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Brown_(blues_musician)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Hunt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jerry Edward Hunt (November 30, 1943 â€“ November 27, 1993) was an American composer who created works using live electronics partly controlled by his ritualistic performance techniques which were influenced by his interest in the occult. He was considered a pioneer of live, electronic and computer-aided audio and video. Hunt lived his entire life in Texas, living in a house he built himself on his family's ranchland. For Hunt, it was financially necessary to live in Texas, but almost impossible to create a career within the state. Hunt was often described as \"hyperactive\" and always on the move. He was also often either chewing on tobacco or chewing gum. He often dressed conservatively, in a suit or button-up shirt and tie. He was said to have a \"wicked sense of humor.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Hunt> .

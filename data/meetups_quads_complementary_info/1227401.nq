<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darwood_Kaye> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Darwood Kenneth Smith (September 8, 1929 â€“ May 15, 2002), also known as Darwood Kaye, was an American child actor most notable for his semi-regular role as the bookish rich kid Waldo in the Our Gang short subjects series from 1937 to 1940. As an adult, Smith became a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, ministering at several churches until his death in 2002. Kaye was \"discovered\" in 1935 while his family was on vacation in Hollywood, California; he was asked to come to the studios for a screen test, and made some uncredited appearances in films in 1936." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darwood_Kaye> .

She recorded the songs \"For Sentimental Reasons\", \"It's So Peaceful in the Country\", \"Doin' The Uptown Lowdown\", \"Trust in Me\", \"Where Are You?\", \"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\", \"Small Fry\", \"Please Be Kind\", \"Darn That Dream\", \"Rockin' Chair\", \"Blame It on My Last Affair\", and \"Says My Heart\". She had three records that reached number one on the popular charts. She grew up on the Coeur d'Alene Reservation in Idaho, where her mother was an enrolled member. The family moved to Spokane, Washington when she was 13. Her younger brothers also became musicians. Her brother, Al Rinker, started to perform as a singer with Bing Crosby in Spokane and became a member of The Rhythm Boys. As adults, Charles Rinker was a lyricist, and Miles Rinker was a clarinet and saxophone player who later became a booking agent." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mildred_Bailey> .

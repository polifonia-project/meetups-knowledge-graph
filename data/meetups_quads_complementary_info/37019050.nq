<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rina_Ikoma> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rina Ikoma (生駒 里奈, Ikoma Rina, born December 29, 1995 in Yurihonjō, Akita Prefecture) is an actress and former Japanese idol best recognized as the \"Face of Nogizaka46\". She was a first generation member of the girl group Nogizaka46 and AKB48's Team B, also known as the former's eternal ace and original center, being appointed the position for an A-side six times in total for Nogizaka46's first five singles, \"Guruguru Curtain\", \"Oide Shampoo\", \"Hashire! Bicycle\", \"Seifuku no Mannequin\", and \"Kimi no Na wa Kibō\", as well as their 12th Single \"Taiyō Nokku\", which was the record highest at the time for the group, and is still the most for solo centers. Yasushi Akimoto originally made it to be so that Ikoma's graduation single \"Synchronicity (song)\" was for her as center, but she declined. She played the leading role of Naomi Nakashima in the film Corpse Party." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rina_Ikoma> .

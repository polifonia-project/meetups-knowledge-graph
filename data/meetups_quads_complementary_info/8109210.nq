<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_James_Burgess> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard James Burgess MBE (born 29 June 1949) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, composer, author, manager, marketer and inventor. Burgess's music career spans more than 50 years. He came to prominence in the early 1980s as co-founder and co-lead singer of the synthpop band Landscape, which released a top-5 hit in 1981 with the single \"Einstein a Go-Go\". Burgess is one of the main composers of Landscape's music, and made major musical and lyrical contributions to the band's songs. After the band's break-up, he pursued a brief, moderately successful solo career releasing one mini-album, Richard James Burgess in 1984. He launched his career as a producer with Spandau Ballet's debut UK hit \"To Cut a Long Story Short\", the first commercial success for the hitherto underground New Romantic movement. Burgess currently serves as the President and CEO of A2IM: American Association of Independent Music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_James_Burgess> .

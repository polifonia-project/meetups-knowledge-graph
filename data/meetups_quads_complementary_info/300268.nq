<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Mansell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clinton Darryl Mansell (/ˈmænsəl/; born 7 January 1963) is an English musician, singer, and composer, born in Coventry. He served as the lead singer and multi-instrumentalist of alt-rock band Pop Will Eat Itself before embarking on a career as a film score composer. Mansell moved to the United States after the dissolution of the group and started working with filmmaker Darren Aronofsky. He has subsequently become an award-winning, Golden Globe and Grammy-nominated film composer, collaborating extensively with Aronofsky and writing scores for dozens of other films (both shorts and features), TV series, and video games. Mansell resides in Los Angeles, composing and occasionally touring live versions of his work. A pioneer of sampling in his own work, Mansell's work is now a favourite with sampling musicians." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clint_Mansell> .

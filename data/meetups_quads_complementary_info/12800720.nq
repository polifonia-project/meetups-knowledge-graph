Brooke played 132 games for the Sun, where she's remembered for the clutch three-pointer she hit in the final seconds of Game 2 of the 2005 WNBA Finals against the Sacramento Monarchs at Mohegan Sun Arena. That shot sent the game to overtime. She played for Estudiantes in Spain during the 2008–09 WNBA off-season. She tore her ACL and decided to retire following the 2009 season.

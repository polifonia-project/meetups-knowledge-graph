She is the designer of a fashion line called \"The Line by K\" and maintains her site, \"Karla's Closet\". Karla photographs her looks on her site and often mixes vintage pieces, from labels like Versace, with modern companies. She has referred to her style as a \"pot of stew\" which includes \"simplicity,\" \"androgyny\" and \"femininity.\" Karla was also briefly in an American girl group called the Slumber Party Girls, the house band for the TV show Dance Revolution; they also had a mini-show called KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS. Deras, along with other bloggers, designed a bag for Coach." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karla_Deras> .

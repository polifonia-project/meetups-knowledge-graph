<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guilhermina_Suggia> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Guilhermina Augusta Xavier de Medim Suggia Carteado Mena, known as Guilhermina Suggia, (27 June 1885 – 30 July 1950) was a Portuguese cellist. She studied in Paris, France with Pablo Casals, and built an international reputation. She spent many years living in the United Kingdom, where she was particularly celebrated. She retired in 1939, but emerged from retirement to give concerts in Britain. Her last was in 1949, the year before her death. Suggia bequeathed an important British scholarship for young cellists, which has been granted to performers including Derek Simpson, who was first holder of the Suggia Scholarship and continued his studies in Paris under Pierre Fournier, Rohan de Saram, Jacqueline du Pré, Robert Cohen and Steven Isserlis." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guilhermina_Suggia> .

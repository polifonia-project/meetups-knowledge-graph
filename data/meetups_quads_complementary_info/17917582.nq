<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pervis_Jackson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pervis Jackson (May 17, 1938 â€“ August 18, 2008) was an American R&B singer, noted as the bass singer for The Spinners, and was one of the group's original members as well as their spokesman. His deep timbered voice and calm swagger garnered him a reputation around town and the industry. Jackson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, but moved with his family at a very young age to the city of Detroit. Jackson was perhaps best known for his line of \"12:45\" from the group's Billboard charting Top 10 hit \"Games People Play\", released in 1975. Jackson was still a part of The Spinners up to his death from brain and liver cancer at the age of 70, in Detroit, Michigan, on August 18, 2008." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pervis_Jackson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neil_Tennant> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Neil Francis Tennant (born 10 July 1954) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and music journalist, and co-founder of the synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, which he formed with Chris Lowe in 1981. He was a journalist for Smash Hits, and assistant editor for the magazine in the mid-1980s. Tennant coined the phrase imperial phase to describe the period in which a musical artist is regarded to be at their commercial and creative peak simultaneously. This observation was initially self-referential, made as the Pet Shop Boys had achieved commercial success with four British number one hits (\"It's a Sin\", \"What Have I Done to Deserve This\", \"Heart\", and \"Always on My Mind\"), had received unanimous critical praise for their first three albums, and had expanded their creative horizons through innovative collaborations in the visual and performing arts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neil_Tennant> .

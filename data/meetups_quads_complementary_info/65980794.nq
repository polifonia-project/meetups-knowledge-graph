<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herb_Remington> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Herbert Leroy Remington (1926â€“2018) was an American lap steel guitarist who played Western swing music with Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys from 1946 to 1949. A member of the International Steel Guitar Hall of Fame (1979), Remington is known for his Hawaiian style playing combined with swing-based jazz soloing. One of his signature recordings was Bob Wills' \"Boot Heel Drag\", which appeared on the B-side of Wills' classic hit, \"Faded Love\". He is also known for \"Remington's Ride\", a song that became a standard for steel players. Indiana-born Remington studied Hawaiian steel guitar as a youth, but serendipitously got into Western swing music in his teens and became one of the genres most renowned steel guitarists." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herb_Remington> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brad_Henry> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Bradford Henry (born July 10, 1963) is an American lawyer and politician who was the 26th governor of Oklahoma from 2003 to 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected governor in 2002. Henry won re-election for a second term on November 7, 2006 with 67% of the vote. Henry was the third governor and second Democrat in Oklahoma history to serve two consecutive terms, along with Democrat George Nigh and Republican Frank Keating. In 2010, Henry was ineligible to run for re-election even though he maintained high approval ratings, because of term limits set by the Oklahoma Constitution. His second term ended on January 10, 2011, and he was succeeded as governor by Republican Mary Fallin. As of 2022, he is the last Democrat to serve as Governor of Oklahoma. Henry had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate, but declined to run in the 2014 special election to replace Tom Coburn." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brad_Henry> .

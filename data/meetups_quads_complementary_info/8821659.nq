<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burial_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Emmanuel Bevan, known by his recording alias Burial, is a British electronic musician from South London. Initially remaining anonymous, Burial became the first artist signed to Kode9's electronic label Hyperdub in 2005. He won acclaim the following year for his self-titled debut album, an influential release in the UK's dubstep scene which showcased a dark, emotive take on UK rave music styles such as UK garage and 2-step; it was named the album of the year by The Wire. Burial's second album, Untrue, was released to further critical acclaim in 2007. In 2008, Bevan's identity was revealed by The Independent and confirmed by Hyperdub. In the following years, he went on to collaborate with Four Tet, Massive Attack, Thom Yorke and Zomby in addition to releasing a series of long-form EPs such as Kindred (2012), Truant / Rough Sleeper (2012), and Rival Dealer (2013); most of these releases were later compiled on the 2019 compilation Tunes 2011â€“2019. He has remained reclusive, giving few interviews and avoiding public appearances. AllMusic described him as \"one of the most acclaimed, influential, and enigmatic electronic musicians of the early 21st century.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burial_(musician)> .

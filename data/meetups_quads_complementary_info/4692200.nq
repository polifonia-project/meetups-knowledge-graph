<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marilyn_Wilson-Rutherford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Marilyn Wilson-Rutherford (n√©e Rovell; born February 6, 1948) is an American singer who is best known as the first wife of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. Raised in Los Angeles, she started her singing career in the late 1950s, initially as part of a family singing trio, the Rovell Sisters, with her siblings Diane and Barbara. Through a mutual connection with musician Gary Usher, Marilyn met Brian at a Beach Boys concert in August 1962 when she was 14 and Brian was 20. Brian subsequently renamed the Rovell Sisters to \"the Honeys\" and wrote and produced several of their records in the 1960s. Marilyn married Brian in December 1964 and together had two children, Carnie and Wendy Wilson, who later formed two-thirds of Wilson Phillips. The couple's early marital struggles were reflected in the pessimistic and dejected lyrical content from the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds (particularly the songs \"Caroline, No\" and \"You Still Believe in Me\"). In 1971, she and Diane formed American Spring, with Brian again acting as producer and songwriter. Marilyn and Brian ultimately divorced in 1979, due in part to Brian's longstanding issues with mental illness and drug abuse. She continues to occasionally perform concerts with the Honeys." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marilyn_Wilson-Rutherford> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nina_Nastasia> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nina Maria Nastasia (/nəˈstɑːziə/ nuh-stAH-ssee-uh; born May 13, 1966) is an American folk singer-songwriter. A native of Los Angeles, she first came to prominence in New York City in 2000 after Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel began giving her debut album, Dogs, airplay. The album earned Nastasia a cult following, and was re-released in 2004. Her fifth studio album release, You Follow Me (2007), was a collaboration with Australian drummer Jim White of Dirty Three. As of 2022, Nastasia has released a total of seven studio albums, each recorded by Steve Albini. Her musical style has been described as folk and country-influenced with neo-Gothic overtones, often featuring sparse acoustic guitar accompanied by string arrangements." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nina_Nastasia> .

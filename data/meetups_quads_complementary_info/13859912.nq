He is a founding member of the hip hop group The Sugarhill Gang. On the band's signature song, \"Rapper's Delight\", he raps, \"I said M-A-S, T-E-R, a G with a double E, I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee\". He was 17 at the time of recording the song, alluded to by the lyric, \"I guess by now you can take a hunch, and find that I am the baby of the bunch\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Master_Gee_(musician)> .

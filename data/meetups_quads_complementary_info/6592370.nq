<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luca_Turilli> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Luca Turilli (born 5 March 1972) is an Italian composer, arranger, producer and multi-instrumentalist constantly engaged in various musical projects. Having always declared to love music at 360 degrees, Turilli has dedicated himself to multiple musical genres, ranging from trance and electronic music of his first compositions to symphonic metal inspired by the world of soundtracks and also to modern pop and piano compositions of his current productions. He is one of the founders of the symphonic power metal band Rhapsody, later called Rhapsody of Fire., band for which he composed and arranged all music with his colleague Alex Staropoli from 1997 until the friendly split of 2011. After 2011 he released three more albums under the name Luca Turilli's Rhapsody and one under the name Turilli / Lione Rhapsody. In the early 2000s he also worked on a trilogy of solo albums as Luca Turilli, and released one album under the name of Luca Turilli's Dreamquest, a symphonic metal / rock project combined with electro pop elements he worked on alongside Dominique Leurquin. Though his lyrics in Rhapsody of Fire dealt with epic, sword and sorcery high fantasy, namely a saga of his own design, the lyrics of his later albums speak mainly about science, metaphysics, psychology, anthropology and are generally related with the mysteries of life - Turilli's greatest passion after what he started experiencing thanks to his long-term yoga and meditation practices. In 2020, with the piano being one of his favorite instruments, he also announced his entry into the market of modern, emotional and cinematic piano with the release of his debut piano album, in the tradition of artists like Yann Tiersen, Ludovico Einaudi and Yiruma, some of the well-known piano composers of our time and a true inspiration to him, underlining his need for continuous artistic challenges and the need to express himself at 360 degrees." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luca_Turilli> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lemon Henry \"Blind Lemon\" Jefferson (September 24, 1893 â€“ December 19, 1929) was an American blues and gospel singer-songwriter and musician. He was one of the most popular blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the \"Father of the Texas Blues\". Due mainly to his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing, Jefferson's performances were distinctive. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. Later blues and rock and roll musicians, however, did attempt to imitate both his songs and his musical style." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson> .

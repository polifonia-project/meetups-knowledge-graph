<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sara_Tea> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sara Tea (born May 13, 1978) is an American musician, DJ, artist, and producer. She is best known for creating Danceotron, Denver, Colorado’s “No Bullshit Dance Party.” Born Sara Thurston in Tucson, Arizona, her family moved to seven different states before settling in New Jersey for her high school years. She attended Princeton High School, which is known for its strong music and arts programs. In 2015, she was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a form of dysautonomia. This caused her to have issues drumming and performing basic tasks, leading her to take a hiatus from 2017-2020. Her first solo EP Soft Revenge is expected to be released in 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sara_Tea> .

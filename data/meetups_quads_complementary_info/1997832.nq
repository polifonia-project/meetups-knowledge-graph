<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grant_Hart> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Grantzberg Vernon Hart (March 18, 1961 – September 13, 2017) was an American musician, best known as the drummer and co-songwriter for the punk rock band Hüsker Dü. After the band's breakup in 1988, he released his first solo album Intolerance before forming the alternative rock trio Nova Mob, where he moved to vocals and guitar. His solo career became his main focus after the dissolution of Nova Mob in 1997. As the co-songwriter of Hüsker Dü, Hart's songs (such as \"The Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill\" and \"Turn on the News\") received praise from critics and contemporaries. His vocal style, in contrast to that of Hüsker Dü bandmate Bob Mould, had a more measured and melodic delivery. His choice of lyrical themes, which ranged from teenage alienation in \"Standing by the Sea\" and the depiction of a murder in \"Diane,\" to playful story-telling in \"Books About UFOs,\" helped to expand the subject matter of hardcore punk. Hart died on September 13, 2017 of complications from liver cancer and hepatitis C." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grant_Hart> .

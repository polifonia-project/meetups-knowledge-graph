He came to fame as a teen pop singer in the late 1990s, establishing himself as a star among preteen and teenage audiences during the first years of the 21st century, with his four studio albums. Carter began performing at age seven, after the formation of his brother Nick's group the Backstreet Boys, and released his self-titled debut album in 1997 at age nine, selling a million copies worldwide. His second album Aaron's Party (Come Get It) (2000) sold three million copies in the United States, and Carter began making guest appearances on Nickelodeon and touring with the Backstreet Boys shortly after the record's release. Carter's next album, Oh Aaron, also went platinum, and in 2002 the musician released what would be his last studio album in over 15 years, Another Earthquake!, followed by his 2003 Most Requested Hits collection. Carter appeared on Dancing with the Stars, and in the Broadway musical Seussical and the off-Broadway musical The Fantasticks, and made several one-off performances. In 2014, he released a single featuring rapper Pat SoLo, \"Ooh Wee\". Carter released the single \"Fool's Gold\" in 2016, and an EP titled Love in 2017. His fifth studio album, also titled Love, was released in 2018. A sixth and final album, Blacklisted, was released two days after his death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Carter> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clay_Smith_(cricketer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clay James Smith (born 15 January 1971) is a former Bermudian international cricketer who represented the Bermudian national team between 1991 and 2007. He is Bermuda's current head coach, having been appointed in December 2015. Having debuted for Bermuda in 1991, Smith first came to notice at the 1994 ICC Trophy in Kenya, where he ranked fourth in overall runs scored and helped his team to the semi-finals. He remained one of Bermuda's leading batsmen for over a decade, appearing in another three ICC Trophy tournaments and also in several editions of the West Indian domestic one-day competition (where Bermuda competed as a guest team). In the 1997â€“98 Red Stripe Bowl, Smith scored two centuries (against the Windward Islands and Jamaica), becoming the first Bermudian to score a List A hundred. He was appointed captain of Bermuda in 2004, and served in the position until the end of 2006, although he missed a number of matches due to injury towards the end of his tenure. Smith retired from international cricket after the 2007 World Cup." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clay_Smith_(cricketer)> .

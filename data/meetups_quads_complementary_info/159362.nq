<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy_Jr.> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. (November 25, 1960 â€“ July 16, 1999), often referred to as John-John or JFK Jr., was an American lawyer, journalist, and magazine publisher. He was a son of the 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and a younger brother of Caroline Kennedy. Three days after his father was assassinated, he rendered a final salute during the funeral procession on his third birthday. From his childhood years at the White House, Kennedy was the subject of much media scrutiny, and later became a popular social figure in Manhattan. Trained as a lawyer, he worked as a New York City assistant district attorney for almost four years. In 1995, he launched George magazine, using his political and celebrity status to publicize it. He died in a plane crash in 1999 at the age of 38." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_F._Kennedy_Jr.> .

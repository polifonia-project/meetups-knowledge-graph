<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arikkad_Varghese> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Arikkad Varghese (Malayalam: അരിക്കാട് വർഗീസ്, 14 June 1938 - 18 February 1970), popularly known as Saghavu Varghese (സഖാവ് വർഗീസ്), was an Indian CPIML leader, who fought mainly to protect the Adivasis in Wayanad from the exploitation of the feudal lords who were primarily members of political parties and the police system which then aided the exploitation, during the 1960s. Arikkad Varghese is especially notable in the history of Kerala, for being murdered by the police in a fake encounter, and the truth of this incident which remained unknown for 40 years. After 40 years, the very policeman who fired the shot revealed to the world that he had murdered him, and called for a trial. In the course of the trial, the now-old policeman died before he could testify before the court. A colleague of his testified, and one senior police officer who ordered the murder was convicted and sentenced by the court. CPIML leaders and activists who worked with Arikkad Varghese were Ajitha, and Grow Vasu." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arikkad_Varghese> .

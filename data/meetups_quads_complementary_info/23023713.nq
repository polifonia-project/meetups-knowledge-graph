<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Warren> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jerry Warren (March 10, 1925 â€“ August 21, 1988) was an American film director, producer, editor, screenwriter, cinematographer, and actor. Warren grew up wanting to get into the film business in Los Angeles, California. He appeared in small parts in a few 1940s films such as Ghost Catchers, Anchors Aweigh, and Unconquered. After meeting with producers, Warren took on his first film as a director and producer with Man Beast in 1956. He initially created his own films, although relying heavily on stock footage. Later, he would just buy foreign films that already existed and re-edit them, dubbing some scenes in English and inserting new footage which he shot with American actors such as John Carradine and Katherine Victor. Warren even wrote some screenplays for his films under the pen name \"Jacques Lecoutier\", which he sometimes misspelled in the credits." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Warren> .

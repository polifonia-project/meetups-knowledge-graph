<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Callis> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Donald Callis (born October 13, 1963) is a Canadian professional wrestling manager, color commentator, and former professional wrestler and business executive. He is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he works as the on-screen manager of Kenny Omega and as a backstage consultant. A former wrestler, Callis spent the majority of his career performing as either Cyrus (shortened from Cyrus the Virus) or Don Callis. He first gained international attention working under the name The Jackyl for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). While in the WWF, Callis managed a group known as The Truth Commission and later managed The Oddities and The Acolytes before being released in 1999. From 1999 to 2001, he worked for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as a manager and commentator, during which he was portrayed as a fictional \"network representative\" who headed a group known as The Network. In 2003, he was introduced as an on-screen character for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and returned to the company, now called Impact Wrestling, in 2017 becoming an executive vice president and commentator for the promotion. While with Impact, Callis also worked for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) where he served as an English language commentator on NJPW World. In 2020, through Impact's relationship with AEW, Callis began appearing on AEW programming. The following year in 2021, Callis' time as Impact executive vice president came to an end, with Callis remaining in the company as an on-air talent until October 2021 when the AEW and Impact partnership ended." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Callis> .

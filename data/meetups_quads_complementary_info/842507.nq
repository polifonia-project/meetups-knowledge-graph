<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frankie_Trumbauer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Orie Frank Trumbauer (May 30, 1901 â€“ June 11, 1956) was an American jazz saxophonist of the 1920s and 1930s. His main instrument was the C-melody saxophone, a now-uncommon instrument between an alto and tenor saxophone in size and pitch. He also played alto saxophone, bassoon, clarinet and several other instruments. He was a composer of sophisticated sax melodies, one of the major small group jazz bandleaders of the 1920s and 1930s. His landmark recording of \"Singin' the Blues\" with Bix Beiderbecke and Eddie Lang in 1927, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1977. His major recordings included \"Krazy Kat\", \"Red Hot\", \"Plantation Moods\", \"Trumbology\", \"Tailspin\", \"Singin' the Blues\", \"Wringin' an' Twistin'\", and \"For No Reason at All in C\" with Bix Beiderbecke and Eddie Lang, and the first hit recording of \"Georgia On My Mind\" in 1931. \"Tram\" was described as one of the most influential and important jazz saxophonists of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly influencing the sound of Lester Young. He is also remembered for his musical collaborations with Bix Beiderbecke, a relationship that produced some of the finest and most innovative jazz records of the late 1920s. Trumbauer and Beiderbecke also collaborated with jazz guitarist Eddie Lang. He was featured in the 2001 documentary Jazz by Ken Burns on PBS on the topic of the first jazz soloists and as an iconic image to symbolize jazz music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frankie_Trumbauer> .

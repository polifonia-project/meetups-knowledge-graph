<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simone_Sello> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Simone Sello (born July 4, 1968) is an Italian born guitarist, music producer, composer, filmmaker and music journalist. He is known for his work with the Sanremo Festival Orchestra,Chicanery, Billy Sheehan, Aaron Carter, Disney, Hannah Montana, Vasco Rossi, Amber Lily, and Warren Cuccurullo, both as a producer and guitarist; and as a journalist for the magazines Chitarre, Strumenti Musicali, Accordo and Ganzo. He is an owner of music production companies RedRum Productions and MusicDemoProducer.com, with each company oriented towards a distinct clientele: RedRum Productions is geared towards contemporary music production for artists, film and TV and MusicDemoProducer.com aims to bring a simplified approach to professional music production to any user, over the web. His musical upbringing is based on classical violin studies, as well as watching and hearing his father play guitar, but he never took a formal guitar lesson, in spite of his career as a guitar player.His influences include major classical and jazz composers and performers, (Bach, Ravel, Miles Davis, Weather Report), pop and rock acts (The Beatles, David Bowie, Pink Floyd, Metallica, Lucio Battisti), and experimental artists (Luciano Berio, Brian Eno, Terje Rypdal, Klaus Schulze). Equally interested in performing, composing and producing music, Simone started getting hired to play guitar for recording sessions and live performances by artists in his hometown Rome when he was 17 years old, and eventually became known on a national level. While building a long list of musical collaborations, he started writing articles for magazines, thus achieving a different kind of exposure, still in the music field. At the age of 29, he moved to Los Angeles to push his musician and journalist careers, by joining a big international scene." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simone_Sello> .

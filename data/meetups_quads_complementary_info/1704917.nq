<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Quilico> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Louis Quilico, CC (January 14, 1925 â€“ July 15, 2000) was a Canadian opera singer. One of the leading dramatic baritones of his day, he was an ideal interpreter of the great Italian and French composers, especially Giuseppe Verdi. He was often referred to as \"Mr Rigoletto\" in reference to the Verdi opera. During his 45-year-long career he shared performing credits with opera's greatest stars. He spent 25 consecutive years at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. After his retirement from the stage in 1998 he continued to perform and record, most often with his second wife, pianist Christina Petrowska Quilico, CM OOnt FRSC, with whom he made four CDs. The couple also toured together extensively in concerts until Quilico's death in 2000. Quilico received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts, in November 1999 for his lifetime contribution to classical music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Quilico> .

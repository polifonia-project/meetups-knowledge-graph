<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Park_Si-yeon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Park Si-yeon (born Park Mi-seon on March 29, 1979) is a South Korean actress. She joined the Miss Korea pageant in 2000, and using that as a springboard to an acting career, she made her acting debut in China in 2004, appearing in minor roles in several CCTV dramas. In 2005 Park was cast in her first starring role in the Korean drama My Girl, though at the time she was more known for dating actor-singer Eric Mun. As she built her filmography in the following years, Park overcame early criticism of her acting skills and eventually gained respect as an actress in TV series such as Bitter Sweet Life, Coffee House and The Innocent Man, as well as the films The Fox Family, A Love, and The Scent." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Park_Si-yeon> .

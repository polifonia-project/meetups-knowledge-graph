She is dubbed as \"Asia's Queen of Songs\" and is widely known for her rendition of \"Kapantay ay Langit\" which eventually became her signature song. Corrales was among the most successful Filipino musical artists in the 1960s. She was one of the first female artists to reach number one on the Australian music chart with her 1959 single \"Come Closer to Me.\" In 1963, her single \"A Million Thanks to You\" became one of the few songs by local artists to reach number one on the Philippine chart in the 1960s. She became a judge on the first season of The X Factor Philippines, which began airing in 2012." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pilita_Corrales> .

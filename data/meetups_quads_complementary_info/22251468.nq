<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orelsan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Aurélien Cotentin (French pronunciation: ​[ɔʁeljɛ̃ kɔtɑ̃tɛ̃]; born 1 August 1982), better known by his stage name Orelsan, sometimes stylized as OrelSan (French: [ɔʁɛlˈsan]), is a French rapper, songwriter, record producer, actor and film director. He has released four studio albums: his debut Perdu d'avance on 16 February 2009, his second album Le chant des sirènes on 26 September 2011, his third album La fête est finie on 20 October 2017 and his fourth album Civilisation on 19 November 2021. He is also one half of the French hip hop duo Casseurs Flowters, along with Gringe, with whom he has released two studio albums: Orelsan et Gringe sont les Casseurs Flowters in 2013, and the original soundtrack for their 2015 film Comment c'est loin. Orelsan's artistry and rapping technique has drawn him comparisons to American rap legend Eminem on several occasions, primarily because both are prominent white rappers and both are known for their ability to switch between or combine violent and comical rapping techniques." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orelsan> .

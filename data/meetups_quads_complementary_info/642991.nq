Considered one of the forerunners of the new jack swing sound in hip hop, he gained fame in the 1980s as a member of one of the pioneering groups in hip hop music, the Treacherous Three, and for his later solo career. During his career he released a total of seven studio albums (five of them solo), with 1994's Interlude being the last to date. His fast and aggressive rap style influenced following rap figures such as Big Daddy Kane, Beastie Boys, KRS-One, Rakim, Will Smith, N.W.A, Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay-Z, among others. Among his most famous songs are \"Go See the Doctor\", \"Wild Wild West\" and \"How Ya Like Me Now\". Kool Moe Dee was ranked No. 33 on About.com's list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987â€“2007)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kool_Moe_Dee> .

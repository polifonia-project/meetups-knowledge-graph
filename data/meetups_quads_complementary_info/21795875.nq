Skull Duggery made his first appearance on No Limit's 1995 compilation, Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin' on the song entitled \"Darkside\". About a year later, Master P released a trailer on Silkk the Shocker's first album The Shocker promoting Duggery's debut album, and setting the album's release date for September 24, 1996, but the release was pushed back to a week later. Skull Duggery released Hoodlum Fo' Life on October 1, 1996, under the alias Skull Dugrey, but the album failed to sell well, only peaking at #29 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and #8 on the Top Heatseekers. His next album, 1998's These Wicked Streets fared much better, making it to #21 on the Billboard 200 and #4 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After leaving No Limit in 1999, Skull Duggery independently released 2000's 3rd Ward Stepper and 2003's Controversy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skull_Duggery_(rapper)> .

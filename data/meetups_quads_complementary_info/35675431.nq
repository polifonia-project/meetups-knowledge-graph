As a songwriter, he had a hand in creating several of the group's biggest hits, including \"Aum Aum,\" \"Shake Shake,\" \"Te Necessito\" and \"No Me Voy.\" He has also recorded solo albums, starred on telenovelas and in films. OV7 disbanded in 2003 and the OV7 brand remained inactive until Borovoy and five members reunited in 2010. During the interim, Borovoy launched a solo career, starting with an acting role on the Televisa telenovela Clap... El Lugar De Tus Sue√±os. His first solo album, Ari Borovoy, appeared in 2005, with the single \"Booming\" emerging as a hit. Borovoy had a hand in writing nine of the album's tracks. Borovoy's second solo album, Pasajero, was released in 2008. The disc was issued under Borovoy's own label, BoBo Producciones, and he produced the album and wrote five songs. The first single was titled \"Vivo\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ari_Borovoy> .

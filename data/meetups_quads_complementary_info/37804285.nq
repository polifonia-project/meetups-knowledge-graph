<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fuka_Kakimoto> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Fuka Kakimoto (柿本 風香, Kakimoto Fūka, born August 20, 1984) is a Japanese retired professional wrestler, mixed martial artist and model better known simply as Fuka (風香, Fūka) (pronounced and sometimes transliterated as \"Fuuka\"). She was trained by JDStar as part of the promotion's \"Athtress\" program and made her debut in February 2004, quickly garnering a large fan following. From 2005 to 2006, Fuka also fought three mixed martial arts fights, finishing with a record of two wins and one loss. During her years in JDStar, Fuka became the inaugural Princess of Pro-Wrestling (POP) Champion and also held the Princess of Ketsudeka (POK) and TWF World Tag Team Championships. After the promotion folded in July 2007, Fuka became a freelancer, while also starting to promote her own series of independent wrestling events under the banner of Fuka Matsuri (\"Fuka Festival\"). As a freelancer, Fuka also made several trips to Mexico, working for local independent promotions. Fuka ended her in-ring career in March 2010 at the age of 25, after which she began training wrestlers for the newly founded World Wonder Ring Stardom promotion. When Stardom was officially announced the following September, Fuka was appointed the General Manager of the promotion, a role she has held since. As a model, Fuka is signed to the Platinum Production agency. Her older brother, Daichi, is also a professional wrestler, most notably working for Dramatic Dream Team (DDT) between 2003 and 2014, and her father Masahide and oldest brother Genki have also made appearances in wrestling matches involving her." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fuka_Kakimoto> .

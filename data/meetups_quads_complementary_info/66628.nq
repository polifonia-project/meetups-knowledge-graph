<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poe_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Poe (born Anne Decatur Danielewski; March 23, 1968) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Poe's musical style is a blend of rock, jazz, electronica, folk, and hip hop elements combined with intimate lyrical compositions. Many of Poe's songs have been featured in films and on television. Poe first hit the modern rock charts in 1995. Some of her early charting singles included \"Angry Johnny\", \"Trigger Happy Jack\", \"Hello\", and \"Hey Pretty.\" Videos for these singles had heavy rotation on MTV. Poe spent six years with Atlantic Records and is currently on her own label, Repoezessed Music Records. Noteworthy was Poe's early involvement with her online community of fans. Her web site, and the fan sites that supported her early in her career, predated modern social networking platforms and were among the first of their kind. Atlantic Records' Senior Vice President of New Media, Nikki Sleight, referred to Poe's online power and one-on-one communication with thousands attending her concerts as \"unheard of and pretty phenomenal\" in Sleight's 1997 interview with Web Magazine. In 2004, she co-founded the digital innovations agency Signature Creative Inc with John Gheur. In September 2014, Poe received the title of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador due to her invitation by Yoko Ono to participate in a UNICEF campaign and her donated performance. The campaign launched a world version of John Lennon's classic song \"Imagine\" featuring dozens of musical artists from around the world. Poe joined others singing in the music video that included a video clip of John Lennon that spearheads a global campaign by UNICEF to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poe_(singer)> .

After initially writing hits for others, she had her own chart hits in the UK and Europe in the 1970s, starting with UK top 10 single \"Sugar Me\", and became the first British female artist to achieve a number one with a self-written song (in 1972 in Belgium, Spain and The Netherlands). She represented the UK in the 1977 Eurovision Song Contest, scoring another chart-topping hit in Switzerland and had a successful career as a two-time Ivor Novello Award-winning composer, record producer, actress and television celebrity." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lynsey_de_Paul> .

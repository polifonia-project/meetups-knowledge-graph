He was also the first elected president in Singapore's history. A former member of the governing People's Action Party (PAP) and Ong served as Chairman of the People's Action Party between 1981 and 1993, after Toh Chin Chye stepped down from the position.

He was sworn on 1 September 1993 as the fifth president of Singapore. He decided not to run for a second term as president in 1999 partially due to the death of his wife.

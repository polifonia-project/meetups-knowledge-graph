<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wei_Wei_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wei Wei (simplified Chinese: 韦唯; traditional Chinese: 韋唯; pinyin: Wéi Wéi; born 28 September 1963) is a Chinese mandopop singer, philanthropist, and current Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party since 2010. She previously served as Standing Committee Member of the All-China Youth Federation from 2005 to 2010, as China's Forestry Ambassador to the United Nations of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration from 2009 to 2010, and as Ambassador of the Chinese Football Association from 2008 to 2009. In 2022, she was appointed Visiting Professor of Music and a doctoral advisor specializing in vocal music at Shinawatra University, a private international university in Thailand established by former Prime Minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra. Her breakthrough came in 1986 when she won the National Young Singers contest on Chinese television and The 24th Sopot International Song Festival in Poland, when she also won the \"Miss Photo Category\", and four years later, she was chosen to perform at the 11th Asian Games in Beijing, singing a duet with Spanish singer Julio Iglesias at the 1993 East Asian Games in Shanghai. Largely associated with sports and the Olympics, Wei has been an Olympic Ambassador for China since 1993 when the Chinese Olympic Committee applied for the games for the first time. She supported the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics by performing at major Olympic events in China and abroad, and in an internet survey conducted in 2004 regarding who should sing the theme song of the Chinese Olympics, she received the most votes. She was the only representative for Asia at the 100 Year Anniversary Show for the Olympic Games in Atlanta, USA in 1996, and has previously performed at the opening ceremony of the Shanghai World Expo, the closing ceremony of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, and at the opening and closing ceremonies of the 11th National Games in Nanjing, China. Her songs have become the official theme songs for major Chinese sporting events, such as in 2006 when her single I Want to Fly was appointed as the official theme song for the 2008 Olympic Sailing events held in Qingdao by the Chinese Olympic Committee and the Sailing Committee of Qingdao, and in 2007, she was named the \"Queen of Sports\" by the All-China Women's Federation." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wei_Wei_(singer)> .

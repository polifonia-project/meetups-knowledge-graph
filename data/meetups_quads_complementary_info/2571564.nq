He was a founding member of The La De Das, the leader of Kevin Borich Express, and a founding member of The Party Boys, as well as a session musician for numerous acts. Borich wrote \"Gonna See My Baby Tonight\" for The La De Das, which became a top 10 hit in 1971 on the Australian singles chart. He performed at some of Australia's biggest rock events including the 1972 Sunbury Pop Festival and the late 1970s tours with 60,000 people, featuring Fleetwood Mac, Santana and The Little River Band. He played in two New Year's Eve celebrations at the Sydney Opera House with 70,000 people as well as support shows for international acts including Elton John, Status Quo, Jeff Beck and Buddy Guy. Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane has described Borich as \"one of the most celebrated guitar players in the history of Australian rock. He also remains an underrated songwriter, and his live reputation has rarely been reflected in record sales\". His son Lucius Borich joined Kevin Borich Express as a drummer and was later a member of Sydney-based progressive rock band Cog." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Borich> .

He has written music for television, film, theatre, dance and live performances on concert stages throughout the United States, Europe and Japan. Colina is best known as producer and writer on recordings for musicians Bob James, David Sanborn, Michael Brecker, Marcus Miller, Bill Evans and Michael Franks. He has won three gold albums, has received four Grammy Award nominations, and won three Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. In 2006, Colina dramatically shifted his music career to focus on writing classical, jazz and Latin music compositionsâ€”distinctive mashups that reflect his deep musical roots in his father's homeland of Cuba." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Colina> .

He was a son of Charles King (1912-1972), who acquired and marketed the Hal Roach produced comedy series of shorts films Our Gang (later renamed The Little Rascals) from the 1930s and established a company in 1964 to market and syndicate them, then known as King World Productions or Entertainment, which was acquired in 2000 by CBS Productions (a subsidiary of the CBS Corporation, formerly the Columbia Broadcasting System). He was inducted into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame in 1992 and the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2004 and is credited with launching the careers of such top television stars as Oprah Winfrey, Phil McGraw and Alex Trebek." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_King_(producer)> .

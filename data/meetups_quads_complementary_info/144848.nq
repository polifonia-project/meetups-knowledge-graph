<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sinéad_O'Connor> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shuhada Sadaqat (born Sinéad Marie Bernadette O'Connor on 8 December 1966; /ʃɪˈneɪd/) is an Irish singer-songwriter. Her debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, was released in 1987 and charted internationally. Her second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got received glowing reviews upon release and became her biggest success, selling over seven million copies worldwide. Its lead single, \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" (written by Prince), was named the number one world single in 1990 by the Billboard Music Awards. She has released ten studio albums: 1992's Am I Not Your Girl? and 1994's Universal Mother both went gold in the UK, 2000's Faith and Courage received gold status in Australia, and 2005's Throw Down Your Arms went gold in Ireland. Her work also includes songs for films, collaborations with many other artists, and appearances at charity fundraising concerts. Her 2021 memoir Rememberings was a best seller. Throughout her music career she has been unabashedly honest about her spiritual journey, activism, socio-political views, as well as her trauma and mental health struggles. In 1999 she was ordained as a priest by the Latin Tridentine Church, a sect that is not recognized by the mainstream Catholic Church. She consistently speaks out on issues related to child abuse, human rights, anti-racism, organised religion, and women's rights.In 2017, O'Connor changed her name to Magda Davitt. After converting to Islam in 2018, she changed it to Shuhada' Sadaqat (Arabic: شهداء صدقات). However, she continues to record and perform under her birth name." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sinéad_O'Connor> .

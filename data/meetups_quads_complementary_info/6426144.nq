<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lani_Hall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lani Hall (born November 6, 1945) is an American singer, lyricist, and author. From 1966 to 1971 she performed as lead vocalist for Sérgio Mendes & Brasil '66. In 1972 Hall released her first solo album, Sun Down Lady. She may be best known, however, for providing the most recognizable (female) face and (female) vocal signature sound to Sérgio's group during her tenure there, and for her rendition of the theme song to the 1983 James Bond film, Never Say Never Again, with its accompanying video, in which she prominently appears. In 1986 she was awarded her first Grammy for Es Fácil Amar, as \"Best Latin Pop Performance.\" After that year, Hall largely retired, resurfacing in 1998 with the solo album Brasil Nativo. She has recorded more than 22 albums in three different languages and has released three albums on which she performs alongside her husband, Herb Alpert: Anything Goes, I Feel You and Steppin' Out. Hall received her second Grammy Award in 2013 as the producer for the album Steppin' Out." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lani_Hall> .

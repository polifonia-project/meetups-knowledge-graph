<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seth_(cartoonist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gregory Gallant (born September 16, 1962), better known by his pen name Seth, is a Canadian cartoonist. He is best known for his series Palookaville and his mock-autobiographical graphic novel It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken (1996). Seth draws in a style influenced by the classic cartoonists of The New Yorker. His work is highly nostalgic, especially for the early-to-mid-20th Century period, and of Southern Ontario. His work also shows a great depth and breadth of knowledge of the history of comics and cartooning." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seth_(cartoonist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graeme_Fowler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Graeme \"Foxy\" Fowler (born 20 April 1957) is an English former professional cricketer and cricket coach, who played for Lancashire County Cricket Club, England, and later for Durham. He appeared in 21 Test matches and 26 One Day International (ODIs) for England, averaging 35.32 in his Test batting career. After his playing career he founded the centre of excellence scheme at Durham MCCU based at Durham University in 1996, the success of which led the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to establish five more centres; Fowler stepped down as head coach in 2015, after changes in the scheme. The cricket writer Colin Bateman noted: \"a risk-taking left-hander, Fowler rarely bored anyone with his batting\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graeme_Fowler> .

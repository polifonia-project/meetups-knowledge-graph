<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unlike_Pluto> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Armond Arabshahi, known by his stage name Unlike Pluto, is an American singer, songwriter, DJ and record producer. The name Unlike Pluto developed from holding onto his outcast persona. He is known for his Pluto Tapes series of albums, where he challenges himself to release one song per week starting from May 2018. Besides his Unlike Pluto project, he has a side project with Hamilton singer Joanna Jones called Why Mona where they create covers of old school classics. Arabshahi has also been working on a manga project since 2021, currently naming it Dada Immortal, alongside which he is learning Japanese. This is followed with him launching a discord server in 2019 that got raided, and therefore deleted, back in 2021, after which he made another server, where he has pre-releases on Tuesdays where members get a preview of the upcoming song." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unlike_Pluto> .

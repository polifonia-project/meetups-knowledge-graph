<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Arkwright> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Richard Arkwright (23 December 1732 â€“ 3 August 1792) was an English inventor and a leading entrepreneur during the early Industrial Revolution. He is credited as the driving force behind the development of the spinning frame, known as the water frame after it was adapted to use water power; and he patented a rotary carding engine to convert raw cotton to 'cotton lap' prior to spinning. He was the first to develop factories housing both mechanised carding and spinning operations. Arkwright's achievement was to combine power, machinery, semi-skilled labour and the new raw material of cotton to create mass-produced yarn. His organisational skills earned him the accolade \"father of the modern industrial factory system,\" notably through the methods developed in his mill at Cromford, Derbyshire (now preserved as part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Arkwright> .

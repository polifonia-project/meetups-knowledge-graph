<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlos_Santana> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Carlos Humberto Santana Barragán (Spanish: [.karlos sanˈtana]; born July 20, 1947) is an American guitarist who rose to fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his band Santana, which pioneered a fusion of Rock and roll and Latin American jazz. Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin American and African rhythms played on percussion instruments not generally heard in rock, such as timbales and congas. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. In 2015, Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 20 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists. He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, and was inducted along with his namesake band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlos_Santana> .

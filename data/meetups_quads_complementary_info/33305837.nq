He wrote several hit songs including \"All I Ever Need Is You\" co-written with Jimmy Holiday and recorded by many artists including Ray Charles, Sonny & Cher, Ray Sanders, Andre Hazes, Tom Jones, Sammi Smith, Chet Atkins & Jerry Reed and Kenny Rogers & Dottie West; \"Rings\", co-written with Alex Harvey and recorded by Cymarron, Lobo, Reuben Howell, Leo Kottke, Twiggy, Tompall and The Glaser Brothers, Lonnie Mack (a vocal rendition from the guitar man of \"Memphis\" hit record fame), and other artists; \"Don't Change on Me\" co-written with Jimmy Holiday and recorded by Ray Charles, B.B. King, Van Morrison (recorded for Warner Bros. but available only on an Italian bootleg album), and by Alan Jackson; \"If You Wouldn't Be My Lady\", co-written with Jimmy Holiday and recorded by both Ray Charles and Charlie Rich; and \"It’s a Hang Up Baby\", recorded by both Jerry Lee Lewis and Z.Z.

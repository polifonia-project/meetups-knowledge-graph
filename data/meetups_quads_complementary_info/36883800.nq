<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logic_(rapper)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Robert Bryson Hall II (born January 22, 1990), known professionally as Logic, is an American rapper and record producer. He has released seven studio albums and received two Grammy Award nominations. Logic began his music career in 2010, releasing his debut mixtape Young, Broke & Infamous; he gained popularity with his Young Sinatra mixtape series, with the response to its third iteration, Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever (2013), helping Logic secure a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. Logic's first two studio albums — Under Pressure (2014) and The Incredible True Story (2015) — both peaked within the top five on the U.S. Billboard 200, while the former was ultimately certified platinum. Logic achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Everybody; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its lead single, \"1-800-273-8255\", reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally. He also released the commercial mixtape series Bobby Tarantino. His fourth and fifth albums, YSIV (2018) and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2019), achieved similar commercial success, with the latter containing the single \"Homicide\", which peaked at number 5 on the Hot 100. After his sixth album No Pressure (2020), Logic retired from music; he returned to music in 2021 with Bobby Tarantino III. His seventh album, Vinyl Days, was released in 2022, his final album with Def Jam. As an author, Logic released the novel Supermarket (2019), which was accompanied by a soundtrack of the same name. The book became a New York Times Best Seller, but both works received generally mixed to negative critical reception. He published his memoir, This Bright Future, in 2021. Logic is also a streamer and is signed exclusively with Twitch, the first musician to be so." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logic_(rapper)> .

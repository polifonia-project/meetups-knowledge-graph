<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_A._Dorsey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Andrew Dorsey (July 1, 1899 â€“ January 23, 1993) was an American musician, composer, and Christian evangelist influential in the development of early blues and 20th-century gospel music. He penned 3,000 songs, a third of them gospel, including \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\" and \"Peace in the Valley\". Recordings of these sold millions of copies in both gospel and secular markets in the 20th century. Born in rural Georgia, Dorsey grew up in a religious family but gained most of his musical experience playing blues at barrelhouses and parties in Atlanta. He moved to Chicago and became a proficient composer and arranger of jazz and vaudeville just as blues was becoming popular. He gained fame accompanying blues belter Ma Rainey on tour and, billed as \"Georgia Tom\", joined with guitarist Tampa Red in a successful recording career. After a spiritual awakening, Dorsey began concentrating on writing and arranging religious music. Aside from the lyrics, he saw no real distinction between blues and church music, and viewed songs as a supplement to spoken word preaching. Dorsey served as the music director at Chicago's Pilgrim Baptist Church for 50 years, introducing musical improvisation and encouraging personal elements of participation such as clapping, stomping, and shouting in churches when these were widely condemned as unrefined and common. In 1932, he co-founded the , an organization dedicated to training musicians and singers from all over the U.S. that remains active. The first generation of gospel singers in the 20th century worked or trained with Dorsey: Sallie Martin, Mahalia Jackson, Roberta Martin, and James Cleveland, among others. Author Anthony Heilbut summarized Dorsey's influence by saying he \"combined the good news of gospel with the bad news of blues\". Called the \"Father of Gospel Music\" and often credited with creating it, Dorsey more accurately spawned a movement that popularized gospel blues throughout black churches in the United States, which in turn influenced American music and parts of society at large." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_A._Dorsey> .

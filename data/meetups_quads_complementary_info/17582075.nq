<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Dawa_Dolma> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alan Dawa Dolma (Tibetan: ཨ་ལན་ཟླ་བ་སྒྲོལ་མ་, ZYPY: Alan Dawazhouma; Chinese: 阿兰·达瓦卓玛; pinyin: Ālán Dáwǎzhuómǎ; born on 25 July 1987), known professionally as Alan, is a Tibetan singer and she is known for her signature \"Tibetan wail\", often incorporated into her music. She is a graduate of the PLA Academy of Art, majoring in vocal music and erhu, which she has played since childhood. During her time in college, Alan released a cover album titled Shengsheng Zui Rulan (2005). In early 2006, she auditioned for Japanese label Avex Trax and was subsequently signed as their first Tibetan artist. In late 2007, Alan moved to Tokyo and made her debut with \"Ashita e no Sanka\". She recorded the theme song to the film Red Cliff (2008), which brought wide exposure and is featured on her debut Japanese studio album, Voice of Earth (2009). In 2009, her ninth single \"Kuon no Kawa\" debuted at number three on the Oricon weekly charts, the highest placement by a singer from China. Her second Japanese studio album, My Life, came that same year. Following a slew of singles in 2010, including the Inuyasha: The Final Act ending theme \"Diamond\", Alan released the greatest hits album Japan Premium Best and began concentrating on promotional activities in China, where she has solely been active since. Her third Chinese album, Love Song, was released in 2012." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Dawa_Dolma> .

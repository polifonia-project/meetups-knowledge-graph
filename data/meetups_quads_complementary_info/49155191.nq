Since the early 1970s, she has taken a special interest in the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, making a careful analysis of his recorded performances as a pianist. Two books document the results of her work: Dmitri Shostakovich, Pianist and Shostakovich's Music for Piano Solo, Interpretation and Performance. She also contributed a chapter on piano music to A Shostakovich Companion, edited by Michael Mishra." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sofia_Moshevich> .

He played live for the most part, but he recorded with songwriter Peter Lack, and he appears in a Replacements video, \"When It Began,\" which received two 1991 MTV Video Music Awards nominations. Foley replaced founding member Chris Mars and toured Europe and the United States with the Replacements in support of their final album, All Shook Down, and played in their final show (prior to a reunion in 2013), which took place on July 4, 1991, in Chicago's Grant Park." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Foley_(drummer)> .

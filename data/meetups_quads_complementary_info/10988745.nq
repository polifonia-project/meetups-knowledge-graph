<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Newsom> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Penn Newsom (February 25, 1929 â€“ April 28, 2007) was a saxophone player in the NBC Orchestra on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, for which he later became assistant director. Newsom was frequently the band's substitute director, whenever music director Doc Severinsen was away from the show or filling in for announcer Ed McMahon. Nicknamed \"Mr. Excitement\" by Johnny Carson as an ironic take on his low-keyed, reserved persona, he was often a foil for Carson's humor. His conservative brown or blue suits were a marked contrast to Severinsen's flashy stage clothing." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Newsom> .

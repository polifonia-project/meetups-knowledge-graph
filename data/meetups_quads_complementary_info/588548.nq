He was the younger half-brother of Queen Mary I, as well as the older half-brother of Queen Elizabeth I and King Edward VI. Through his mother, he was the elder half-brother of the 4th Baroness Tailboys of Kyme and of the 2nd and 3rd Barons Tailboys of Kyme. He was named FitzRoy, which is derived from the Norman French term for \"son of the king\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_FitzRoy,_Duke_of_Richmond_and_Somerset> .

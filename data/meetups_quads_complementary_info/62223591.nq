<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Max_Friedrich_Meyer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Max Friedrich Meyer (June 14, 1873 â€“ March 14, 1967) was the first psychology professor who worked on psychoacoustics and taught at the University of Missouri. He was the founder of the theory of cochlear function, and was also an advocate for behaviourism as he argued in his book \"The Psychology of the Other\". During his time at the University of Missouri, he opened an experimental lab for Psychology and taught a variety of courses. His lab focused on behavioural zeitgeist and the studies of nervous system and behaviour. Meyer eventually moved to Miami and lived there from 1932 until the late 1950s. Afterwards, he moved to Virginia to stay with his daughter until his death in 1967." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Max_Friedrich_Meyer> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emily_Rodgers> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Emily Rodgers is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. She is signed to Shimmy-Disc, which is owned and operated by legendary indie producer Kramer, with whom she has worked for over a decade. Her music has been compared to Cat Power, Mazzy Star, Cowboy Junkies, Songs: Ohia, and Tara Jane O’Neil. Rodgers grew up in Elkhart, IN, and attended Goshen College, where she studied English and began writing music and performing. In 2003, she moved to Pittsburgh, PA, where she honed her craft and began performing in earnest. She released her first album in 2005, which was described as “post-rural, ethereal alt-country drenched in primo melancholy and reverb”. In 2008, Rodgers was approached by legendary indie producer Kramer, who is known for having produced Galaxie-500, Daniel Johnston, Low, Will Oldham, and Half Japanese. That same year, she signed to Misra Records, which was home to Great Lake Swimmers, Centro-matic, and Shearwater. In 2009, Misra released Rodgers’ second album, Bright Day, which she debuted at the label's South by Southwest Music Festival showcase. In 2016, Rodgers released her third album, Two Years, on Misra, again with Kramer at the helm. In 2019, Rodgers partnered with Kramer and her husband, guitarist Erik Cirelli, to write and record I Will Be Gone, her fourth LP. Written and recorded in just six days in her attic, the album utilizes lyrics by Rodgers and music by Cirelli. In addition to mixing, mastering, and producing the album, Kramer also serves as vocalist, bassist, pianist, and arranger, and the record belies an immediacy that is reflective of the time-limited nature of the recording process. The record was released in 2021 on Shimmy-Disc." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emily_Rodgers> .

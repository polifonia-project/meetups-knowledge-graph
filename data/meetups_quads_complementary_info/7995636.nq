<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harold_Ashby> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Harold Ashby (March 27, 1925, in Kansas City, Missouri, United States â€“ June 13, 2003, in New York City) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. He worked with Duke Ellington's band, replacing Jimmy Hamilton in 1968. In 1959, he recorded backing Willie Dixon on the latter's first album, Willie's Blues. After leaving the Duke Ellington Orchestra in 1975, Ashby worked as a freelance musician and took part in various reunions of Ellington alumni, as well as recording and gigging with his own bands. Ashby suffered a heart attack in May 2003, and was hospitalized before dying at the age of 78, on June 13 that year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harold_Ashby> .

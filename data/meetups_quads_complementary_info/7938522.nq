Born in the Deol family, he made his on-screen debut in 2005 with Imtiaz Ali's romantic comedy Socha Na Tha. After the modest success of his debut, Deol was praised for his performances in films such as Manorama Six Feet Under (2007) and Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye! (2008). His breakthrough role came in 2009 with the starring role as Dev in Anurag Kashyap's black comedy Dev.D, a modern-day adaptation of Devdas. Following the success of the film, Deol gained wider recognition. After mainly appearing in independent films early in his career, he starred in Zoya Akhtar's Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, a road trip film that went to become one of the highest-grossing films in Bollywood. His performance was well-received and earned him his first nomination for Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. Deol has since appeared in independent films including the drama Road, Movie (2010) and the war film Chakravyuh (2012), while simultaneously working in commercially successful films including the romantic drama Raanjhanaa (2013), and the romantic comedy Happy Bhag Jayegi (2016). He made his debut in Tamil language film Hero. Deol is noted for his portrayal of complex characters on screen, and is vociferous in his support for parallel cinema in India. Deol owns a production company, Forbidden Films which he established in 2009. In addition to his acting career, he is also an active philanthropist and supports various NGOs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abhay_Deol> .

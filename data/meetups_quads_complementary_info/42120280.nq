Regarded as one of the most popular modern rock musicians in the Albanian-speaking world, he is noted for his vocal range, vocal power, high-energy live performances, and is also recognised as an accomplished guitarist. Bushpepa and his band were the supporting acts on the concert tours of Deep Purple in 2007, Duff Mckagan (Guns N' Roses) in 2011 and Overkill in 2014. On 18 August 2013, he performed a full concert with Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal. Bushpepa is the sole author of his song which was reworked for the Eurovision by Jim Lowe, a Grammy Award-winning British record producer and audio engineer. In 2017, Bushpepa won the 56th edition of Festivali i Këngës with the song \"Mall\" and went on to represent Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon. He reached eleventh place in the grand final in a field of twenty-six and achieved the country's third highest placement to date." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eugent_Bushpepa> .

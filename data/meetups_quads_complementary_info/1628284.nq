<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_%22Stringbean%22_Akeman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Akeman (June 17, 1915 – November 10, 1973) better known as Stringbean (or String Bean), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, comedian, actor and semiprofessional baseball player best known for his role as a main cast member on the hit television show Hee Haw and as a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Akeman was well-known for his \"old-fashioned\" banjo-picking style, careful mix of comedy and music, and his memorable stage wardrobe (which consisted of a long nightshirt tucked into a pair of short blue jeans belted around his knees — giving him the comical appearance of a very tall man with stubby legs). Akeman and his wife were shot and murdered by burglars in their rural Tennessee home near Ridgetop in 1973." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_%22Stringbean%22_Akeman> .

Throughout his career, he has won numerous awards including 23 Latin Grammy Awards, threeGrammy Awards, and one Latin Billboard Music Award. Guerra won 3 Latin Grammy Awards in 2010, including Album of the Year. In 2012, he won the Latin Grammy Award for Producer of the Year. Guerra is one of the most internationally recognized Latin artists of recent decades. His popular style of merengue and Latin fusion has garnered him considerable success throughout Latin America. He is also credited for popularizing bachata music on a global level and is often associated with the genre, although his distinct style of bachata features a more traditional bolero rhythm and aesthetic mixed with bossa-nova influenced melodies and harmony in some of his songs. He does not limit himself to one style of music; instead, he incorporates diverse rhythms like merengue, bachata-fusion, balada, salsa, rock and roll, and even gospel. \"Ojalá Que Llueva Café\" (\"Let's hope it will rain coffee\") is one of his most critically acclaimed pieces." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juan_Luis_Guerra> .

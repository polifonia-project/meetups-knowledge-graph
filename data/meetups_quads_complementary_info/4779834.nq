He was best known for his performances with his father, Doc Watson. Merle played and recorded albums together with his father from age 15 until his death in a tractor accident 21 years later. Merle was widely recognized as one of the best flat-picking and slide guitarists of his generation. MerleFest, one of the world's largest and most-prestigious folk music festivals, is held annually in Wilkesboro, NC and is named in his honor. Merle and his father released a version of \"Bottle of Wine\" that reached No. 71 on the U.S. country chart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merle_Watson> .

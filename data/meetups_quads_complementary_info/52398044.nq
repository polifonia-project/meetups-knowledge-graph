The first release from HXV was a mixtape titled We Off That, which was introduced under Diplo's Mad Decent label. Following this was his debut EP titled Run the Trap. This included the song \"Flex\", which caught the attention of Diplo, later landing HXV the opportunity to remix Major Lazer's \"Jah No Partial\". The response to this remix was outstanding, thus securing him a spot in the community." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/HXV> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Ridgley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Herman Ridgley (October 30, 1925 â€“ August 11, 1999) was an American R&B singer, pianist, songwriter and bandleader in New Orleans, Louisiana. In a musical career lasting half a century Ridgley was a stalwart of the New Orleans rhythm and blues scene. Although he never had a national hit , unlike several of his contemporaries, he made numerous, popular recordings that sold mainly in New Orleans and Louisiana beginning in 1949 with a final release in 1995. His voice was variously described as similar to Roy Brown and Bull Moose Jackson and thus able to adapt to a variety of styles: Blues, Jump blues, Rhythm and Blues and Soul. In the late 50s he became bandleader of The Untouchables with whom he held residencies at important night venues often backing visiting artists. His recording career consisted of over forty singles and three albums. Most of his recordings have been anthologised on compilations in vinyl and CDs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Ridgley> .

Braithwaite made his full New Zealand debut in that country's inaugural A-international fixture, beating Australia 3–1 on 17 June 1922 and ended his international playing career with six A-international caps to his credit, his final cap an appearance in a 4–1 win over Australia on 30 June 1923. Braithwaite later served as a St Kilda borough councillor, representing the Labour Party." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rewi_Braithwaite> .

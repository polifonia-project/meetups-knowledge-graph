<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pushpa_Kamal_Dahal> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Nepali: पुष्पकमल दाहाल; born 11 December 1954 as Ghanashyam Dahal), also widely known by his nom de guerre Prachanda (Nepali: प्रचण्ड, pronounced [prʌˈt͡sʌɳɖʌ]), meaning \"fierce\", is a Nepalese politician who served as Prime Minister of Nepal from 2008 to 2009 and again from 2016 to 2017. Dahal was the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) during the country's civil war and subsequent peace process and the 1st Nepalese constituent assembly. In the 2008 elections, CPN(M) emerged as the largest party, and Dahal became Prime Minister in August of that year. He resigned from the post on 4 May 2009 after his attempt to sack the then army chief, General Rookmangud Katawal, was opposed by then President Ram Baran Yadav." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pushpa_Kamal_Dahal> .

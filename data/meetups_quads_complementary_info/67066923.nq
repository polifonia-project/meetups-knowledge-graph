He started his musical career posting cover videos on his YouTube channel in 2015, and gained a following in 2018. In 2019, Maro caught the attention of tech-music label SNAFU Records, which led to him signing a deal as an original pop artist. Maro's debut single \"Carsick\" was produced by Carl Falk and Albin Nedler, and released in August 2020, followed by \"Take It Back\", released in January 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maro_(singer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julio_Argentino_Roca> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz (July 17, 1843 â€“ October 19, 1914) was an army general and statesman who served as President of Argentina from 1880 to 1886 and from 1898 to 1904. Roca is the most important representative of the Generation of '80 and is known for directing the Conquest of the Desert, a series of military campaigns against the indigenous peoples of Patagonia sometimes considered a genocide. During his two terms as president, many important changes occurred, particularly major infrastructure projects of railroads and port facilities; increased foreign investment, along with immigration from Europe; large-scale immigration from southern Europe; expansion of the agricultural and pastoral sectors of the economy; and laicizing legislation strengthening state power. Roca's main foreign policy concern was to set the limits with Chile, which had never been determined with precision. In 1881 Argentina gained territory by treaty with Chile." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julio_Argentino_Roca> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hicks_(pianist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Josephus Hicks Jr. (December 21, 1941 â€“ May 10, 2006) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger. He was leader of more than 30 recordings and played as a sideman on more than 300. After early experiences backing blues musicians, Hicks moved to New York in 1963. He was part of Art Blakey's band for two years, accompanied vocalist Betty Carter from 1965 to 1967, before joining Woody Herman's big band, where he stayed until 1970. Following these associations, Hicks expanded into freer bands, including those of trumpeters Charles Tolliver and Lester Bowie. He rejoined Carter in 1975; the five-year stay brought him more attention and helped to launch his recording career as a leader. He continued to play and record extensively in the United States and internationally. Under his own leadership, his recordings were mostly bebop-influenced, while those for other leaders continued to be in a diversity of styles, including multi-year associations with saxophonists Arthur Blythe, David Murray, David \"Fathead\" Newman, and Pharoah Sanders." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hicks_(pianist)> .

Born in the south Vojvodina village of Brestač, he rose to prominence as the winner of the fourth season of the televised singing contest Zvezde Granda in 2009. His debut album was released the same year under Grand Production. Between 2014 and 2019, Lazić was married to singer and fellow-Zvezde Granda contestant Ana Sević, with whom he has a daughter. His former fiancé, Marina Gagić, also gave birth to his son. Over the years, Lazić has received substantial media coverage for his problematic lifestyle. In October 2018, Lazić had a severe traffic accident, due to driving under influence 100 km per hour and not having his seatbelt on. Although committing several traffic offences, he didn't face any legal consequences. Same year, a video of Lazić consuming cocaine surfaced to the public, which led to him admitting to have suffered from drug addiction." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darko_Lazić_(singer)> .

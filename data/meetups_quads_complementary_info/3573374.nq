Her music often includes a strong social consciousness and political statements. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described her as \"one of the most enigmatic and expressive, yet underrated singers Australia has ever produced... Always able to adapt her emotional and dramatic voice to suit a range of moods and styles.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeannie_Lewis> .

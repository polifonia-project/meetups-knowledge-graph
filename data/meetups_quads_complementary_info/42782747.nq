<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Ilfman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Haim Frank Ilfman (Hebrew: חיים פרנק אילפמן; born March 18, 1970) is an Israeli award-winning composer. He studied trombone and piano at the Jaffa Conservatorium of Music in Tel Aviv and as a young teenager was playing lead trombone with the Tel Aviv Dixieland Band. He was eventually asked to leave the conservatorium for truancy. In 1984, during a visit to Berlin, Ilfman was introduced to German composer Klaus Doldinger, at that time was scoring The NeverEnding Story. A visit to the film’s recording sessions had a powerful impact on Ilfman, who henceforth committed himself to composing for films. He has scored more than forty films and numerous television shows, as well as the fanfare for Legendary Entertainment." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Ilfman> .

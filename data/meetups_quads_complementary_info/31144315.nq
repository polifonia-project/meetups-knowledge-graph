His career began in the late 1980s, and has continued until the present. As a beatmaker, who has also rapped, Peace 586 is best known for expressing his Christian faith. He has made a mark with his signature, sample-based production style and down-to-earth lyrical content. His name is derived from the month and year that he became a Christian: May 1986." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_586> .

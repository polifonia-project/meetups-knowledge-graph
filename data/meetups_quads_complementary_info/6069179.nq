<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myles_Goodwyn> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Myles Francis Goodwyn (born Miles Francis Goodwin on June 23, 1948) is a Canadian musician and songwriter. He is the only original remaining member of the rock band April Wine, in which he is the lead vocalist, principal songwriter and guitarist. Goodwyn has led the band from its inception and modest garage band roots to multi-platinum sales and peak. Goodwyn has appeared and performed on every April Wine album. Following the band's peak during the 1970s and early '80s, Goodwyn disbanded April Wine and pursued a solo career. After a brief relocation to the Bahamas, Goodwyn returned to Canada and reformed April Wine in 1992. He continues to lead the band to the present day. In 2002, Goodwyn was the recipient of the National Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards held in Toronto. In January 2003, he received an ECMA Lifetime Achievement Award for his impact on the music industry of Atlantic Canada. In March 2008, Goodwyn stated in an interview that he had been back in the studio recording his second solo effort Myles Goodwyn & Friends of the Blues. This will be an all-blues album featuring guest performers such as Amos Garrett, David Wilcox, Frank Marino, Kenny \"Blues Boss\" Wayne and Rick Derringer. In 2016, his autobiography, Just Between You and Me, was released. In 2018, his second album Myles Goodwyn and Friends of the Blues was released." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myles_Goodwyn> .

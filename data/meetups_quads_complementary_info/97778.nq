<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slash_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Saul Hudson (born July 23, 1965), better known as Slash, is a British-American musician who is best known as the lead guitarist of the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, with whom he achieved worldwide success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Slash has received critical acclaim and is considered one of the greatest guitarists in history. Born in Hampstead, London, Slash moved to Los Angeles with his father when he was five years old. His parents were both active in the entertainment industry; he was given the nickname \"Slash\" as a child by actor Seymour Cassel. In 1983 he joined the glam metal band Hollywood Rose, then in 1985 he joined Guns N' Roses (which was composed of former members of Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns), replacing founding member Tracii Guns. In 1994, amid growing tensions within Guns N' Roses, Slash formed the supergroup Slash's Snakepit, and in 1996 he left Guns N' Roses. In 2002, he co-founded the supergroup Velvet Revolver with vocalist Scott Weiland, which re-established Slash as a mainstream performer in the mid to late 2000s. Slash has released five solo albums: Slash (2010), Apocalyptic Love (2012), World on Fire (2014), Living the Dream (2018) and 4 (2022). All but the first of these were billed to \"Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators\". Slash returned to Guns N' Roses in 2016. Time magazine named him runner-up (to Jimi Hendrix) on their list of \"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\" in 2009, while Rolling Stone placed him at number 65 on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2011. Guitar World ranked his guitar solo in \"November Rain\" number 6 on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Solos\" in 2008, and Total Guitar placed his riff in \"Sweet Child o' Mine\" at number 1 on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Riffs\" in 2004. Gibson Guitar Corporation ranked Slash as number 34 on their \"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\", while their readers landed him number 9 on Gibson's \"Top 25 Guitarists of All Time\". In 2012, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N' Roses' classic lineup." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slash_(musician)> .

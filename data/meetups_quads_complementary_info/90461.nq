<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edwin_Lutyens> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens OM KCIE PRA FRIBA (/ˈlʌtjənz/ LUT-yənz; 29 March 1869 – 1 January 1944) was an English architect known for imaginatively adapting traditional architectural styles to the requirements of his era. He designed many English country houses, war memorials and public buildings. In his biography, the writer Christopher Hussey wrote, \"In his lifetime (Lutyens) was widely held to be our greatest architect since Wren if not, as many maintained, his superior\". The architectural historian Gavin Stamp described him as \"surely the greatest British architect of the twentieth (or of any other) century\". Lutyens played an instrumental role in designing and building New Delhi, which would later on serve as the seat of the Government of India. In recognition of his contribution, New Delhi is also known as \"Lutyens' Delhi\". In collaboration with Sir Herbert Baker, he was also the main architect of several monuments in New Delhi such as the India Gate; he also designed Viceroy's House, which is now known as the Rashtrapati Bhavan.Many of his works were inspired by Indian architecture. He was elected Master of the Art Workers' Guild in 1933." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edwin_Lutyens> .

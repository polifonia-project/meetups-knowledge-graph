September 20, 1890 â€“ July 10, 1941), known professionally as Jelly Roll Morton, was an American ragtime and jazz pianist, bandleader, and composer. Morton was jazz's first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential characteristics when notated. His composition \"Jelly Roll Blues\", published in 1915, was one of the first published jazz compositions. He also claimed to have invented the genre. Morton also wrote \"King Porter Stomp\", \"Wolverine Blues\", \"Black Bottom Stomp\", and \"I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say\", the last being a tribute to New Orleans musicians from the turn of the 20th century. Morton's claim to have invented jazz in 1902 was criticized. Music critic Scott Yanow wrote, \"Jelly Roll Morton did himself a lot of harm posthumously by exaggerating his worth...Morton's accomplishments as an early innovator are so vast that he did not really need to stretch the truth.\" Gunther Schuller says of Morton's \"hyperbolic assertions\" that there is \"no proof to the contrary\" and that Morton's \"considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jelly_Roll_Morton> .

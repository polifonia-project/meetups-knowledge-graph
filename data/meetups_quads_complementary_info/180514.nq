<http://dbpedia.org/resource/MC_Solaar> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Claude M'Barali, professionally known as MC Solaar (French pronunciation: ​[ɛm si sɔˈlaʁ]; born 5 March 1969), is a French rapper of Senegalese and Chadian origin. He is one of France's most famous and influential hip hop artists. Some consider him the best French rapper of all time. MC Solaar is known for his complex lyrics and distinctive flows, which rely on word play, lyricism, and inquiry. In the English-speaking world, Solaar was signed by London-based acid jazz record label Talkin' Loud and recorded with British group Urban Species and rapper Guru, who was a member of New York-based rap group Gang Starr. Solaar has released eight studio albums and one live album. His eighth studio album, Géopoétique, produced by Alain Etchart and mixed by sound engineer David Gnozzi, won best album of the year at the Victoires de la Musique awards in 2018." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/MC_Solaar> .

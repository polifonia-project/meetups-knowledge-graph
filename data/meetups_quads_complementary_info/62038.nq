<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man_Ray> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Man Ray (born Emmanuel Radnitzky; August 27, 1890 â€“ November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of media but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his pioneering photography, and was a renowned fashion and portrait photographer. He is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called \"rayographs\" in reference to himself." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man_Ray> .

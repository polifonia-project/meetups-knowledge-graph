<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar_Gabriel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Lewis Jones (October 12, 1925 â€“ April 2, 1996), known as both Guitar Gabriel and Nyles Jones, was an American blues musician. Gabriel's unique style of guitar playing, which he referred to as \"Toot Blues\", combined Piedmont, Chicago, and Texas blues, as well as gospel, and was influenced by artists such as Blind Boy Fuller and Reverend Gary Davis. After hearing of Guitar Gabriel from the late Greensboro, North Carolina blues guitarist and pianist, James \"Guitar Slim\" Stephens, musician and folklorist Tim Duffy located and befriended Gabriel, who was the inspiration for the creation of the Music Maker Relief Foundation. Gabriel wore a trademark white sheepskin hat, which he acquired while traveling and performing with Medicine Shows during his late 20s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guitar_Gabriel> .

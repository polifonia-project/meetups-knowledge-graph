Born in the Brooklyn area, Fisher began his involvement with construction in his teen years. He then played a role in the New York real estate community for years while also serving as a major philanthropic benefactor for the men and women in the United States Armed Forces and their families, as well as helping out with numerous other not-for-profit organizations. Then President Bill Clinton awarded Fisher the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998. Fisher founded the Fisher House Foundation, which builds \"homes of comfort\" at or near military and Veterans Administration hospitals. These Fisher Houses provide free temporary lodging to the families of veterans and service members who are receiving medical care. He also founded the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zachary_Fisher> .

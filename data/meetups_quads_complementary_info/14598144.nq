<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlos_%22Patato%22_Valdes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Carlos Valdés Galán (November 4, 1926 – December 4, 2007), better known as Patato, was a Cuban conga player. In 1954, he emigrated from La Habana to New York City where he continued his prolific career as a sideman for several jazz and Latin music ensembles, and occasionally as a bandleader. He contributed to the development of the tunable conga drum which revolutionized the use of the instrument in the US. His experimental descarga albums recorded for Latin Percussion are considered the counterpart to the commercial salsa boom of the 1970s. Tito Puente once called him \"the greatest conguero alive today\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlos_%22Patato%22_Valdes> .

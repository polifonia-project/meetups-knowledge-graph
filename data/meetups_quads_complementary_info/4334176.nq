Choe's work appears in a wide variety of urban culture and entertainment contexts. He has illustrated and written for magazines including Hustler, Ray Gun and Vice. He has an ongoing relationship with the Asian pop culture store-cum-magazine Giant Robot. He once hung his work in a Double Rainbow ice cream shop located on Melrose Avenue. His figurative paintings, which explore themes of desire, degradation, and exaltation, are characterized by a raw, frenetic method that he has termed \"dirty style.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Choe> .

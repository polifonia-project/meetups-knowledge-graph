<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthew_Barney> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Matthew Barney (born March 25, 1967) is an American contemporary artist and film director who works in the fields of sculpture, film, photography and drawing. His works explore connections among geography, biology, geology and mythology as well as themes of conflict and failure. His early pieces were sculptural installations combined with performance and video. Between 1994 and 2002, he created The Cremaster Cycle, a series of five films described by Jonathan Jones in The Guardian as \"one of the most imaginative and brilliant achievements in the history of avant-garde cinema.\" He is also known for his projects Drawing Restraint 9 (2005), River of Fundament (2014) and Redoubt (2018)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthew_Barney> .

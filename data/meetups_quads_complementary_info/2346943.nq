After his death a lot of women started wear saree’s again. Iqbal Bano sings Hum Dekhenge in protest, Iqbal Bano sang it to a full house at Lahore’s Alhamra Arts Council in 1985 at the Faiz Foundation annual event. Zia’s regime was in full swing, and many bans were in place, including one on sarees. The garment was deemed too Indian, and therefore anti-Islamic. Legend has it that Iqbal Bano defied the ban and turned up in a black saree to sing at the event." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iqbal_Bano> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wayne_Static> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wayne Richard Wells (November 4, 1965 â€“ November 1, 2014), known professionally as Wayne Static, was an American musician, best known as the lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and primary lyricist for metal band Static-X. He released his only solo studio album, Pighammer, on October 4, 2011. Static was recognizable for his unusual hairstyle; his hair was held up in a vertical position, a process that took about 20 minutes to complete (45 minutes, according to his mother). He was also known for his signature \"chintail\" beard." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wayne_Static> .

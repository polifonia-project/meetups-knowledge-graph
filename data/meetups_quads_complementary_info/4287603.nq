<http://dbpedia.org/resource/BA_Robertson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brian Alexander Robertson born September 12, 1956 is a Scottish musician, actor, composer and songwriter. He had a string of hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s characterised by catchy pop tunes and jaunty humorous lyrics, including \"Knocked It Off\", \"To Be or Not to Be\" and \"Bang Bang\", a tongue-in-cheek commentary on famous historical and fictional couples. He wrote with Mike Rutherford of Genesis the Grammy-nominated and Ivor Novello Award-winning \"The Living Years\". It was a number one hit in the US, Canada, Australia and Ireland and reached number 2 in his native UK. He has also written music for films and been a television presenter." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/BA_Robertson> .

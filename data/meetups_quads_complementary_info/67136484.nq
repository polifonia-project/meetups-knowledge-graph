<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Lee_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Lee (born Mary Ann McDevitt; 13 August 1921 â€“ 13 March 2022) was a Scottish singer, variety performer and broadcaster whose career spanned the 1930s to the 1990s. She achieved early recognition whilst still a teenager as a vocalist with Roy Fox's dance band, which was one of Britain's most popular in the interwar period. At the time of her death, Lee was the last surviving singer who had been active with the British dance bands in the 1930s, the heyday of their popularity. She later became known in Scottish variety through performing with her husband, comedian Jack Milroy, and presented an award-winning programme on Radio Clyde in the 1990s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Lee_(singer)> .

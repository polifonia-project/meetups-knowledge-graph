<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Callea> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anthony Cosmo Callea (born 13 December 1982) is an Australian singer-songwriter and stage actor who rose to prominence as the runner-up in the 2004 season of Australian Idol. Callea's debut single, a cover of Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's song \"The Prayer\" is the fastest-selling single by an Australian artist, held the No.1 spot on the ARIA Singles Chart for five weeks, a record for the debut single of an Australian Idol contestant, and was the second-highest selling Australian single of the last decade. Callea has accumulated a string of awards including an ARIA Music Award, Channel V Artist of the Year, Pop Republic Artist of the Year, MTV Viewers' Choice Award, Variety's Young Entertainer of the Year, MO Award and a Gospel Music Award and is known for his powerful trained voice and his versatility in a range of genres in releases and live performances. All but one of the tracks on his second album A New Chapter were co-written by him. October 2011 saw Callea release his first new music in four years, a single titled \"Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh\", self-funded, released and distributed as a fully independent venture through his own production company, Vox Enterprises. The dance-pop track was co-written in LA with two-time Grammy-nominated and official DJ for the Black Eyed Peas, Poet Name Life. It signals a departure from the ballads for which he is known and was released in digital format only. His albums, DVD and singles have all debuted in the top 20 of the ARIA Charts with the exception of \"Oh Oh Oh Oh\", an EP titled Last To Go released in February 2012 and his fourth album released in 2013. However, \"Oh Oh Oh Oh\" debuted at number 6 on the Official Independent Music Charts AIR Charts, and in its first week, peaked at number 17 on the ARIA Top 20 Australian Artists Singles Chart. Last To Go reached number 7 on the Independent Distribution Singles Chart. In March 2013, it was announced Callea signed a record deal with ABC Music and would release his third studio album on 26 April 2013. The new release, entitled Thirty, was the first of two albums released that year, and were distributed by Universal Music. The second, released on 8 November 2013 was a Christmas album titled This Is Christmas. In August 2014 Callea released his third album with ABC music but, in contrast to previous albums, this was a Live DVD/CD Ladies & Gentlemen: The Songs of George Michael filmed and recorded at the Palms at Crown Melbourne. The DVD debuted at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts. On 5 August 2016, after three albums with ABC Music, Callea announced that he had re-signed with Sony Music Australia and would be releasing his sixth album Backbone along with an East Coast tour, due to be released in September 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Callea> .

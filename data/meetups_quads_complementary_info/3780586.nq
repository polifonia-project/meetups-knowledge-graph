<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Country_Yossi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Yossi (Joseph) Toiv (born January 9, 1949), known professionally as Country Yossi, is an American Orthodox Jewish composer, singer, radio show host, author, and magazine publisher. A composer and singer in the Jewish music genre, Toiv has to his credit three albums as a member of the group Or Chodosh (\"New Light\") circa 1971â€“73, seven albums under the name Country Yossi and the Shteeble Hoppers, and a series of six albums for children called Kivi and Tuki. He also released \"Country Yossi's Classic Calls\" a humorous collection of actual on-air phone calls to his radio show. He has also released two animated Kivi and Tuki DVDs. Toiv adopted his stage name from his parodies of popular country music tunes that he reworked to convey Orthodox Jewish themes. He then transferred the name as a brand name onto the magazine, radio show, musical albums, and children's books which he has published for the mostly Orthodox Jewish market in the United States. Toiv has become famous as the composer of \"Little Kinderlach\" which was adapted as the ubiquitous Kars4Kids jingle." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Country_Yossi> .

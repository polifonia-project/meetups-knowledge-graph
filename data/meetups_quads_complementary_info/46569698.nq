<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liana_Burgess> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Liana Burgess (born Liliana Macellari, September 25, 1929 â€“ December 3, 2007) was an Italian translator and literary agent who was the second wife of English writer Anthony Burgess. Burgess and Macellari had embarked on an affair while Burgess was married to his first wife, and Macellari gave birth to a son nine months after their meeting. The couple became tax exiles in the late 1960s, living in Malta and Italy, and spent several years in the United States. They finally settled in Monaco. Macellari played an important role in Burgess's later literary career, negotiating film rights and acting as his European literary agent, and translating his novels." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liana_Burgess> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Woodyard> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sam Woodyard (January 7, 1925 â€“ September 20, 1988) was an American jazz drummer. He was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States. Woodyard was largely an autodidact on drums and played locally in the Newark, New Jersey area in the 1940s. He performed with Paul Gayten in an R&B group, then played in the early 1950s with Joe Holiday, Roy Eldridge, and Milt Buckner. In 1955, he joined Duke Ellington's orchestra and remained until 1966. After his time with Ellington, Woodyard worked with Ella Fitzgerald, then moved to Los Angeles. In the 1970s, he played less due to health problems, but he recorded with Buddy Rich, and toured with Claude Bolling. In 1983, he belonged to a band with Teddy Wilson, Buddy Tate, and Slam Stewart. His last recording was on Steve Lacy's 1988 album, The Door. He died of cancer in Paris at the age of 63." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Woodyard> .

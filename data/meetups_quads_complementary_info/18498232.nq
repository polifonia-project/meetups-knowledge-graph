He toured nationally with the Beatles, Roy Orbison, the Everly Brothers, Kenny Rogers, Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette and Charley Pride. During his career he has led various groups including Johnny Chester and The Chessmen, Johnny Chester and Jigsaw, Johnny Chester and Hotspur. With Jigsaw he had five top 30 hit singles, \"Gwen (Congratulations)\" (1971), \"Shame and Scandal\", \"Midnight Bus\" (both 1972), \"World's Greatest Mum\" (No. 9, 1973) and \"She's My Kind of Woman\" (1974).

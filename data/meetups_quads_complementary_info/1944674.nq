He established the Edge Foundation, an organization that brings together leading edge thinkers across a broad range of scientific and technical fields. Brockman was born to immigrants of Polish-Jewish descent in a poor Irish Catholic enclave of Boston, Massachusetts. Expanding on C.P. Snow's \"two cultures\", he introduced the \"third culture\" consisting of \"those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are.\" He led a scientific salon for 20 years, asking an annual question to a host of renowned scientists and publishing their answers in book form, which he decided to symbolically close down in 2018. He is an editor of Edge.org." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Brockman_(literary_agent)> .

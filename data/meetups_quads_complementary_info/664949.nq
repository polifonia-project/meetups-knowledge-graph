<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Buono> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Victor Charles Buono (February 3, 1938 – January 1, 1982) was an American actor, comic, and briefly a recording artist. He was known for playing the villain King Tut in the television series Batman (1966–1968) and musician Edwin Flagg in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), the latter of which earned him Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations. He was a busy actor from his late teens until his death at the age of 43 and, with his large size and sonorous voice, he made a career of playing men much older than he was." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Buono> .

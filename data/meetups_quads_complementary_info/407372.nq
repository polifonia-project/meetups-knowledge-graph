He had a long association with Ronnie Barker in the BBC television comedy sketch show The Two Ronnies. He achieved prominence in David Frost's 1960s satirical comedy programme The Frost Report (with Barker) and subsequently starred in sitcoms such as No – That's Me Over Here!, Now Look Here, and Sorry!. Corbett began his acting career after moving from Edinburgh to London; he had early roles in the TV series Crackerjack and The Saint, and appeared in the films You're Only Young Twice, Rockets Galore!, Casino Royale, Some Will, Some Won't, and No Sex Please, We're British. He first worked with Ronnie Barker in the BBC TV series The Frost Report in 1966, and the two of them were given their own show by the BBC five years later. The Two Ronnies ran as a comedy sketch show from 1971 to 1987, and became Corbett and Barker's most famous work; Corbett became known for his meandering chair monologues." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronnie_Corbett> .

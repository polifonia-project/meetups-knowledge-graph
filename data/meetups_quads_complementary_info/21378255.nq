A member of the Democratic Party, he was the 54th governor of New York from 2007 until his resignation in 2008. Spitzer was born in New York City, attended Princeton University, and earned his law degree from Harvard. He began his career as an attorney in private practice with New York law firms before becoming a prosecutor with the office of the New York County (Manhattan) District Attorney. From 1999 to 2006, he was the Attorney General of New York, earning a reputation as the \"Sheriff of Wall Street\" for his efforts to curb corruption in the financial services industry. Spitzer was elected Governor of New York in 2006 by the largest margin of any candidate, but his tenure lasted less than two years after it was uncovered he patronized a prostitution ring. He resigned immediately following the scandal, and his lieutenant governor, David Paterson, served the rest of his term. Since leaving the governorship, Spitzer worked as a television host and an adjunct instructor at City College of New York, along with engaging in real estate activity and making private investments in a start-up company. He ran for New York City Comptroller in 2013, losing the Democratic nomination to the eventual winner, Scott Stringer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eliot_Spitzer> .

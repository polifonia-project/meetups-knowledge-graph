He is one of the Philippines' most esteemed choral conductors. He is also a composer, singer, arranger, choral clinician, writer, producer, music minister, author, and book editor. Navarro is more popularly known as the former conductor of the Ateneo de Manila College Glee Club. Under his direction, the group gave acclaimed performances in international events, won top prizes in prestigious international choral competitions, and participated in the 2001 European Grand Prix for Choral Singing. He specializes in 20th and 21st century choral music, but is equally comfortable and adept in music of many epochs. An active performer of music from different eras and ethnic traditions, he takes an ardent interest in post-modern music, Southeast Asian music traditions, and global hymnody." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_P._Navarro> .

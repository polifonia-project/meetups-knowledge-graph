<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elvin_Bishop> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Elvin Richard Bishop (born October 21, 1942) is an American blues and rock music singer, guitarist, bandleader, and songwriter. An original member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of that group in 2015 and the Blues Hall of Fame in his own right in 2016. Bishop feels that the limitations of his voice have helped his songwriting." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elvin_Bishop> .

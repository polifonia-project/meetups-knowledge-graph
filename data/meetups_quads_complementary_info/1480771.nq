Signed to Asylum Records in 1994 at age 20, White released his self-titled debut album that year. Both it and its follow-up, 1996's Between Now and Forever, were certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and 1997's The Right Place was certified gold. His fourth album, 1999's How Lucky I Am, produced two top 40 singles, with the song \"God Gave Me You\" eventually becoming a big hit in the Philippines. White has charted 17 singles on the Billboard country charts, of which four reached number one: \"Someone Else's Star\" in 1995, \"Rebecca Lynn\" and \"So Much for Pretending\" in 1996, and \"Sittin' on Go\" in 1997. \"So Much for Pretending\" was the most successful of these songs, spending two weeks at number one." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bryan_White> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bert_Gordon_(comedian)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bert Gordon (April 8, 1895 â€“ November 30, 1974) was an American comedian and voice actor who appeared in vaudeville, radio, and occasionally films. Gordon was born Barney Gorodetsky. He appeared in many roles over his lengthy career and was known by the moniker \"The Mad Russian\". He was a regular on The Eddie Cantor Program, and also appeared on The Jack Benny Program, and The Abbott and Costello Program. In 1945 he starred in his own film vehicle, How Doooo You Do!!!, directed by Ralph Murphy; the film takes its title from Gordon's distinctive way of introducing himself, which became a catch phrase in the early 1940s. Gordon played himself in an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show in 1964 along with several other radio-era performers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bert_Gordon_(comedian)> .

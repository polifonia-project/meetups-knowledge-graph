<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clark_Clifford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clark McAdams Clifford (December 25, 1906 – October 10, 1998) was an American lawyer who served as an important political adviser to Democratic presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. His official government positions were White House Counsel (1946–1950), Chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board (1963–1968), and Secretary of Defense (1968–1969); Clifford was also influential in his role as an unofficial, informal presidential adviser in various issues. A successful Washington lawyer, he was known for his elite clientele, charming manners, and impeccable suits. All four Democratic presidents of the Cold War era employed Clifford's services and relied on his counsel, marking him as one of the ultimate Washington insiders. Emblematic of Clifford's influence in postwar Democratic presidential administrations was the fact that after Jimmy Carter won the 1976 presidential election, his transition team was adamant that Clifford, as a symbol of the DC establishment, should not have any influence whatsoever, declaring that \"if you ever see us relying on Clark Clifford, you'll know we have failed\", yet Carter eventually came to rely on him nonetheless. In his later years, Clifford became involved in several controversies. He was a key figure in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal, which led to a grand jury indictment." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clark_Clifford> .

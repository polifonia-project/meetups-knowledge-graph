<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ithaka_(artist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ithaka Darin Pappas (born July 8, 1966), known professionally as Ithaka, is an American-born multidisciplinary artist of Greek ancestry who creates using music, sculpture and photography (both as separate entities or using them in combination with each other). He has published short stories in international magazines and periodicals, which have sometimes been the basis for his travel-oriented lyrical content. In a 2005 article for the magazine Waves, journalist Ricardo Macario described Ithaka as The Miscellaneous Man. In a 2008 review of Ithaka's 6th album, Saltwater Nomad, the online surf-culture platform Surfline stated that; the artist effortlessly traverses at ease between all of his choses mediums of expression [music, sculpture, writing and photography], and that, his life's journey is a soulful balancing act somewhere between the worlds of euphoric creation and aquatic diversion." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ithaka_(artist)> .

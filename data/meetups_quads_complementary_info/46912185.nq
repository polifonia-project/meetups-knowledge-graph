He is the founder of the Nouveau Riche record label, which includes popular Dutch artists Mr. Polska and Jebroer. Boaz has helped launch the careers of many artists under his label, as well as his frequent collaborator Ronnie Flex and DJ trio Yellow Claw. Since 2013, Boaz has transitioned from mainly producing Dutch hip hop songs to releasing electronic music as a lead artist – he has released two EPs under the American dance label Mad Decent. Boaz is also affiliated with producer Diplo, with whom he contributes to the DJ group Major Lazer. Boaz is known for his unique musical style of creating \"insane rap songs that would span four–five genres in about three and a half minutes.\" His songs incorporate elements of dance. Boaz received the Dutch State Award for \"best producer\" for three years in a row between 2011 and 2013. He has produced for artists such as Yellow Claw, Diplo, Major Lazer, Jack Ü, The Partysquad, Madonna, Ariana Grande, Pharrell Williams and Sean Paul, among others." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boaz_van_de_Beatz> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Safran> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Michael Safran (Hebrew: יְהוֹשֻׁעַ ספרן, Yehoshua Safran; born 13 August 1972) is an Australian radio personality, satirist, documentary maker and author, known for combining humour with religious, political and ethnic issues. First gaining fame appearing in Race Around the World in 1997, Safran went on to produce a series of documentaries, television shows and host radio programs. Safran is known for his television stunts, which include placing a fatwa on Australian television host Rove McManus, sneaking nine young men into an exclusive Melbourne nightclub by disguising them as members of American nu metal band Slipknot, running through Jerusalem wearing nothing but the beanie and scarf of St Kilda Football Club, driving a remote-controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and his confrontation with A Current Affair host Ray Martin. Currently, he works as a journalist; he released his latest book, Puff Piece, in August 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Safran> .

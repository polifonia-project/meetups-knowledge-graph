<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stan_Brakhage> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Stanley Brakhage (/ˈbrækɪdʒ/ BRAK-ij; January 14, 1933 – March 9, 2003) was an American filmmaker. He is considered to be one of the most important figures in 20th-century experimental film. Over the course of five decades, Brakhage created a large and diverse body of work, exploring a variety of formats, approaches and techniques that included handheld camerawork, painting directly onto celluloid, fast cutting, in-camera editing, scratching on film, collage film and the use of multiple exposures. Interested in mythology and inspired by music, poetry, and visual phenomena, Brakhage sought to reveal the universal, in particular exploring themes of birth, mortality, sexuality, and innocence. His films are for the most part silent. Brakhage's films are often noted for their expressiveness and lyricism. While they were for many years obscure and hard to find, many are now readily available on DVD as well as other media." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stan_Brakhage> .

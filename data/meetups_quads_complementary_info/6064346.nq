<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cory_Monteith> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Cory Allan Michael Monteith (/mɒnˈtiːθ/; May 11, 1982 – July 13, 2013) was a Canadian actor and musician who played Finn Hudson on the Fox television series Glee. As an actor based in British Columbia, Monteith had minor roles on television series before being cast on Glee. During his success on the show, he also acted in films. His film work included Monte Carlo and a starring role in Sisters & Brothers (both 2011). Monteith had a troubled adolescence involving substance abuse from age 13, and left school at age 16. After an intervention by family and friends, he entered drug rehabilitation at age 19. In a 2011 interview with Parade magazine, he discussed his history of substance abuse as a teen, and in March 2013, he again sought treatment for addiction. On July 13, 2013, he died of a toxic combination of heroin and alcohol in a Vancouver hotel room." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cory_Monteith> .

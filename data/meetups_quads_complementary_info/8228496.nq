<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irwin_Bazelon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Irwin Bazelon (June 4, 1922 in Evanston, Illinois â€“ August 2, 1995) was an American composer of contemporary classical music. Contemporary American composer Irwin Bazelon's music is known for its interesting rhythms and its emphasis on the brass and percussion sections. In total, Bazelon composed nine symphonies and over sixty orchestral, chamber, and instrumental works. Some of his most famous works are Short Symphony, Churchill Downs, and Propulsions, which is written for 113 percussion instruments to be played by seven performers. His music is recorded on Composers Recordings, Inc. and on Albany Records. Artists who recorded his music include conductors Harold Farberman and Gianmaria Griglio, soprano Nancy Allen Lundy, pianist Scott Dunn, and percussionists William Moersch, Eliseo Rael, and William Klymus. Bazelon's music lacks any regular pulse, instead it is characterized by unpredictable syncopation, irregular groupings, unexpected triplets, and off-beat accents. His theme music for NBC News opened the show from 1962 to 1977.[1]." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irwin_Bazelon> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poppy_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Moriah Rose Pereira (born January 1, 1995), known professionally as Poppy and formerly as That Poppy, is an American singer, songwriter, YouTuber, and performance artist. In 2014, she gained viral fame by starring in performance art videos on YouTube as an uncanny valley-like android who commented on and satirised internet culture and modern society. She signed a recording contract with Island Records in 2015 and released her debut pop EP Bubblebath in 2016. In 2017, Poppy signed a deal with Mad Decent and released her debut studio album Poppy.Computer, which consisted of art pop and bubblegum pop songs. To promote the album, she embarked on the Poppy.Computer Tour. In 2018, she released the pilot for the proposed surreal comedy online series I'm Poppy on YouTube Premium. She also released her second studio album Am I a Girl? In stark contrast to her previous style, the second half of Am I a Girl? began to show a heavy nu metal influence. In 2020, Poppy signed to Sumerian Records and released her third studio album I Disagree, incorporating heavy metal and industrial rock. Continuing the stylistic shift that started with her second album, I Disagree featured lyrical themes and music videos which some critics described as \"disturbing\", \"violent\", and \"macabre\". In 2021, as part of her long-time collaboration with professional wrestling promotion WWE and its NXT brand, she released the metalcore EP Eat (NXT Soundtrack). Her fourth studio album, Flux, was released three months later to critical acclaim and featured a less harsh and more stripped-down sound than her previous works. Poppy's song \"Bloodmoney\" received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2021, making her the first and currently only female artist to be nominated in a metal category." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poppy_(entertainer)> .

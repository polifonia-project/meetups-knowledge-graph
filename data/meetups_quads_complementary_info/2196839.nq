<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Allen_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tony Oladipo Allen (20 July 1940 â€“ 30 April 2020) was a Nigerian drummer, composer, and songwriter who lived and worked in Paris, France. Allen was the drummer and musical director of Fela Kuti's band Africa '70 from 1968 to 1979, and was one of the founders of the Afrobeat genre. Fela once stated that \"without Tony Allen, there would be no Afrobeat\". He was described by Brian Eno as \"perhaps the greatest drummer who has ever lived\". Later in life, Allen collaborated with Damon Albarn on several projects, including Gorillaz, the Good, the Bad & the Queen and Rocket Juice & the Moon. Allen's career and life were documented in his 2013 autobiography Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat, co-written with Michael E. Veal, who previously wrote a comprehensive biography of Fela Kuti." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Allen_(musician)> .

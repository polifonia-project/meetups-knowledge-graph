She was shot and killed by police officers called by family members who could not wake her as she lay unconscious in a car with a gun on her lap. The incident sparked demonstrations against police anti-blackness. The officers involved were fired from Riverside Police Department but did not face prosecution due to insufficient evidence, and were later afforded full back-pay after the decision to terminate their employment was found to be an \"abuse of administrative discretion,\" though they were not reinstated." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyisha_Miller> .

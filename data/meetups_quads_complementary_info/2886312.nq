<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elayne_Boosler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Elayne Boosler (born August 18, 1952) is an American comedian, writer and actor. She was one of the few women working in stand-up comedy in the 1970s and 80s and she broke ground by adopting an observational style, that included frank discussions about her life as a single woman, as well as political commentary. Her 1985, self-produced comedy special Party of One was the first hour-long comedy special by a female comedian to appear on a cable television network. Comedian Richard Lewis told The New York Times in 1984: \"She is the Jackie Robinson of my generation. She is the strongest female working. She broke the mold for most female comics.\" Rolling Stone referred to her as \"The First Lady of Stand-Up\" in 1988 and included Boosler in their list of the \"50 Best Stand-Up Comics of All Time\" in 2017. In 2018, CNN included Boosler in their list of \"Groundbreaking women in American comedy\" and critic Jason Zinoman of The New York Times referred to Boosler as \"The Comedy Master Who Hasnâ€™t Gotten Her Due.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elayne_Boosler> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edgar_Kennedy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edgar Livingston Kennedy (April 26, 1890 â€“ November 9, 1948) was an American comedic character actor who appeared in at least 500 films during the silent and sound eras. Professionally, he was known as \"Slow Burn\", owing to his ability to portray characters whose anger slowly rose in frustrating situations. In many of his roles, he used exasperated facial expressions and performed very deliberately to convey his rising anger or \"burn\", often rubbing his hand over his bald head and across his face in an effort to control his temper. One memorable example of his comedy technique can be seen in the 1933 Marx Brothers' film Duck Soup, where he plays a sidewalk lemonade vendor who is harassed and increasingly provoked by Harpo and Chico." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edgar_Kennedy> .

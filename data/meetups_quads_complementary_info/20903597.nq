<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Walker_(guitarist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Walker is an American folk guitarist noted for virtuosic performances fusing the Indian classical and Spanish flamenco traditions. Walker was recognized principally for his recorded output in the mid-to-late sixties. His status has risen following his rediscovery by younger generations of American and European outsider folk artists. Today, he is placed among the ranks of notable American finger-pickers Sandy Bull, John Fahey, Robbie Basho and Leo Kottke. This new esteem has granted him a renewed platform for both touring and recording." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Walker_(guitarist)> .

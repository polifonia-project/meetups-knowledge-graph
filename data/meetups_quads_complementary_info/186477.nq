<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Rogers> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roy Rogers (born Leonard Franklin Slye; November 5, 1911 â€“ July 6, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and television host. Following early work under his given name, first as co-founder of the Sons of the Pioneers and then acting, the rebranded Rogers then became one of the most popular Western stars of his era. Known as the \"King of the Cowboys\", he appeared in over 100 films and numerous radio and television episodes of The Roy Rogers Show. In many of his films and television episodes, he appeared with his wife, Dale Evans; his Golden Palomino, Trigger; and his German Shepherd, Bullet. His show was broadcast on radio for nine years and then on television from 1951 through 1957. His early roles were uncredited parts in films by fellow cowboy singing star Gene Autry and his productions usually featured a sidekick, often Pat Brady, Andy Devine, George \"Gabby\" Hayes, or Smiley Burnette. In his later years, he lent his name to the franchise chain of Roy Rogers Restaurants." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Rogers> .

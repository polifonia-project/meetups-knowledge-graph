<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oscar_Harris> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Oscar Harris (born 30 November 1943) is a Surinamese singer. He was among the best known Surinamese musicians in the Netherlands during the 1970s and 1980s. Harris moved to Amsterdam to study architecture in 1963, and founded Oscar Harris and The Twinkle Stars, a ten-man vocal and instrumental group in 1965, which became known by playing at student gatherings in Amsterdam. In 1968 the group was signed to the artist roster of Omega Records and Blue Elephant, with a tour of South America in 1971. In 1974, Harris went solo with the single \"Alta Gracia\", commencing a series of hit-singles up to 1988. He had also recorded some hits in Indonesia, including \"Sandy\" and \"Oh Tuhan\". In 2015 TopNotch released a compilation CD in the Sranan Gowtu-series (Surinamese Gold) devoted to Surinamese artists, mainly from the 1970s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oscar_Harris> .

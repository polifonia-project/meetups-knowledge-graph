He is best known for being a member of the Jackson family. From 1964 to 1975, Jermaine was second vocalist after his brother Michael of The Jackson 5, and played bass guitar. Since 1983 he rejoined the group, now known as The Jacksons. Jermaine sang the lead on some of The Jackson Five's biggest hits,and featured in \"I'll Be There\" and \"I Want You Back\" amongst others. When the four others left and had to reform as The Jacksons, Jermaine, who had just married Motown founder Berry Gordy's daughter Hazel, stayed at Motown and was replaced by his youngest brother, Randy. Jermaine had a solo career concurrent with his brother Michael's and some top-30 hits until the 1980s, produced and recorded duets with Whitney Houston at her debut in 1985, and was a producer for the band Switch. After seven years he rejoined The Jacksons and remained throughout their various breakups and reunions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jermaine_Jackson> .

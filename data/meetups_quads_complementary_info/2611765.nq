<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Corbin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Henry Corbin (14 April 1903 – 7 October 1978) was a French philosopher, theologian, and Iranologist. He was professor of Islamic studies at the École pratique des hautes études in Paris. A seminal figure in the modern study of traditional Islamic philosophy, he shifted attention from early falsafa to later and \"mystical\" figures such as Suhrawardi, Ibn Arabi, and Mulla Sadra Shirazi. Corbin was born in Paris in April 1903. Although Protestant by birth, he received a Catholic education and obtained a certificate in Scholastic philosophy from the Catholic Institute of Paris at age 19. Three years later he took his \"license de philosophie\" under the Thomist Étienne Gilson. He also studied modern philosophy, including phenomenology, and became the first French translator of Martin Heidegger. In 1928 he encountered Louis Massignon, director of Islamic studies at the Sorbonne, who introduced him to Suhrawardi, the 12th-century Persian Muslim thinker. This made him deeply interested in Iranian Islam, which he believed esoterically expressed older perennial elements related to Zoroastrianism and Platonism. Years later, Corbin said: \"through my meeting with Suhrawardi, my spiritual destiny for the passage through this world was sealed. Platonism, expressed in terms of the Zoroastrian angelology of ancient Persia, illuminated the path that I was seeking.\" He spent time in Iran, working with Shia thinkers such as Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai and Hossein Nasr. He developed a unique hermeneutic reading of Islamic philosophy, which sought to take its transformative religious dimensions seriously. Corbin also applied this interpretation to Christianity in his works on Swedenborg and the Holy Grail. Further, he was a prominent member of the Eranos circle of scholars initiated by Carl Jung. His general work Histoire de la philosophie islamique (1964) decisively challenged the common European view that philosophy in the Islamic world declined after Ibn Rushd." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Corbin> .

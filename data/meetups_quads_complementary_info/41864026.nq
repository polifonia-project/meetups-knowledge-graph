According to John Leland of the New York Times \"Mr. Aaron played flute, saxophone, clarinet and piano, then taught himself guitar, trumpet, bassoon, French horn and other instruments.\" He performed for rapper Wyclef Jean's band from 1998 to 2008. Robin Caulden of Press-Republican said \"He's played with everybody â€” Afrika Bambataa, B52s, Blondie, Chic, David Bowie, Heavy D, James Chance and The Contortions, RZA, Stetsasonic, William Vivanco and Wu-Tang Clan.\" In 1981, he first started work with James Chance for the group James White and the Blacks; and has toured with him since in Europe and Japan.He played sax on David Bowie's 1983 hit \"Let's Dance\". In 2010, Aaron released his album Trouble Man, which Michael Daly of the Daily Beast called \"artistically adventurous but commercially unsuccessful\".Folk singer Eric Andersen, who used Aaron on several albums as a producer and performer, said \"He is telepathic as a musician. He was completely dedicated and loyal to the job. Absolutely dedicated. He lived for his art. He personifies a cool that transcends the hot temperaments.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Aaron> .

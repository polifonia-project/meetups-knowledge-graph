<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beth_Tweddle> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Elizabeth Kimberly Tweddle MBE (born 1 April 1985) is a retired British artistic gymnast. Renowned for her uneven bar and floor routines, she was the first female gymnast from Great Britain to win a medal at the European Championships, World Championships, and Olympic Games. Tweddle, known for her consistency and longevity as an elite gymnast, is regarded as a pioneer of the renaissance of British gymnastics at the beginning of the twenty-first century that saw the country's gymnastics programme progress from 'also ran' to consistent global competitiveness. Tweddle represented Great Britain at three Olympic Games. She is the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist on uneven bars, the 2006 and 2010 World Champion on the uneven bars, the 2009 World Champion on floor exercise, a four-time European Champion on the uneven bars, and a two-time European Champion on the floor exercise. Tweddle retired in August 2013. Following retirement, Tweddle took on a variety of media and sporting work. On 10 March 2013, she won the eighth series of Dancing on Ice along with Daniel Whiston, who won the show for the third time. In 2014, she took part in the ninth and (at the time) last series of Dancing on Ice, the \"All-Stars\" series, with her new skating partner Łukasz Różycki, making the final and coming third. In 2016, Tweddle participated in the third series of Channel 4 reality contest show The Jump. However, on 7 February, two weeks into the show, Tweddle suffered a back injury and withdrew. It was reported on 8 February 2016 that she had undergone successful surgery to fuse two vertebrae." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beth_Tweddle> .

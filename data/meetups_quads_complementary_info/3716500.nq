He is best known for his time on Ruff Ryders, through whom he released his debut album, Opposite of H2O (2000). The album was successful, debuting at number five on the US Billboard 200 chart and eventually sold over 500,000 copies and earning a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After leaving Interscope Records, which issued his debut alongside Ruff Ryders, Drag-On joined Virgin Records and released his second album Hell and Back, in 2004. Drag-On has appeared in the 2001 film Exit Wounds and the 2003 Cradle 2 the Grave, both of which stars his then-Ruff Ryders label-mate DMX." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drag-On> .

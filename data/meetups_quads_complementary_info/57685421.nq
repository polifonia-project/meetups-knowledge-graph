<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margaret_Harrison_(violinist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Margaret Harrison (1899–1995) was an English violinist and the youngest of four sisters who were respected classical musicians in Great Britain during the early 20th century. Each had started out as child prodigies. Her sisters, May (1890-1959), Beatrice (1892-1965), and Monica (1897-1983), became, respectively, a violinist, a cellist, and a mezzo-soprano. All four were reportedly also talented pianists. Her eldest sister, May Harrison, became known for her interpretations of the violin works of Bach, Brahms and Delius while her sister, Beatrice, was praised by King George V for her outdoor recordings at the Harrison’s home at Foyle Riding in Oxted, Surrey of cello works mingled with nightingale songs. According to Katrina Fountain who wrote a biographical sketch of the Harrison sisters: However much we admire the soloists of today, things will never be the same as during the lifetime of the Harrison family. They dedicated their lives to the cause of music, paving the way for a generation of women musicians. They gained the respect of the leading composers and performers of their day and set a musical precedent in the history of English music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margaret_Harrison_(violinist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andy_Bell_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Andrew Ivan Bell (born 25 April 1964) is an English singer-songwriter and lead singer of the synth-pop duo Erasure. The band achieved mainstream success (receiving a Brit Award for Best British Group) and are popular within the LGBT community, for whom the openly gay Bell has become an icon. Erasure have penned over 200 songs and have sold over 25 million albums worldwide. They have achieved five consecutive number ones on the UK Albums Chart. Hit singles include \"A Little Respect\", \"Sometimes\" and \"Always\". Bell is known for his soulful voice and flamboyant stage persona, which contrast with bandmate Vince Clarke's low-key, deadpan demeanour. His solo career includes the studio albums Electric Blue (2005), Non-Stop (2010), and iPop (2014)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andy_Bell_(singer)> .

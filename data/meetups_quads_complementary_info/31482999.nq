Edwards began his career with Aston Villa and then Bristol City, where he rose through the youth ranks to graduate from the club's academy. He made his professional debut for the club in February 2011 following a loan spell at Conference Premier side Bath City. He was again loaned out in the 2011–12 season to Stockport County and Yeovil Town. Following a second loan spell with Yeovil in the 2012–13 season, he joined the club permanently in January 2013. He helped the club reach the Championship for the first time in their history, but suffered relegation after just one season. He was appointed captain for the 2014–15 season, but the club were relegated for the second season in succession. Following their relegation to League Two, he joined League One side Colchester United. Edwards went on to spend three seasons at Walsall, a spell which came to an end following his release and the Saddlers' relegation in 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Edwards_(footballer,_born_1990)> .

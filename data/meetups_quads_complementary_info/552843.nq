<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Hoddle> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Glenn Hoddle (born 27 October 1957) is an English former football player and manager. He currently works as a television pundit and commentator for ITV Sport and BT Sport. He played as a midfielder for Tottenham Hotspur, Monaco, Chelsea and Swindon Town and at international level for England. In 2007, he was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame, which cited him as one of the most gifted and creative English footballers of his generation, exhibiting \"sublime balance and close control, unrivalled passing and vision and extraordinary shooting ability, both from open play and set pieces\". He was also known for his tactical intelligence and work-rate. He has been manager of Swindon Town (earning promotion to the Premier League), Chelsea (taking them to the FA Cup final), Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur (reaching a League Cup final) and Wolverhampton Wanderers. He managed England to the second round of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to Argentina on penalties. He was dismissed from the England job in 1999 for a newspaper interview in which he was widely interpreted as saying that people with disabilities and others are affected by karma from past lives. He said that his words were \"misconstrued, misunderstood and misinterpreted\" and that disabled people had his \"overwhelming support, care, consideration and dedication\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Hoddle> .

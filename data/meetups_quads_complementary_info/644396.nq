<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_De_Vit> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Antony de Vit (/dəˈviː/ də-VEE; 12 September 1957 – 2 July 1998) was an English DJ and music producer. He is considered one of the most influential of his generation. He was credited with helping to take the \"hard house\" and fast \"hard NRG\" sounds out of the London and Birmingham gay scene into mainstream clubs. His single \"Burning Up\" reached number 25 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1995, with \"To The Limit\" making number 44 in September 1995. During that year he won BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix of the Year Award, as voted by listeners of the show, and Music Week's re-mix of Year Award for Louise's (Naked). He remixed many UK Top 40 hits during his career with artists like Taylor Dayne and East 17. Between 1994 and 1998 his popularity with the clubbing public was rivaled by only Paul Oakenfold and Carl Cox. In September 2010, Mixmag UK announced the nominations of 35 DJs chosen by other big names in the world of dance music as those they considered the best DJs ever. A subsequent 15-month survey, which polled hundreds of thousands of global votes, asked who was the Greatest DJ of All Time and when the result was announced in January 2011, Tony De-Vit was ranked No 9 and one of four British DJs who made the Top 10." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_De_Vit> .

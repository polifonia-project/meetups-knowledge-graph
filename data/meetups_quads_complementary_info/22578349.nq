<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_Edelman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Julian Francis Edelman (born May 22, 1986) is a former American football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons with the New England Patriots. He played college football at Kent State as a quarterback and was selected in the seventh round of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Patriots, where he transitioned to a return specialist and wide receiver. Edelman became a primary offensive starter in 2013 and was a staple of the Patriots' receiving corps until his retirement after the 2020 season. Although never selected to a Pro Bowl, Edelman was one of the NFL's most productive postseason receivers. He ranks second in postseason receiving yards and receptions and holds the Super Bowl records for punt returns and first-half receptions in a single game. A three-time Super Bowl winner, he was the receiving yards leader during his victories in Super Bowl XLIX and Super Bowl LIII. Edelman was named MVP of the lattermost, where he accounted for more than half his team's receiving yards; in the same season he served a four game suspension for PEDâ€™s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_Edelman> .

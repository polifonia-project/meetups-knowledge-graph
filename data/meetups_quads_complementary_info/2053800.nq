Milne studied at Bishop Wordsworth's School in Salisbury and then at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he taught, and later in Italy under Guido Agosti. In the 1970s, Milne was the first pianist to offer a comprehensive survey of the piano music of Medtner since the composer made his own records. He died on 12 February 2020, at the age of 80." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamish_Milne> .

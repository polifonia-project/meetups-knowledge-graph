<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Vettori> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniel Luca Vettori ONZM (born 27 January 1979) is a New Zealand cricket coach and former cricketer who played for the New Zealand national cricket team. He was the 200th player to win their Test cricket cap for New Zealand. Vettori was the youngest male player to have represented New Zealand in Test cricket, making his debut in February 1997 at the age of 18. He captained New Zealand between 2007 and 2011 and is New Zealand's most-capped Test cricketer and One Day International cricketer, with 112 Test caps and 291 ODI caps. A bowling all-rounder, Vettori was the eighth player in Test cricket history to take 300 wickets and score 3,000 runs. A slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, Vettori was known for his accuracy, flight and guile rather than prodigious turn. Vettori announced his retirement from all forms of cricket following the 2015 Cricket World Cup. He has since coached in a variety of roles." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Vettori> .

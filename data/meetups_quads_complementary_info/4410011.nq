<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fakhar-e-Alam> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Fakhar-e-Alam (Punjabi, Urdu: فخر عالم) (born 19 January 1976 in Lahore) is a Pakistani actor, TV host, video jockey, and singer, famous for introducing the bhangra-rap fusion genre of music in Pakistan. Though he is still considered a pioneer of bhangra-rap music culture in Pakistan, he is now more popular for hosting TV shows, sports broadcasts, and high-profile national and international productions. He also served as the chairman of the Sindh Board of Film Censors from 2013 to 2016. In 2018, he became the first and, to date, the only Pakistani in world history to circumnavigate the globe in a solo flight, in what he called Mission Parwaaz. He was aiming for a 28-day schedule and was planning on flying to 30 airports around the world. Fakhar-e-Alam is the grandson of Akleem Akhtar." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fakhar-e-Alam> .

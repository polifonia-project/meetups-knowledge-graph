<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loa_Falkman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Carl Johan \"Loa\" Falkman (born 24 July 1947) is a Swedish opera singer, actor and artist. He was appointed hovsångare by H.M. the King of Sweden in 2003. After studying music, Falkman made his first major performance on the Royal Swedish Opera in 1973. In Melodifestivalen 1990 (Swedish preselection contest for the Eurovision Song Contest), Falkman got the last place with his song \"Symfonin\" (\"The Symphony\"). He often plays pompous, vile characters like Wall-Enberg in Lilla Jönssonligan, Tillström in Newsmakers or Factory Owner Persson in Kronjuvelerna." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loa_Falkman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded as among the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its \"melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture\". Born in Salzburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. His father took him on a grand tour of Europe and then three trips to Italy. At 17, he was a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, Mozart was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He stayed in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years there, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas. His Requiem was largely unfinished by the time of his death at the age of 35, the circumstances of which are uncertain and much mythologized." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loa_Falkman> .

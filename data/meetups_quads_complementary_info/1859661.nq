<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karoline_Leach> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Karoline Leach (born 20 July 1967) is a British playwright and author, best known for her book In the Shadow of the Dreamchild (ISBN 0-7206-1044-3), which re-examines the life of Lewis Carroll (pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. This book and her subsequent work on what she terms the \"Carroll Myth\" have been major sources of upheaval and controversy in recent years and she has produced very polarized responses from Carroll scholars and lay enthusiasts. Leach was born in Liverpool. She studied acting and worked as both actor and director in British theatre before becoming a writer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karoline_Leach> .

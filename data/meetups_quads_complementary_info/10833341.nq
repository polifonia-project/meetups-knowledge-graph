<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winky_D> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Winky D (born Wallace Chirumiko, 1 February 1983) is a Zimbabwean reggae-dancehall artist, known popularly as \"The Big Man\" (stylized as \"Di Bigman\"), and also known as Dancehall Igwe, Gaffa, Ninja President, Proffessor, Extraterrestrial (stylized as ChiExtra) etc. He is often considered the Zimdancehall pioneer and one of the most accomplished modern Zimbabwean music artists. Not much is known about his wife but he in a few songs has mentioned his child's name Tayenda. The gaffas have continued to defend him about this issue claiming that it could be because of the respect he has for his family that he keeps them far from drama. He was born in Kambuzuma,a high density suburb in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. He was also a presenter for the Rockers Vibes programme that was an all reggae programme, together with Trevor Hall and Belemnite Zimunya. Winky D was among the artists featured in the Southern Africa Music Airwaves (SAMA) Festival 2009." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winky_D> .

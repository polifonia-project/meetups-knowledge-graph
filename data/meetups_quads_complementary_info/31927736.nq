<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Lucas_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Lucas (born David Helfman April 21, 1937) is an American rock and roll composer, singer, and music producer. He has written thousands of commercial jingles, such as AT&T's \"Reach Out and Touch Someone.\" In 1981, he received a Clio Award for composing the music to Pepsi's \"Catch That Pepsi Spirit.\" As a record producer, he worked with many new artists such as Blue Öyster Cult. On the 1976 Blue Öyster Cult song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" which he co-produced, Lucas sang backup vocals and came up with the idea for using a cowbell, parodied by Christopher Walken in the \"More cowbell\" skit on Saturday Night Live. In June 2011, Lucas was inducted into Buffalo's Music Hall of Fame." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Lucas_(composer)> .

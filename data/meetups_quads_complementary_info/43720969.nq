Grace did not only excel on the competition floor, but also outside in her community. Grace spent 670 hours of community service with multiple non-profits including Florida Diabetes Camp, Dream Team and the athletic Goodwill Gators volunteering organization. Her desire to help others and her compassion for furthering the education of children and youth won her the 2018 SEC Brad Davis Community Service Scholarship for her graduate school studies. This scholarship is awarded to one female and one male athlete each year from all athletes competing in the Southeastern Conference. Grace is among two students who have received this award from the University of Florida. Grace graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Family, Youth and Community Sciences and a minor in Educational studies. She continued her graduate studies at Nova Southeastern University and graduated with a Master of Public Health in 2021. Grace currently is in a Master of Physician Assistant Studies at Gannon University and will graduate in the program's 2023 cohort." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grace_McLaughlin> .

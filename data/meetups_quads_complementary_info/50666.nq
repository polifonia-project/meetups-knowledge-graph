<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frederick, Prince of Wales, KG (Frederick Louis, German: Friedrich Ludwig; 31 January 1707 â€“ 31 March 1751), was the eldest son and heir apparent of King George II of Great Britain. He grew estranged from his parents, King George and Queen Caroline. Frederick was the father of King George III. Under the Act of Settlement passed by the English Parliament in 1701, Frederick was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne at birth, after his great-grandmother Sophia, Dowager Electress of Hanover; his grandfather George, Elector of Hanover; and his father, George, Electoral Prince of Hanover. The Elector ascended the British throne in 1714. After his grandfather died and his father became king in 1727, Frederick moved to Great Britain and was created Prince of Wales in 1729. He predeceased his father, however, and upon the latter's death in 1760, the throne passed to Frederick's eldest son, George III." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick,_Prince_of_Wales> .

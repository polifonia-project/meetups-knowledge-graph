<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Burns> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Karl Burns (born Carl Birtles,1958 in Manchester, England) is a British musician best known as the drummer for the Fall, featuring in many incarnations of the band between 1977 and 1998. Although several musicians have rejoined the Fall having previously left or been fired, Burns was reportedly rehired a record nine times. He eventually left for good, alongside longtime bassist Steve Hanley, following an on-stage altercation with group leader Mark E. Smith in New York in April 1998." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Burns> .

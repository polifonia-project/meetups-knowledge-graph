<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Undine_Smith_Moore> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Undine Eliza Anna Smith Moore (25 August 1904 – 6 February 1989), the \"Dean of Black Women Composers\", was an American composer and professor of music in the twentieth century. Moore was originally trained as a classical pianist, but developed a compositional output of mostly vocal music—her preferred genre. Much of her work was inspired by black spirituals and folk music. Undine Smith Moore was a renowned teacher, and once stated that she experienced \"teaching itself as an art\". Towards the end of her life, she received many awards for her accomplishments as a music educator." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Undine_Smith_Moore> .

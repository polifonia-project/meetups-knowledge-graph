<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ted_Mulry> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Martin Albert Mulry (2 September 1947 – 1 September 2001) professionally known as Ted Mulry, was an English-born Australian singer, songwriter, bass player and guitarist. As a solo artist, his second single, \"Falling in Love Again\" (February 1971), reached No. 11 on the Go-Set National Top 60. From September 1972 he led his own band, Ted Mulry Gang, which were also credited as TMG. They had a number-one hit single on the Kent Music Report with \"Jump in My Car\" (September 1975) and top ten appearances with a cover version of \"Darktown Strutters' Ball\" (February 1976), and with \"Jamaica Rum\" (January 1977) and \"My Little Girl\" (May). Their second album, Struttin (May 1976), also reached the top ten. The group disbanded in 1986, although periodically reformed. Mulry announced in February 2001 that he had been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour. In the next month numerous music artists responded with Gimme Ted, a series of benefit concerts, which were recorded for a 2×DVD video tribute album, Gimme Ted – The Ted Mulry Benefit Concerts (May 2003). Mulry died of his tumour one day before his 54th birthday." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ted_Mulry> .

She experienced top 10 Billboard placements at seventeen with her debut album VYP (Voice of the Young People) (2008) which debuted at #25 on the Billboard 200. The album spawned her four major singles including her staple song and dance anthem \"Lip Gloss\", earning her two Teen Choice Awards and Monster Single of the Year nominations at the MTV VMA's. Lil Mama gained further attention in Pop music after a collaboration with Avril Lavigne, for the remix of her hit single \"Girlfriend\". Lil Mama took a hiatus from music after success of her hit single \"Hustler Girl\" to stay focused on serving as a judge for total of seven seasons on MTV's America's Best Dance Crew at the age of nineteen from 2008â€“2012, which made her one of the youngest judges on any competitive television show in history. Working with producer and fellow judge Randy Jackson, she served alongside JC Chasez, Shane Sparks, Mario Lopez, and Layla Kayleigh. She was cast in her breakout role of the late Hip-Hop artist Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, in the VH1 biographical film CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, which aired in October 2013 and garnered 4.5 million views in the first night. From the success of the film, Lil Mama joined TLC on their tour for their Greatest Hits album. She got the opportunity to perform a tribute to the late rapper at the 2013 American Music Awards performing the Grammy Award winning song \"Waterfalls\". Lil Mama continued to remain in the public eye, returning to music, making new tracks with fellow rapper MC Lyte on her single \"Ball\". She made Billboard history again with her song \"Sausage\" at the BET Awards. She appeared on multiple magazine covers and was back in television with Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta. On June 13, 2019, she starred in the movie All In, alongside Traci Braxton." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lil_Mama> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loudon_Wainwright_III> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Loudon Snowden Wainwright III (born September 5, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter and occasional actor. He has released twenty-six studio albums, four live albums, and six compilations. Some of his best-known songs include \"The Swimming Song\", \"Motel Blues\", \"The Man Who Couldn't Cry\", \"Dead Skunk\", and \"Lullaby\". In 2007, he collaborated with musician Joe Henry to create the soundtrack for Judd Apatow's film Knocked Up. In addition to music, he has acted in small roles in at least eighteen television programs and feature films, including three episodes in the third season of the series M*A*S*H. Reflecting upon his career in 1999, he stated, \"You could characterize the catalog as somewhat checkered, although I prefer to think of it as a tapestry.\" In 2017, Wainwright released his autobiography, Liner Notes: On Parents & Children, Exes & Excess, Death & Decay, and a Few of My Other Favorite Things. He is the brother of singer Sloan Wainwright and has four children, including musicians Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, and Lucy Wainwright Roche. He has been married and divorced twice, including to folk singer Kate McGarrigle." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loudon_Wainwright_III> .

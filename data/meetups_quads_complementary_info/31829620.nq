His 2013 sophomore full-length Head In The Dirt was produced by the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach. His album Moonlight was released on January 20, 2015. He was described by The Guardian as a “former skate-punk raised on vintage rock and R&B [who] is keeping the spirit of 76 alive with his primal raunch ‘n’ roll.”" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanni_El_Khatib> .

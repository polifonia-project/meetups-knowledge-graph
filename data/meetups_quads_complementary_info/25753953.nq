<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Donington> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Donington OBE (4 May 1907 â€“ 20 January 1990) was a British musicologist and instrumentalist influential in the early music movement and in Wagner studies. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, and studied at the University of Oxford. His expert knowledge of early instruments and the interpretation of pre-classical music owed much to a period of study with Arnold Dolmetsch at Haslemere, Surrey. He was appointed OBE in the 1979 Birthday Honours. He was born in Leeds, and died in Firle, Sussex at the age of 82." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Donington> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zé_Rodrix> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Zé Rodrix (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈzɛ ʁoˈdɾiks]; 25 November 1947 – 22 May 2009) was a Brazilian composer, instrumentalist, and singer. He was well known in his native country for performing with musical ensembles Sá, Rodrix & Guarabyra, Som Imaginário and Momento Quatro. A native of Rio de Janeiro, José Rodrigues Trindade used a modified spelling of his middle name as part of his stage name throughout a career that spanned over four decades. Som Imaginario, with another well-known member, Robertinho Silva, accompanied Milton Nascimento and Gal Costa and, in 1971, Elis Regina's recording of his rock-rural \"Casa no Campo\" (with Tavito) became a huge hit. During the 1970s, Sá e Guarabyra would continue as a duo while Rodrix pursued a solo career. Both acts played what they described as \"rural rock\", \"a synthesis of the escapist dream depicted in the American folk-rock songs of the '60s within the reality of upcountry Brazil\". A longtime resident of São Paulo, Zé Rodrix died of natural causes at the age of 61." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zé_Rodrix> .

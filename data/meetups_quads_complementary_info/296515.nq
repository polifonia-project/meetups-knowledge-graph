<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdurrahman_Wahid> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Abdurrahman Wahid (/ˌɑːbdʊəˈrɑːxmɑːn wɑːˈhiːd/ AHB-doo-RAHKH-mahn wah-HEED; born Abdurrahman ad-Dakhil; 7 September 1940 – 30 December 2009), though more colloquially known as Gus Dur, was an Indonesian politician and Islamic religious leader who served as the 4th president of Indonesia, from his election in 1999 until his removal from power in 2001. A long time leader within the Nahdlatul Ulama organization, he was the founder of the National Awakening Party (PKB). He was the son of Minister of Religious Affairs Wahid Hasyim, and the grandson of Nahdatul Ulama founder Hasyim Asy'ari. He had a visual impairment caused by glaucoma. He was blind on the left eye and partially blind on his right eye. He was the first and as of 2022 the only president of Indonesia to have had physical disabilities. His popular nickname 'Gus Dur' is derived from Gus, a common honorific for a son of kyai, and from the short-form of bagus ('handsome lad' in Javanese); and Dur, short-form of his name, Abdurrahman." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdurrahman_Wahid> .

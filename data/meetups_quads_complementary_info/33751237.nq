Harris formed the first and longest running hip-hop dance touring company, Rennie Harris Puremovement in 1992. In 2007, he conceived another touring company, RHAW or Rennie Harris Awe-Inspiring Works. Harris has received numerous awards for his theatrical hip-hop dance performances or what he refers to as, \"Hip-Hop concert dance\". He is known for such works as Rome and Jewels, Facing Mekka, 100 NAKED LOCKS, Heaven, and a host of innovative repertory works, which have broken many stereotypes and expectations of hip-hop dance. After receiving an honorary doctorate from Bates College and an honorary doctorate from Columbia College, Harris' company was chosen as 1 of 4 US companies to serve as cultural ambassadors for President Obama's \"Dance Motion USA.\" In 2012, it toured the Middle East, performing and giving hip hop workshops to Egyptians, Israelis and Palestinians." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rennie_Harris> .

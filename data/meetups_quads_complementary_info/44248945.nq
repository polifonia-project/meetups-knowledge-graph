<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jackie_Hill_Perry> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jackie Hill Perry (n√©e Jackie Hill, born June 21, 1989) is an American poet, writer, and hip hop artist who initially garnered popularity for her performances of spoken word pieces such as \"My Life as a Stud\", \"A Poem About Weed\", and \"Jig-a-Boo\" at the Passion 4 Christ Movement (P4CM). She has written for various Christian ministry organizations, such as The Resurgence and John Piper's Desiring God, on the topic of Christianity and homosexuality. She signed to the Portland, Oregon-based Christian hip hop label Humble Beast in January 2014, and released her debut album on November 4, 2014, available both commercially and for free. Hill married fellow spoken word artist Preston Perry in March 2014; the couple currently has four children. An encounter with sexual abuse as a child contributed to the confusion over her gender identity she faced while growing up, and Jackie Hill Perry at age seventeen discovered that she was a lesbian. She lived a life of sexual promiscuity and struggled with drug and pornography addiction, until her conversion to Christianity in 2008. Her self-proclaimed status as a former lesbian has sparked controversy, with many gay rights activists stating that sexual orientation cannot be changed and that Jackie Hill Perry's experience lend credence to the idea of conversion therapy. Jackie Hill Perry, however, maintains her belief that God can transform lives and that he empowers believers to resist temptation." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jackie_Hill_Perry> .

His daughter, Laura Ephrikian, is an actress. Angelo Ephrikian was born in Treviso, Italy. He learned the violin from 1919, with Luigi Ferro. However, after he attended law school he immediately began working in the legal field. Angelo Ephrikian then gave up his legal career in order to join the resistance movement against Italian fascism by joining partisan forces. However, after World War II, he immediately became a musical conductor. Ephrikian was a pioneer of early Italian music. Ephrikian took a very active part in the rediscovery of the works of Vivaldi. Ephrikian directed the first contemporary opera of Vivaldi's Fida Ninfa in 1958. Angelo Ephrikian died in Rome in 1982. He founded the independent Arcophon record label in 1960, recorded the complete works of Gesualdo with the Quintetto Vocale Italiano by 1965.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonny_Bono> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Salvatore Phillip \"Sonny\" Bono (/ˈboʊnoʊ/; February 16, 1935 – January 5, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and politician who came to fame in partnership with his second wife Cher as the popular singing duo Sonny & Cher. A member of the Republican Party, Bono served as the 16th mayor of Palm Springs, California, from 1988 to 1992, and served as the U.S. representative for California's 44th district from 1995 until his death in 1998. The United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which extended the term of copyright by 20 years, was named in honor of Bono when it was passed by Congress nine months after his death. Mary Bono (one of Sonny's widows) had been one of the original sponsors of the legislation, commonly known as the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonny_Bono> .

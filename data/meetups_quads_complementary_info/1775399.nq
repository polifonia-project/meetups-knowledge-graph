<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Evans_(Colorado_governor)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Evans (March 9, 1814 â€“ July 2, 1897) was an American politician, physician, founder of various hospitals and medical associations, railroad promoter, governor of the territory of Colorado, and namesake of Evanston, Illinois; Evans, Colorado; and Mount Evans, Colorado. He is most noted for being one of the founders of both Northwestern University and the University of Denver. The John Evans professorships, the highest honors bestowed on faculty members at both Northwestern University and the University of Denver, are named for him. By bringing railroad service to Denver from several directions, he was responsible for the growth of Denver from a settlement to a city. Evans was forced to resign the governorship in 1865 for his role in instigating the Sand Creek massacre, one of the worst massacres of Native Americans in U.S. history." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Evans_(Colorado_governor)> .

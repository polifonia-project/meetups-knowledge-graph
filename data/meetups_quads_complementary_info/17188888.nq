<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Riggs> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Larimore Riggs (February 25, 1918 â€“ October 25, 1995) was an American tennis champion who was the World No. 1 amateur in 1939 and World No. 1 professional in 1946 and 1947. He played his first professional tennis match on December 26, 1941. As a 21-year-old amateur in 1939, Riggs won the singles title at Wimbledon, the U.S. National Championships (now U.S. Open), and was runner-up at the French Championships. He was U.S. champion again in 1941, after a runner-up finish the year before. At the 1939 Wimbledon Championships he also won the Men's Doubles and the Mixed Doubles. After retirement from his pro career, Riggs became well known as a hustler and gambler. He organized numerous exhibition challenges, inviting active and retired tennis pros to participate. In 1973, at age 55, he held two such events, first against the #1-ranked woman player Margaret Smith Court, which he won easily, and then against the then current women's champion Billie Jean King, which he easily lost. The latter, the prime time \"Battle of the Sexes\" match remains one of the most famous tennis events of all time, with a $100,000 ($610,000 today) winner-take-all prize." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Riggs> .

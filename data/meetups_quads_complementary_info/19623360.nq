<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Feltham_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mark Feltham (born 20 October 1955, Bermondsey, Southwark, London) is an English musician, best known for his harmonica playing. Feltham is a long-term member of the British rhythm and blues band Nine Below Zero, and Rory Gallagher's band; and is often used as a session musician. In an interview on the South Bank Show broadcast in 1981, Nine Below Zero guitarist and singer Dennis Greaves noted that Feltham's 'nan' had played the harmonica and his dad bought him his first instrument. Greaves also stated that Feltham had been playing in his bedroom for 11 years, but had given the instrument up for a time before joining Nine Below Zero, his first band. In addition, when he joined he did not know how to play through a microphone or what an amplifier was. Greaves also noted that Feltham studied the music of Little Walter, Charlie McCoy and Junior Wells." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Feltham_(musician)> .

He began his career as a trombonist and also sings, writes, produces and acts. He is also involved in the politics of New York City. Colón is considered a pioneer of Salsa music and a best-selling artist in the genre, having been a key figure in the nascent New York City scene associated with the legendary Fania Records. He is also noteworthy for having assumed the gangster image in his album covers before it was culturally popular." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Colón> .

He has also helped to popularize older songs by American icons, such as \"Move It on Over\", \"Who Do You Love?\", and \"House Rent Blues/One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\". With his band, the Delaware Destroyers, Thorogood has released over 20 albums, two of which have been certified Platinum and six have been certified Gold. He has sold 15 million records worldwide.

Beginning his career as a child actor, Osment's role in the comedy-drama film Forrest Gump (1994) won him a Young Artist Award. His breakthrough came with the psychological thriller film The Sixth Sense (1999), which won him a Saturn Award and earned him nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. He achieved further success with the drama film Pay It Forward (2000), the science fiction film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) which won him a second Saturn Award, and the comedy film Secondhand Lions (2003), which won him a Critics Choice Award. Osment has had a long-running role in the Kingdom Hearts video game franchise, voicing the series' protagonist Sora (2002–present) and the villain Vanitas (2010–2020) in the English versions of the games. He has sporadically appeared on-screen since his Secondhand Lions role, recognizably appearing in Sex Ed (2014) and The Spoils of Babylon (2014). He made his Broadway debut in 2008 in a short-lived revival of David Mamet's play American Buffalo, starring John Leguizamo and Cedric the Entertainer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haley_Joel_Osment> .

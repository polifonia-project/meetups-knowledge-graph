<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luis_Enrique_Vergara> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Luis Enrique Vergara (13 May 1922 – 2 February 1970) was a Mexican film producer and screenwriter who made low-budget horror and monster movies from 1950 to 1971. In attempt to please all film goers, he combined monsters and horror with action, sex, science fiction, and comedy. To save money, he often wrote the screenplay as well as producing the films from his Filmica Vergara Cinecomisiones, a film production company he founded in 1952. During the two decades that Vergara wrote and produced films he worked with actors and actresses including Susana Dosamantes, Macaria, Altia Michel, Isela Vega, John Carradine, and Boris Karloff. He produced the last four films in which Boris Karloff appeared: The Snake People, The Incredible Invasion, Fear Chamber, and House of Evil. Bill Warren, the science-fiction historian, was on the set during the filming; he reported that Vergara forced the director of the American sequences Jack Hill to tie down with a rope “an early portable video camera to the top of the 35mm Mitchell he was using as his principal camera”, a relatively early example of the \"video assist\" which is now standard practice in commercial film production. Due to his unexpected death, the release of the Karloff films was held up due to ownership rights of inheritance under Mexican law." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luis_Enrique_Vergara> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mustard_(record_producer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dijon Isaiah McFarlane (born June 5, 1990), known professionally as Mustard (also known as DJ Mustard), is an American record producer and beatmaker. He is a frequent collaborator of fellow California-bred artists YG and Ty Dolla Sign; among various other records for the hip hop and R&B genres since his entrance into mainstream music with Tyga's 2011 single, \"Rack City\". Mustard's production style has been described as an up-tempo, club-oriented, catchy yet rudimentary melodic hip hop style. This style has developed into the contemporary production style of West Coast hip hop during the early 2010s, which he calls \"ratchet music\". Almost all of his productions begin or end with the tag \"Mustard on the beat, ho!\", a voice sample of YG, who says it at the end of \"I'm Good\", one of their early collaborations, as well as claps and repetition of the word \"hey\". Mustard has since released three solo albums: 10 Summers in August 2014, Cold Summer in September 2016, and Perfect Ten in June 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mustard_(record_producer)> .

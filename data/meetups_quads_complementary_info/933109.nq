<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teena_Marie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Christine Brockert (March 5, 1956 â€“ December 26, 2010), known professionally as Teena Marie, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, composer, arranger, and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina before taking the stage name Teena Marie and later acquired the nickname Lady T, given to her by her collaborator and friend, Rick James. She was known for her distinctive soprano vocals, which caused many listeners to believe she was black. Her success in R&B and soul music, and loyalty to these genres would earn her the title Ivory Queen of Soul. She played rhythm guitar, keyboards, and congas. Teena Marie was a three-time Grammy Award nominee." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teena_Marie> .

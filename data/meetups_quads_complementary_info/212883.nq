Born in Seville to Irish parents, Wiseman was educated at a school in Waterford before attending St. Cuthbert's College at Ushaw. From there he went to the English College in Rome, where he subsequently became Rector. While in Rome, he was assigned to preach to the English Catholics there. As Rector, he was the representative of the English bishops. During a visit to England in 1836, he helped initiate the periodical Dublin Review. In 1840, he was appointed president of Oscott College." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_Wiseman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Brown_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Willie Lee Brown (August 6, 1900 â€“ December 30, 1952) was an American blues guitar player and vocalist. He performed and recorded with other blues musicians, including Son House and Charlie Patton, and influenced Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. Brown is considered one of the pioneering musicians of the Delta blues genre. Brown worked as a side player, performing mostly with House, Patton, and Johnson. He recorded six sides for Paramount Records in Grafton, Wisconsin in 1930, which were subsequently released on 78-rpm discs. He made three recordings for the Library of Congress in 1941, accompanied by House. In 1952, Brown briefly joined House in Rochester, New York, but soon returned to Tunica, Mississippi, where he died the same year. Although normally an accompanist, Brown recorded three highly rated solo performances: \"M & O Blues\", \"Make Me a Pallet on the Floor\" and \"Future Blues\". He disappeared from the music scene during the 1940s, together with House, and died before the blues revival of the 1960s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Brown_(musician)> .

He is best remembered as a blues guitarist who had a distinctive single-string slide style. His songwriting and his bottleneck technique influenced other leading Chicago blues guitarists, such as Big Bill Broonzy, Robert Nighthawk and Muddy Waters, and many others, including Elmore James and Mose Allison. In a career spanning over 30 years, he also recorded pop, R&B and hokum songs. His best-known recordings include \"Anna Lou Blues\", \"Black Angel Blues\", \"Crying Won't Help You\", \"It Hurts Me Too\", and \"Love Her with a Feeling\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tampa_Red> .

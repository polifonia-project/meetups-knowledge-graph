<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Romersa> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joe Romersa is an American musician, composer, voice actor, and music producer. Romersa started his career career as a drummer, but early on he branched out into sound engineering. As Romersa tells it, \"After a tragic early tour I did at age 19 which left me homeless sleeping on a park bench in New Jersey, I had to find a way to make money and still be close to what I love; music.\" Romersa later studied sound engineering. Combining his fledgling career as a professional musician with the more stable income of sound engineering allowed Romersa to hone his craft as both a drummer/percussionist and as a sound engineer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joe_Romersa> .

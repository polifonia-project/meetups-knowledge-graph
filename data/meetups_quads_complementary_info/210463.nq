<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sylvia_Robinson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sylvia Robinson (née Vanderpool; May 29, 1935 – September 29, 2011) was an American singer, record producer, and record label executive. Robinson achieved success as a performer on two R&B chart toppers: as half of Mickey & Sylvia with the 1957 single \"Love Is Strange\", and her solo record \"Pillow Talk\" in 1973. She later became known for her work as founder and CEO of the hip hop label Sugar Hill Records. Robinson is credited as the driving force behind two landmark singles in the hip hop genre: \"Rapper's Delight\" (1979) by the Sugarhill Gang, and \"The Message\" (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, both of which she produced. Several publications have dubbed her as \"The Mother of Hip Hop\". At the 11th Annual Rhythm and Blues Awards Gala in 2000, she received a Pioneer Award for her career in singing and for founding Sugarhill Records and in 2022, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Ahmet Ertegun Award category for being a major influence on the creative development of hip-hop's early successes and is the second woman to receive the honor, after Cynthia Weil." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sylvia_Robinson> .

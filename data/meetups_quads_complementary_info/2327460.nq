<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logan_Mader> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Logan Conrad Mader (born November 16, 1970) is a Canadian record producer and current guitarist of melodic death metal band Once Human, as well as the former lead guitarist of groove metal band Machine Head. Mader is most famous for his time in Machine Head, whose 1994 debut Burn My Eyes was released by Roadrunner Records and quickly became the top-selling debut album in the label's history until Slipknot's debut album. Their second album, The More Things Change..., was released in 1997 and Logan left the band shortly thereafter to divert his energy and time to side projects. Mader co-founded Dirty Icon Productions, a Los Angeles-based production team. They write, produce, record, mix, master, and engineer music for other artists." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logan_Mader> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helen_Merrill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Helen Merrill (born Jelena Ana Milcetic; July 21, 1930) is an American jazz vocalist. Her first album, the eponymous 1954 recording Helen Merrill (with Clifford Brown), was an immediate success and associated her with the first generation of bebop jazz musicians. After an active 1950s and 1960s, Merrill spent time recording and touring in Europe and Japan, falling into obscurity in the United States. In the 1980s and '90s, she was under contract with Verve and her performances in America revived her profile. Known for her emotional, sensual vocal performances, her career continues in its sixth decade with concerts and recordings." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helen_Merrill> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Katherine_Hoover> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Katherine Hoover (December 2, 1937 – September 21, 2018) is remembered by the National Flute Association as an \"artist—flutist, teacher, entrepreneur, poet, and, most notably, a distinguished composer\". Her work received many honors, including a National Endowment Composer's Fellowship, an Academy of Arts and Letters Award in composition, the National Flute Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. There are two works where she cowrote under the pseudonym Kathryn Scott. Her career as a composer began at a time when few women composers earned recognition in classical music in the 1970s. As shown in her list of known work, below, she has composed pieces for solo flute, mixed ensembles, chamber orchestra, choir acapella, full orchestra and many other combinations of instruments and voice. Some of her flute pieces incorporated Native American themes." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Katherine_Hoover> .

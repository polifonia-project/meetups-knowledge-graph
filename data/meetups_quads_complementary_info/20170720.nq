<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saenchai> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Suphachai \"Saenchai\" Saepong (born July 30, 1980), formerly known as Saenchai Sor. Kingstar (Thai: แสนชัย ส.คิงสตาร์), is a Muay Thai fighter of Khon Isan descent. Saenchai won the Lumpinee Stadium title, which is widely considered the most prestigious title in Muay Thai, in four different weight divisions, while mostly fighting larger opponents. He is considered by many to be the best pound for pound Muay Thai fighter, and is regarded as one of the best fighters of all time. Saenchai would often give up weight to find worthy opponents in Thailand, and from 2003-2014 only lost two times in Thailand when the weights were equal, with all other losses happening when he was forced to have a weight disadvantage to make the fights more evenly matched. Against foreigners the gap in skill is so great he will go up as high as 147 pounds, which is 15+ pounds above his optimal weight class. Since 2010 he has fought 88 times in 15 countries and is perhaps the most active international fighter. He is known for his excellent head movement, defensive footwork, unconventional kicks, and jumping attacks. His speed, athleticism, and the large variety in his unorthodox arsenal made him an exceptionally difficult opponent to prepare for. He retired from serious competition in Thailand in 2014 and now solely competes in showcase fights around the world against foreign, usually bigger opponents. Upon retiring from competition on the Thai circuit he was still able to make 130 pounds, with his final fight being forced to make 129 pounds. Since 2014, Saenchai has frequently competed at the Thai Fight promotion, a Thailand-based promotion. He has often been the headliner at more recent Thai Fight events and has won four King's Cup titles with the promotion at 67 kg and 70 kg. He holds the promotion's records for most titles with 4 and all-time wins with 43." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saenchai> .

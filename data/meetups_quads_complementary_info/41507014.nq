Sledge is best known for frequently collaborating with Top Dawg Entertainment recording artists Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Kendrick Lamar, and Jay Rock. He has also worked with several other prominent rappers, such as Freddie Gibbs, Warren G, Nekfeu, Big K.R.I.T., GLC, Kanye West, Anderson .Paak, and Joey Badass, among numerous others. Sledge's first work in the music industry was on a Dave Hollister record in 2001, titled \"For You\", which he co-wrote alongside Gerald Haddon. Sledge's vocals were first featured on a high-profile single in 2006: a song by Chicago rapper Kanye West titled \"Impossible\", released in promotion for the 2006 American film Mission: Impossible III. In February 2012, he independently released his debut studio album, Pineapple Now-Laters. Sledge subsequently secured a record deal with Motown, in August 2012. The label then serviced the Pineapple Now-Laters song \"Good Luv'n\", as Sledge's commercial debut single." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/BJ_the_Chicago_Kid> .

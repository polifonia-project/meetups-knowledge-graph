<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Turrell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Turrell (born May 6, 1943) is an American artist known for his work within the Light and Space movement. Much of Turrell's career has been devoted to a still-unfinished work, Roden Crater, a natural cinder cone crater located outside Flagstaff, Arizona, that he is turning into a massive naked-eye observatory; and for his series of skyspaces, enclosed spaces that frame the sky. Turrell was a MacArthur Fellow in 1984." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Turrell> .

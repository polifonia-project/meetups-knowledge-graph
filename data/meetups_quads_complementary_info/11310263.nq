<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Ellis_Orrall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Ellis Orrall (born May 4, 1955) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Signed to RCA Records in 1980, Orrall debuted that year with the album \"Fixation\". His first Top 40 single was \"I Couldn't Say No\", a duet with Carlene Carter. By 1990, Orrall had found success as a songwriter, having penned Number One singles for Shenandoah and Clay Walker. He returned to RCA in 1991 and charted the singles \"Boom! It Was Over\" (#19) and \"A Little Bit of Her Love\" (#31), from his first country music album, Flying Colors. Orrall then joined frequent songwriting partner Curtis Wright in the CMA-nominated duo Orrall & Wright, recording one more album and charting two singles. They split up in 1994, however, and Orrall returned to his solo career, writing singles for Reba McEntire, Taylor Swift, and Lindsay Lohan, as well as producing records for Swift, Be Your Own Pet, and Love and Theft. He also performs and records as an indie rock musician in the band Monkey Bowl." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Ellis_Orrall> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Alchemist_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alan Daniel Maman (born October 25, 1977), professionally known as the Alchemist (or simply Alchemist), is an American record producer, DJ, rapper and songwriter. He began his music career in 1991 in the hip hop duo The Whooliganz under the moniker Mudfoot, along with now-actor Scott Caan (whose moniker was \"Mad Skillz\"). Due to his musical output from the late 1990s to present day, the Alchemist is widely regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop producers of all time. Together with his longtime collaborator Oh No (with whom he forms the group Gangrene), Woody Jackson and Tangerine Dream, he composed the official score to the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V and hosts radio station The Lab in it." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Alchemist_(musician)> .

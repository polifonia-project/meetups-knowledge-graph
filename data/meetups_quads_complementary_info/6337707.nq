<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kate_McTell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kate McTell (born Ruthy Kate Williams; August 22, 1911 â€“ October 3, 1991) was an American blues musician and nurse from Jefferson County, Georgia. She is known primarily as the former wife of the blues musician Blind Willie McTell, whom she accompanied vocally on several recordings. She may have recorded as Ruby Glaze, but there is some uncertainty about whether she and Glaze were the same person, despite the fact that she claimed to be Glaze." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kate_McTell> .

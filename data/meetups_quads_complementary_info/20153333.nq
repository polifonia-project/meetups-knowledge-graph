<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniele_Alexander> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniele Alexander (born December 2, 1954, in Fort Worth, Texas) is an American country music singer. She began her career as a teenager, performing jazz initially before moving to Las Vegas, Nevada to sing in casinos. She also charted in the Top 20 on the Billboard charts with the single \"She's There\", a single from her 1989 Mercury Records album First Move. In 1990, she was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards, along with Jann Browne and Mary Chapin Carpenter, but lost to Carpenter. A second album, I Dream in Color, produced a duet with labelmate Butch Baker in \"It Wasn't You, It Wasn't Me,\" the last chart single for either artist. Alexander exited Mercury in 1991, and later co-wrote two songs on Mila Mason's 1997 debut That's Enough of That." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniele_Alexander> .

He was with the band from 1967 to 1971 and has collected 3 GRAMMY Awards and 9 Gold Records. Before Blood, Sweat & Tears, Lipsius played with the Ronn Metcalfe Orchestra. Lipsius has performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Janis Joplin, and jazz greats Cannonball Adderley, Thelonious Monk, Zoot Sims, Eddie Gómez, Al Foster, George Mraz, Larry Willis, Randy Brecker, and Rodney Jones. He has written music for and performed on over 30 CDs as both a leader and sideman. He has authored six books on jazz improvisation and jazz reading. In 2020, Lipsius retired from Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, USA after teaching full-time for 35 years. In retirement, Lipsius has focused his efforts on his visual art. He has been creating digital pieces since 2000 and has had a number of public showings, some of which have been accompanied by his music. Lipsius creates his pieces with Photoshop and other materials and has said of his art, \"Producing this art has been nothing but fun and a big gift for me. My pieces are mostly improvised with little or no preconceived idea of what they should be. In viewing my art, please know that anything you can imagine already exists somewhere!” Lipsius has recently listed some of his pieces as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on OpenSea." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Lipsius> .

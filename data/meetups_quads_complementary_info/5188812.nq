<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcela_Bovio> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Marcela Alejandra Bovio García (born October 17, 1979) is a Mexican singer and violinist who is currently a member of the Dutch symphonic death metal band MaYaN. In 1995, she joined Hydra, a Mexican metal band, singing and playing violin. In 1999 they released an EP called \"Bosquejo\". After leaving them, Bovio co-founded the Mexican experimental rock band Elfonía in 2001, which was active until 2006. In 2003, she responded to a \"casting call\" by Dutch musician Arjen Anthony Lucassen for relatively unknown singers, who chose her to play the character of Wife in the Ayreon album The Human Equation. In 2005, he also picked her for his new project, the progressive metal band Stream of Passion. The band released their debut album Embrace the Storm the same year, with Bovio acting as sole lyricist. Lucassen left the band to continue on its own in 2007; this resulted in Bovio acting as band leader and one of the main songwriters (including for composition) on subsequent albums. Stream of Passion amicably disbanded in December 2016. In September 2016, Bovio independently released her first solo album, Unprecedented, a classical album consisting of original songs she wrote; it was followed by Through Your Eyes in 2018. She joined MaYaN as a full-time member in 2017, after regular collaborations with the band since 2013. She regularly acts as backing vocalist for other bands, notably Epica and The Gentle Storm, and was also one of the founding members of VUUR in 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcela_Bovio> .

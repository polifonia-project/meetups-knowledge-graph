She is best known for her first single \"Undo Me\" from her debut album, Kansas (1998), and the song \"A Little More\" from her Grammy Award-nominated album, Lay It Down (2000). The Way I Am (2001), was also nominated for a Grammy. In total, the three albums have sold approximately 1 million copies. After taking a seven-year hiatus, Knapp announced in September 2009 that she was returning to music. On May 11, 2010 she released Letting Go with the single \"Dive In\". The album debuted at No. 73 on the Billboard 200 chart. Knapp's memoir Facing the Music (Howard Books / Simon & Schuster) and new album Set Me Free (Righteous Babe Records) came out in October 2014. Her 2017 album release, Love Comes Back Around produced by Viktor Krauss, pairs her fearless songwriting and strong, expressive voice with rootsy arrangements." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jennifer_Knapp> .

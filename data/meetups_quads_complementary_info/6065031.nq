He was best known for having composed the theme song to the children's TV series Play School for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC); the lyrics were penned by Rosemary Milne. In 2017 the tune was added to the list of the top 10 Sounds of Australia list by the National Film and Sound Archive for being culturally, historically and aesthetically significant. Connolly's published and performed works allowed him to be counted among Australia's most prolific composers of Catholic Church music, particularly the hymns he composed for the church in Australia which are now published and used inter-denominationally. His hymns were composed to accommodate and adorn the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council. He was noted for his collaborations with Australian poet James McAuley. His compositions were successful internationally, both in the Christian and secular fields." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Connolly_(composer)> .

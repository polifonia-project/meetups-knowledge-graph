At age 13, Farley began opening for Brantley Gilbert. She also sang background vocals on Gilbert's 2012 single \"Kick It in the Sticks\". She signed with Red Bow, a partnership of Broken Bow Records and RED Distribution, in 2012. Red Bow released her debut single, \"Ain't Easy\", in early 2013. Billy Dukes from Taste of Country gave the single a 3-star rating out of 5, saying that it \"doesn't quite separate itself from the pack\" but that it \"will no doubt work as a live anthem\". Ashley Cooke of Roughstock rated it 5 out of 5, saying that \"Thereâ€™s room for a new young female artist in Country Music and with her sassy, confident sound and rebellious demeanor, Farley may just have claimed that spot.\" \"Ain't Easy\" was a minor Top 40 hit on the Billboard Country Airplay charts, reaching a peak of number 36. It was followed by \"Midnight Road\" later in 2013, which failed to chart, and Farley subsequently parted ways with Red Bow." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rachel_Farley> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glen_Chapple> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Glen Chapple (born 23 January 1974) is an English cricket coach and former cricketer. He is an all-rounder, and represented the national team in a One Day International, as well as performing well for Lancashire over many years. He bowls right-arm fast-medium, and is a right-handed batsman. With six first-class centuries to his name, Chapple shares with Mark Pettini the record for fastest first-class century, scored against declaration bowling by Glamorgan in 1993, coming off just 27 balls. Chapple played a single One Day International for England, against Ireland in 2006 but was injured after bowling one over. After Stuart Law left the club, Chapple was appointed as Lancashire's captain from the 2009 season onwards and led the county to victory in the 2011 County Championship. That year he became the fifth player to score 7,000 runs and take 700 wickets for Lancashire. In 2012 he was named as one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glen_Chapple> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logan_Paul> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Logan Alexander Paul (born April 1, 1995) is an American media personality, podcaster, actor, and professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand, but is inactive due to a knee injury. He has over 23 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, and has ranked on the Forbes list for the highest paid YouTube creators in 2017, 2018, and 2021. Paul has also run the Impaulsive podcast since November 2018, which has over 4 million YouTube subscribers. Paul gained a following in 2013, posting sketches on the video-sharing application Vine. He registered his YouTube channel, TheOfficialLoganPaul, on October 18, 2013, where he started posting regularly following the closure of the Vine app. He later created the Logan Paul Vlogs channel on August 29, 2015, which has since become his most-subscribed YouTube channel. As of January 2022, the channel has received 23.2 million subscribers and over 5.8 billion views, ranking as the 74th most-subscribed channel in the United States, and placing him among the most-subscribed channels on the platform. As an actor, Paul's television and film work includes guest appearances on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Bizaardvark, and roles in films The Thinning (2016) and The Thinning: New World Order (2018). He has also explored other avenues; he released his debut single \"2016\" in 2016, and fought English media personality KSI in an amateur white-collar boxing match in 2018. The fight ended in a majority draw. In the 2019 rematch, which was a professional bout, KSI won by split decision. Paul signed a multi-event contract with WWE in 2022 and has since performed at events such as SummerSlam, in which he defeated The Miz in his debut singles match, and Crown Jewel, in which he lost to Undisputed WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns in the main event. Paul has been involved in several controversies, most notably in relation to a trip to Japan in December 2017, during which he visited the Aokigahara \"suicide forest\", filmed the body of a suicide victim, and uploaded the footage to his YouTube channel." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Logan_Paul> .

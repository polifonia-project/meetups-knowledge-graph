He is best known as the drummer of the indie rock band Frightened Rabbit, with whom he recorded five studio albums. In 2022, Hutchison joined The Twilight Sad after a four-year hiatus from performing, following the death of his brother and bandmate, Scott Hutchison. Frightened Rabbit began as a solo project for Grant's brother Scott, him joining in 2004. The duo recorded the band's debut album, Sing the Greys (2006). Hutchison performed on each of the band's releases, and contributed to the songwriting process of the band's fourth studio album, Pedestrian Verse (2013). In 2018, the Hutchison brothers formed the supergroup Mastersystem with James and Justin Lockey, releasing a studio album, Dance Music (2018)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grant_Hutchison> .

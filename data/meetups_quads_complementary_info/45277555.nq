Her music is described by herself as \"Sailor Moon R&B\" and \"future pop\". and her music has been continuously stated to be \"unapologetically pop\" sounding. Liz gained more attention in 2015 when she released a single, made with producer Sophie, called \"When I Rule the World\" which first appeared in a Samsung commercial. She is additionally recognized for her late 1990s/early 2000s influence which is prevalent in both her music and fashion. The \"Y2K\" in her social media handles is in reference to this." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liz_(musician)> .

Bass Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Stanford University. Along with Horst L. St√∂rmer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University, he was awarded a share of the 1998 Nobel Prize in physics for their explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect. In 1983, Laughlin was first to provide a many body wave function, now known as the Laughlin wavefunction, for the fractional quantum hall effect, which was able to correctly explain the fractionalized charge observed in experiments. This state has since been interpreted as the integer quantum Hall effect of the composite fermion. His 2017 paper, \"Pumped thermal grid storage with heat exchange\" inspired Project Malta at Google X and subsequently Malta inc." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_B._Laughlin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Ritchie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jean Ruth Ritchie (December 8, 1922 â€“ June 1, 2015) was an American folk singer, songwriter, and Appalachian dulcimer player, called by some the \"Mother of Folk\". In her youth she learned hundreds of folk songs in the traditional way (orally, from her family and community), many of which were Appalachian variants of centuries old British and Irish songs, including dozens of Child Ballads. In adulthood, she shared these songs with wide audiences, as well as writing some of her own songs using traditional foundations. She is ultimately responsible for the revival of the Appalachian dulcimer, the traditional instrument of her community, which she popularized by playing the instrument on her albums and writing tutorial books. She also spent time collecting folk music in the United States and in Britain and Ireland, in order to research the origins of her family songs and help preserve traditional music. She inspired a wide array of musicians, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Shirley Collins, Joni Mitchell, Emmylou Harris and Judy Collins." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Ritchie> .

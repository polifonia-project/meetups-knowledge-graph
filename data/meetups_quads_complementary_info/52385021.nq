Known for her smooth voice and message-based music, she currently lives and works in Germany. She was born in Brazzaville in 1973 to Michael Okomo and Charlotte Nkounkolo and moved to Heiligenhaus, Germany, near Düsseldorf, in 1987. She has spoken of the culture shock she experienced with this move, finding a contrast between the bustle of Brazzaville and the small-town, often empty, streets of Heiligenhaus. As a teenager Niasony worked as a model, dancer and performance artist for various projects. In 2013, Niasony was honored by the African Youth Foundation with an ADLER award for being an ambassador for African culture. Niasony lives in Düsseldorf, Germany" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Niasony> .

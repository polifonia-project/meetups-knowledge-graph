<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patrik_Jensen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Patrik Jensen (born 24 November 1969) is a Swedish guitarist and co-founder of the bands, The Haunted (1996-present), and Witchery (1997-present), and also the former guitarist of the bands Orchriste (1987-1990), Seance (1990-1995) Satanic Slaughter (1994-1996) and Brujeria (1997). Jensen was raised in Edmonton, until he was 10. Jensen received his first guitar when he was seven years old, but started playing when he was sixteen years old - he took guitar lessons for five years thereafter. Jensen plays his signature E1.6 Jensen from [1] and uses Engl amplification and EMG pick-ups (85/81). In 2013, Jensen played some live shows with In Flames for Niclas Engelin, when Engelin was unable to play, due to becoming a father." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patrik_Jensen> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Brown_(politician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Willie Lewis Brown Jr. (born March 20, 1934) is a retired American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as mayor of San Francisco from 1996 to 2004, the first African American to hold that office. Born in Mineola, Texas, where he graduated from high school, Brown moved to San Francisco in 1951. He graduated from San Francisco State University in 1995 and earned a J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1958, after which he worked as an attorney and was involved in the Civil rights movement. He was elected to the California Assembly in 1964, during which he became popular in San Francisco and became known as one of the country's most powerful state legislators. As a legislator, Brown earned a reputation as a supporter of civil rights of gays and lesbians and was able to manage colleagues and maintain party discipline. He served as the speaker of the California Assembly from 1980 to 1995. His long tenure and powerful position were used as a focal point of the California ballot proposition limiting the terms of state legislators that passed in 1990. During the last of his three allowed post-initiative terms, Brown maintained control of the Assembly despite a slim Republican majority. Near the end of his final term, he decided to run for mayor of San Francisco. During Brown's tenure as mayor of San Francisco, the city's budget was expanded, and real state development, public works, city beautification, and other city projects saw a significant increase. Brown presided over the \"dot-com\" era at a time when San Francisco's economy was rapidly expanding. His administration included more Asian-Americans, women, Latinos, gays and African-Americans than the administrations of his predecessors. Brown was reelected in 1999, but term limits prevented him from running for a third term, and he was succeeded by his political protégé Gavin Newsom. The San Francisco Chronicle called Brown \"one of San Francisco's most notable mayors\", adding that he had \"celebrity beyond the city's boundaries.\" He retired from politics after leaving the office in 2004, published an autobiography, and continued to fundraise and advise politicians." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Brown_(politician)> .

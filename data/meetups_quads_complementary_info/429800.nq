<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emir_Kusturica> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Emir Kusturica (Serbian Cyrillic: Емир Кустурица; born 24 November 1954) is a Serbian film director, screenwriter, actor, producer and musician. He also has French citizenship. Kusturica is one of the most-distinguished European filmmakers since the mid-1980s, best known for surreal and naturalistic movies that express deep sympathies for people from the margins. He has also been recognized for his projects in town-building. He has competed at the Cannes Film Festival on five occasions and won the Palme d'Or twice (for When Father Was Away on Business and Underground), as well as the Best Director prize for Time of the Gypsies. Kusturica has also won a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for Arizona Dream, a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival for Black Cat, White Cat and a Silver Lion for Best First Work for Do You Remember Dolly Bell?. In addition he was also named Commander of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Since the mid-2000s, Kusturica's primary residence has been in Drvengrad, a town built for his film Life Is a Miracle, in the Mokra Gora region of Serbia. He had portions of the historic village reconstructed for the film. He has been a member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republika Srpska since 9 November 2011. Among other accolades, Kusturica became a UNICEF ambassador in 2002 and eight years later he was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in France. He published an autobiography \"Smrt je neprovjerena glasina\" (“Death Is an Unverified Rumour”) in 2010, followed by a book of fiction, \"Sto jada\" (“Hundreds of Troubles”), in 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emir_Kusturica> .

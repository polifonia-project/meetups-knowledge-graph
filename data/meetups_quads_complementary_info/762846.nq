<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amerie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Amerie Mi Marie Nicholson (n√©e Rogers; born January 12, 1980) is an American singer and songwriter. Born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, she gained an appreciation of the classical arts from her mother Mi Suk Rogers and of music from her father Charles Rogers, and she also studied dance from an early age and performed in talent contests. After her high school graduation, her family settled down in Virginia while she began to attend Georgetown University, from which she later graduated with a degree in English and Fine Arts. While living in Washington, D.C., she met producer Rich Harrison, who worked with such performers as Mary J. Blige, and began developing demos with her. This led to a deal with Rise Entertainment and, in turn, major-label Columbia Records." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amerie> .

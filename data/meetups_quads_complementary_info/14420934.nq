<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Ryan_(catcher)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael James Ryan (November 25, 1941 – July 7, 2020) was an American professional baseball catcher who played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), before becoming a longtime coach as well as a minor league manager. He played for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates from 1964 to 1974. He batted and threw right-handed, stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 205 pounds (93 kg). He was a native of Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he graduated from St. James High School. Ryan was signed as an amateur free agent by the Red Sox in 1960 and played for four of their minor league affiliates until September 1964, when he was promoted from Double-A to the major leagues. After spending 21⁄2 full seasons with Boston, he was traded to the Phillies after the Red Sox' 1967 American League pennant-winning campaign. He appeared in 392 games for the Phils over the next six years before he was dealt to the Pirates in 1974. He played only 15 games as a Buc—his last on September 10 of that year—but would return to the Phillies as a bullpen coach for 16 seasons, beginning in their world championship 1980 season." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Ryan_(catcher)> .

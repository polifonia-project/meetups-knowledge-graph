<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Marriott> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen Peter Marriott (30 January 1947 â€“ 20 April 1991) was an English guitarist, singer and songwriter. He co-founded and played in the rock bands Small Faces and Humble Pie, in a career spanning over two decades. Marriott was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Small Faces. In Britain, Marriott became a popular, often-photographed mod style icon. Marriott was influenced by musicians such as: Miles Davis, Buddy Holly, Booker T & the MG's, Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Muddy Waters and Bobby Bland.In his later life Marriott became distant with the music industry and turned away from major record labels, remaining in relative obscurity. He returned to his music roots, playing in pubs and clubs around London and Essex. Marriott died on 20 April 1991 when a fire, which was thought to have been caused by a cigarette, swept through his 16th-century home in Arkesden, Essex. He was 44 and posthumously received an Ivor Novello Award in 1996 for his \"Outstanding Contribution to British Music\", and was listed in Mojo as one of the top 100 greatest singers of all time. Former Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne named Marriott the fourth-greatest singer ever and Clem Burke of Blondie ranked him the sixteenth. Paul Stanley of Kiss called Marriott \"unbelievable\" and a hero of his, while Steve Perry of Journey named him one of his favourite singers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Marriott> .

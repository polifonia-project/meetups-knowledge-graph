He joined the band Salvation with Midge Ure, which later became Slik and, after Ure's departure, some of the remaining members formed the Zones. He also went on to play with the Skids. In 1981, he joined Simple Minds, replacing Brian McGee. He contributed by recording \"Promised You a Miracle\" and appeared in the videos of \"Sweat in Bullet\" and \"Love Song\", from the Sons and Fascination album, which he did not appear on, but helped to promote. Following his departure from Simple Minds in 1982, Hyslop formed Set the Tone with bass player Bobby Paterson. Following the demise of Set the Tone, Hyslop formed the One O'Clock Gang which released an album on Arista Records. He went on to write songs for Les McKeown and also toured with Midge Ure on his The Gift World Tour 1985.

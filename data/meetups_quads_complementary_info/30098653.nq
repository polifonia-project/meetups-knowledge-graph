His early demo \"BTSTU\" led to his online discovery and a subsequent recording contract with XL Recordings. Together with its follow-up \"Jasmine\", these songs have been regarded as influential on underground as well as mainstream pop music in the 2010s. A demo album consisting of songs for his aborted debut album Bait Ones was leaked in 2013 and unofficially uploaded by an unknown source to the surprise and acclaim of critics, leading to Paul taking an extended hiatus from music. Paul returned in 2019 with the official release of his leaked album and a new double single entitled \"Do You Love Her Now / He\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jai_Paul> .

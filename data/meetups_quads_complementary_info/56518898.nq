<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Droomers> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dennis \"Seregor\" Droomers (born 27 October 1980) is a vocalist, guitarist, artist, and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist for Dutch symphonic black metal band, Carach Angren. The stage name \"Seregor\" comes from Tolkien's Silmarillion. It is a combination of the word sereg which means blood, and gor which means abhorrent. Before Carach Angren, Droomers played bass and was the vocalist for Inger Indolia from 1996-2001 and was the vocalist for Vaultage from 2003-2005 with fellow Carach Angren member Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers on keyboards. Carach Angren began as his and Wijers' side project while they were playing in Vaultage, because the two connected over a shared love of horror and storytelling. Later, Vaultage was disbanded as Carach Angren became increasingly successful. It is known that he grew up close to Schildveldse Bossen near where the focus of Lammendam took place. It is also known that he was primarily raised by his grandparents and is close to his grandmother who appears on the album art of This Is No Fairytale as the hand of the witch. Typically, Droomers writes Carach Angren's lyrics and stories while bandmate Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers writes the composition. Droomers also builds and sells masks, including customized commissions. He is self-taught and has never had any formal artistic education, nor has he had formal musical training. When asked about his artistic background he responded, \"just like guitar playing, extreme vocals, songwriting etc. I all sorted it out myself.\" His masks are frequently sold to fans through his website and Facebook page and Italian band Fleshgod Apocalypse has also used costume pieces made by Droomers. He also made all the gravestones in the \"Charles Francis Coghlan\" music video himself out of plaster and cardboard." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Droomers> .

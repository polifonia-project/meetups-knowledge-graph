<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Lamborn_Wilson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Lamborn Wilson (October 20, 1945 â€“ May 23, 2022) was an American anarchist author and poet, primarily known for his concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones, short-lived spaces which elude formal structures of control. During the 1970s, Wilson lived in the Middle East, where he explored mysticism and translated Persian texts. Starting from the 1980s he wrote (under the pen name of Hakim Bey) numerous political writings, illustrating his theory of \"ontological anarchy\". His style of anarchism has drawn criticism for its emphasis on individualism and mysticism, as did some of his writings where he defended pederasty." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Lamborn_Wilson> .

There the Red Cross had chartered a Japanese freighter, the 'Yomei Maru' to take them across the Pacific to Santa Barbara, CA., then across the U.S. by train to New York, then by ship to Brest, Belgium, then finally up to Finland to eventually be reunited with their parents and remaining families who met them at the land-bridge that connects Finland to Russia." ;

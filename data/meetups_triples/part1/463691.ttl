        mtp:hasEvidenceText  "It is worth mentioning that, even though \"Thousands of Songs\" was more popular, at least in terms of record sales, than \"Song of Sunset\" (夕陽之歌), the theme song for the 1989 Hong Kong film \"A Better Tomorrow III: Love & Death in Saigon\" (英雄本色III夕陽之歌) and another Cantopop classic released by Anita Mui in September 1989 in her album \"In Brasil\" with Cantonese lyrics written by Keith Chan (陳少琪) (lyricist of Chan's \"Night Flight\"),  \"Thousands of Songs\", the highly anticipated winner of the year's \"Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards: Gold Award\" (勁歌金曲頒獎典禮金曲金獎) presented by TVB, was lost to its counterpart \"Song of Sunset\" for the award, due to the closer commercial relations between TVB and Capital Artists (華星唱片), the label to which Mui was signed. Nonetheless, Chan's popularity was further promoted because of the album and elevated her to heights alongside peers including Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui; Chan was also awarded the \"Ultimate Female Singer: Bronze Award\" (叱咤樂壇女歌手銅獎) at the 1989 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation." ;

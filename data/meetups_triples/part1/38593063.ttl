It was only after an introduction to Suzanne Vega and similarly styled singer-songwriters during Marble's undergraduate tenure at Brown University that he first saw how these twin passions could be combined." ;

        mtp:hasEvidenceText  "The son of two Harvard, Massachusetts software engineers and nephew of science fiction novelist Piers Anthony, Leigh Marble is also the direct descendant of 19th century spiritualist Hiram Marble who spent years vainly searching for pirate's treasure that he believed lay buried within the abandoned cave of Dungeon Rock (now part of the Lynn Woods Reservation of eastern Massachusetts). Marble has maintained a lifelong fascination with the more macabre fringes of colonial history, and he has acknowledged that this obsessive interest in the \"spooky/gothic side of American folklore\" has substantially influenced his music." ;

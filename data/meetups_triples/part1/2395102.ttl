        mtp:hasEvidenceText  "According to him, the R&B of the early 1980s contained \"the perfect combination of computerized instrumentation with a live feel\", and that the genre's dynamics later became lost due to the influence of hip hop on R&B. Despite facing ridicule from classmates for being shy and awkward, he progressed and continued to develop his musical abilities, and he also adopted the look of a more bohemian style outwardly in his clothing, growing long sideburns and letting his hair grow out wildly and combed in an extreme style, or sometimes putting his hair in long thin braids." ;

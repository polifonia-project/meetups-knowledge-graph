Keough has resided with her father in Hawaii and Los Angeles, and with her mother in California and in Tennessee's Graceland. Keough made her feature film debut at age 20, appearing in a supporting part in the musical biopic The Runaways (2010), portraying Marie Currie. She subsequently starred in the independent thriller film The Good Doctor (2011) followed by the horror film Jack & Diane (2012), before being cast in a minor role in Steven Soderbergh's comedy film Magic Mike (2012). Keough appeared in several additional independent films in 2012, including Yellow and Kiss of the Damned, before appearing in the big-budget action feature Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), the fourth film in the Mad Max series. In 2016, Keough had her breakthrough role as a law student-turned-escort in the first season of the anthology series The Girlfriend Experience, executive-produced by Soderbergh and based on his 2009 film of the same name. She received critical praise for her role, and earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television. Keough's following performance as a wayward young woman in the drama American Honey (2016) earned her further acclaim, including an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female. The same year, Keough starred the apocalyptic horror film It Comes at Night (2017), and reunited with Soderbergh to appear in his heist film, Logan Lucky. She followed this with roles in a number of horror and thriller films in 2018, including Lars von Trier's The House That Jack Built, the neo-noir Under the Silver Lake, and Hold the Dark. In 2019, Keough starred as the lead in the psychological horror film The Lodge, followed by another leading role in the comedy-drama Zola (2020) and a supporting role in Netflix's The Devil All the Time (2020).

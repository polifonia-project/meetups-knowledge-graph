        mtp:hasAbstract        "Heather Eatman (born November 22, 1968 in Jacksonville, Texas, United States) is an American songwriter, singer, graphic artist, and portraitist, whose songs are \"Gothic character studies closer in spirit to the fiction of Flannery O'Connor than conventional folk music, complete with lyrics possessing a real flair for poetic physical imagery.\" She has recorded four full-length albums, Mascara Falls (1995), Candy and Dirt (1998), Real (2001), and Gorgeous Maze (2020) in addition to 2015 singles \"Angels in the Street,\" \"Soul Highway,\" \"Gold Ring,\" and 2020's \"Red Wine.\" Baby Teeth, an EP (extended play) consisting of new recordings of some of her earliest songs, also appeared in 2015. She was Managing Editor/Design at the New York Daily News, where she was employed from 1991 to 2012. Eatman has been called \"A gifted storyteller, whose casual narratives capture the seemingly settled fates of restless small-town dreamers and big-time losers, circus freaks and social geeks, with a bracing mix of compassion and detail.\" In May 2016, she produced \"Because the Night,\" a multi-artist tribute to the music and poetry of one of her formative influences, Patti Smith, at Brooklyn's Union Hall." ;

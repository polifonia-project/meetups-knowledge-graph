A grandson of the actors Robin and Angela Fox, and a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Fox first appeared in The Hole (2001) and thereafter in numerous films, television features, and theatre productions. He is also a singer-songwriter and guitarist; his debut album, Holding Patterns, was released in February 2016. Fox publicly opposed the George Floyd protests and opposed vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. After founding the Reclaim Party, Fox stood unsuccessfully in the 2021 London mayoral election in opposition to what he deemed \"extreme political correctness\". He gained 1.9% of the vote, losing his deposit." ;

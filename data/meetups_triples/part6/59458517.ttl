Prior to becoming Premier, succeeding Edward Richards, he served as Minister for Finance. In 1977, his government presented a discussion paper on independence for Bermuda. He later served as Minister of Labour and Home Affairs in the government of John Swan. First elected as MP for Warwick West in the House of Assembly in 1963, he retained the seat until he was defeated in the 1993 general election by Ewart Brown of the Progressive Labour Party. Following his death in 1999, a joint sitting of Parliament was held to pay respects to him." ;

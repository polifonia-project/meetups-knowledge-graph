        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Anthony Crispian Francis Prew Hope-Weston (11 July 1940 â€“ 6 March 2005), known professionally as Tommy Vance, was an English radio broadcaster. He was an important factor in the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM), along with London-based disc jockey Neal Kay, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Vance was one of the first radio hosts in the United Kingdom to broadcast hard rock and heavy metal in the early 1980s, providing the only national radio forum for both bands and fans. The Friday Rock Show that he hosted gave new bands airtime for their music and fans an opportunity to hear it. He used a personal tag-line of \"TV on the radio\". His voice was heard by millions around the world announcing the Wembley Stadium acts at Live Aid in 1985." ;

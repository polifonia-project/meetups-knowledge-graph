        mtp:hasAbstract        "Simon Munnery, also known as his characters \"Alan Parker: Urban Warrior\" and \"The League Against Tedium\", is an English comedian. He performs mainly to an alternative audience but has pierced the mainstream both with his BBC Radio 1 show in 1997 and his BBC2 television series Attention Scum! in 2001. His stand-up is often satirical and political and almost always surreal. Munnery's experimental style is reflected in his makeshift, often elaborate props. As \"The League\" he often wore a hat crafted from a kettle, epaulets that contained working model tanks, and shoes covered in roses. In Buckethead he played a character who performed the entire show with a metal bucket over his head." ;

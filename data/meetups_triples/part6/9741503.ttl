        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nicolas Vanier (born 5 May 1962) is a French adventurer, writer and director. His 2004 film The Last Trapper follows a trapper in Yukon, Canada. His film, (\"Wolf\") was released at the end of 2009 and was presented at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Loup is about the life of the Evens tribe in North Eastern arctic Siberia, in the Verkho√Øansk mountain range, who live by raising large herds of reindeer (caribou), which involves protecting them from attacks by wolves. In 2018, France Nature Environnement formally complained that a film crew overseen by Vanier had disturbed a colony of Greater Flamingoes, by repeatedly flying over them in an ultra-light aircraft, causing many - an estimated 11% of the total breeding population in France - to desert their nests and eggs." ;

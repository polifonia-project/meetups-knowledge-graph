        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eagle-Eye Lanoo Cherry (born 7 May 1968) is a Swedish singer and stage performer. His 1997 single \"Save Tonight\" achieved commercial success in Ireland, the United States and the United Kingdom, and was voted song of the year in New Zealand. Cherry is the son of American jazz artist Don Cherry and Swedish artist and designer Moki Cherry. He pursued acting during high school, though Cherry's acting career was eventually set aside as his musical career took precedence in his life with his debut album Desireless (1997). He has released several other albums since his debut, and has co-written for other artists and films, and has guest-starred on reality television. Cherry's music is of the acoustic, rock, post-grunge and alternative rock genres. He is fluent in both English and Swedish." ;

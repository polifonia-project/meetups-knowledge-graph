        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mary Marsha Blackburn (n√©e Wedgeworth; born June 6, 1952) is an American politician and businesswoman serving as the senior United States senator from Tennessee, a seat she has held since 2019. She is a member of the Republican Party. Blackburn was a state senator from 1999 to 2003, and represented Tennessee's 7th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2019, during which time The National Journal rated her among the House's most conservative members. On November 6, 2018, she became the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, defeating former Democratic Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen. She took over as the state's senior senator in January 2021, when outgoing Senator Lamar Alexander retired. Blackburn, a supporter of the Tea Party movement, is a staunch backer of former president Donald Trump." ;

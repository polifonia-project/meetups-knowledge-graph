        mtp:hasAbstract        "Amy Christine Dumas (/dʊˈmɑː/; born April 14, 1975), known professionally as Lita, is an American professional wrestler. Often regarded as one of the greatest women's performers, she is also one of the most popular female superstars in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2014. She is considered one of the icons of the Attitude Era. Initially using the name of Angelica, Dumas started her wrestling career in Mexico with the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in 1998, followed by briefly working on the US independent circuit in early 1999, and then working for 6 months in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Dumas then signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) in August 1999, debuting in February 2000 as Lita. Originally, she was paired with Essa Rios, but she achieved her greatest push alongside Matt and Jeff Hardy as Team Xtreme, and in 2005–2006 was a heel wrestler, including as a manager to Edge. She is a four-time WWE Women's Champion. After her first retirement in 2006, she formed the punk rock band The Luchagors. The band released their self-titled debut album on September 11, 2007." ;

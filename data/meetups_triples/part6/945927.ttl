Rodrigues Alves was elected the fifth president of Brazil in 1902 and served until 1906. During this term he remodeled the then Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro, an effort punctuated by the 1904 \"Vaccine Revolt\". He was elected president for a second term in 1918, but died in the influenza pandemic before assuming power, on 16 January 1919. He was succeeded by his vice-president, Delfim Moreira." ;

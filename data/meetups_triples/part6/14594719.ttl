        mtp:hasAbstract        "Steven Craig Morrison (born December 28, 1971) is a retired professional American football linebacker who played for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL) from 1995 to 1998. He is currently the associate head coach/linebackers coach at Bowling Green Falcons football. He previously served as the linebackers coach for the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team, on the coaching staff at Western Michigan, and as the linebackers coach at Syracuse Orange football. Prior to these professional experiences, he had excelled in college football as an All-Big Ten Conference inside linebacker from 1990 to 1994 for the Michigan Wolverines, whom he served as captain. In high school, he had been a Detroit Free Press first-team All-State (Michigan) and second-team All-Midwest selection in football and an All-American in lacrosse. After retiring from professional football as a player, he gained his first two years of coaching experience as the defensive coordinator for Michigan High School Athletic Association football champion Brother Rice High School (his high school alma mater). He then served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan for three years. He then assumed a role as an assistant at Western Michigan University. At Western Michigan, he has served as the linebacker coach after spending a year as the defensive line coach. The 2009 Western Michigan Broncos season marked Morrison's fifth season on the team's staff, his fourth as linebacker coach and his second as defensive coordinator. He then went on to serve as the linebackers coach at Eastern Michigan and Syracuse. In 2019, he was hired as the associate head coach/ linebackers coach at Bowling Green State University." ;

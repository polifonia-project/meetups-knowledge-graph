In 2001, Morrissey ran for Mayor against Doug Scott, a Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives.

In his second attempt in the 2005 election, Morrissey defeated Scott. In 2017, Morrissey did not run for re-election. As of 2019, he was Vice President of Government Relations and Vice President of Sales Midwest Region for Marathon Health." ;

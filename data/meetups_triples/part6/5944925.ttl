        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dayyan Eng, known as Wu Shixian in China (Chinese: 伍仕贤; pinyin: Wǔ Shìxían), born in Taiwan in 1975, is a Chinese-American filmmaker of Chinese, English, and Persian ancestry, who grew up in three continents. He studied film arts at the University of Washington and transferred to the Beijing Film Academy, where he finished his undergraduate studies in directing. Eng started his career directing numerous TV commercials and music videos for the Asian market before he segued into films. Eng first won awards and recognition at the Venice Film Festival, Sundance and Cannes film festivals for his film Bus 44, and for his acclaimed romantic-comedy Waiting Alone. Eng is the first American to direct a Chinese feature film; the first foreign director invited into the China Film Director’s Guild; and made history as the first and only foreign director to date to have a film nominated for Best Picture at the Chinese academy awards. In addition, Eng’s films have also garnered accolades and awards for the actors he’s worked with, which have included top stars in Asia and Hollywood." ;

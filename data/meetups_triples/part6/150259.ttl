        mtp:hasAbstract        "Meyer Lansky (born Maier Suchowljansky; July 4, 1902 â€“ January 15, 1983), known as the \"Mob's Accountant\", was an American organized crime figure who, along with his associate Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, was instrumental in the development of the National Crime Syndicate in the United States. A member of the Jewish mob, Lansky developed a gambling empire that stretched around the world. He was said to own points (percentages) in casinos in Las Vegas, Cuba, The Bahamas and London. Lansky additionally had a strong influence with the Italian-American Mafia and played a large role in the consolidation of the criminal underworld. The full extent of this role has been the subject of some debate, as Lansky himself denied many of the accusations against him. Despite nearly 50 years as a member/participant in organized crime, Lansky was never found guilty of anything more serious than illegal gambling. He has a legacy of being one of the most financially successful gangsters in American history. Before he fled Cuba, he was said to be worth an estimated $20 million (equivalent to $159 million in 2020). When he died in 1983, his family learned that his estate was worth around US$57,000 (equivalent to $155,079 in 2021)." ;

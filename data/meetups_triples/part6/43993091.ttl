        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dennis Robert Hoagland (April 2, 1884 â€“ September 5, 1949) was an American chemist and plant scientist working in the fields of plant nutrition, agricultural chemistry, and physiology. He was Professor of Plant Nutrition at the University of California at Berkeley from 1927 until his death in 1949. Hoagland is commonly known for discovering the active transport of nutrients in plants, using innovative model systems under controlled experimental conditions, such as solution culture. He and his colleagues formulated an artificial, complete inorganic nutrient medium, universally known as Hoagland solution, that is still widely used for culturing plants hydroponically." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harold Clayton Lloyd, Sr. (April 20, 1893 â€“ March 8, 1971) was an American actor, comedian, and stunt performer who appeared in many silent comedy films. One of the most influential film comedians of the silent film era, Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and \"talkies\", between 1914 and 1947. His bespectacled\"Glass\" character was a resourceful, ambitious go-getter who matched the zeitgeist of the 1920s-era United States. His films frequently contained \"thrill sequences\" of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (dangerous, but risk exaggerated by camera angles) in Safety Last! (1923) is considered one of the most enduring images in cinema. Lloyd performed lesser stunts himself, despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove, and was almost undetectable on the screen)." ;

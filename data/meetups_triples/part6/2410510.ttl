        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jonathan William Coulton (born December 1, 1970), often called \"JoCo\" by fans, is an American folk/comedy singer-songwriter, known for his songs about geek culture and his use of the Internet to draw fans. Among his most popular songs are \"Code Monkey\", \"Re: Your Brains\", \"Still Alive\" and \"Want You Gone\" (the last three being featured in games developed by Valve: Left 4 Dead 2, Portal, and Portal 2 respectively). He was the house musician for NPR weekly puzzle quiz show Ask Me Another from 2012 until its end in 2021. His album Artificial Heart was the first to chart, eventually reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers and No. 125 in the Billboard 200." ;

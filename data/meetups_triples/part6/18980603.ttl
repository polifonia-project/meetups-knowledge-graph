Together with his sister Laura and brothers Pete and Todd, the Ricketts siblings serve as the board of directors for the Cubs. He is the son of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation founder J. Joseph Ricketts. Joe Ricketts has a net worth of US$2.3 billion as of 2018 according to Forbes. In January 2009, a Ricketts family bid led by Tom emerged as the winning bidder for the Chicago Cubs. The bid was estimated to total around $900 million for the team and related assets. In October 2009, the sale was approved unanimously by the owners of the other 29 Major League Baseball teams. Ricketts was introduced as the chairman of the Cubs on October 31, 2009. Tom Ricketts and his three siblings - Peter, Laura, and Todd share ownership of the team through their family trust." ;

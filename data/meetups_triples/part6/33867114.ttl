It was signed by Governor Paul LePage in June 2011. Mason was re-elected in 2012 by 28 votes over Democrat of Minot. In June 2013, upon news that incumbent Congressman Mike Michaud had taken steps towards running for governor, Mason was said to be \"seriously considering a run\" for the Republican nomination. After Republicans took control of the Maine Senate in 2014, Mason was elected Senate Majority Leader, a position he held until he termed out in 2018." ;

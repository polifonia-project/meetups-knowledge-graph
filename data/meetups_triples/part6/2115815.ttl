        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lynd Kendall Ward (June 26, 1905 â€“ June 28, 1985) was an American artist and novelist, known for his series of wordless novels using wood engraving, and his illustrations for juvenile and adult books. His wordless novels have influenced the development of the graphic novel. Although strongly associated with his wood engravings, he also worked in watercolor, oil, brush and ink, lithography and mezzotint. Ward was a son of Methodist minister, political organizer and radical social activist Harry F. Ward, the first chairman of the American Civil Liberties Union on its founding in 1920. His best-known books are Gods' Man and his Caldecott-winning children's story, The Biggest Bear." ;

In 2012, Regan founded Operation Song, a program which brings professional songwriters together with veterans and active duty military to help them tell their stories in song. To date there have been over 1200 songs written with veterans of World War II to those currently serving. Regan has also been a studio musician, a guitarist on the Grand Ole Opry (with Jeanne Pruitt,) and was a three-term President of the Board of the Nashville Songwriters Association International as well as their Legislative Chair. In that role in 2006, he helped pass the Songwriters Capital Gains Tax Equity Act.

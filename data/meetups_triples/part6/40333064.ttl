Projects by directors John Carpenter and Joseph Zito, and musicians Ray Manzarek and Diamanda Gal√°s have incorporated his work. In addition to composing, he frequently appears in films he is involved in, usually made up as a demon or other supernatural creature. He has also been a producer on Repo! The Genetic Opera and other projects." ;

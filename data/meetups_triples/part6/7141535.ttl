In 1935 Munz published his Manual of Southern California Botany. Munz compiled the voluminous with David D. Keck, published by the University of California Press in 1959, and with a supplement published in 1968. Munz published A California Flora without any research support and with a relatively small subvention for publication from the University of California Press. In 1974, his book A Flora of Southern California was published posthumously, with the botanical families presented in an alphabetical order." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Bruce Ferguson (December 30, 1927 â€“ July 22, 2001) was an American country music songwriter and record producer who was instrumental in establishing Nashville, Tennessee as a center of country music. He was also a movie producer, and Choctaw Indian historian. Ferguson is best known for writing the bestselling songs \"On the Wings of a Dove\" and \"The Carroll County Accident\". The \"Carroll County Accident\" won the Country Music Association Song of the Year in 1969. In 1983 \"Wings of a Dove\" was featured in the movie Tender Mercies starring Robert Duvall. In 1987, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) awarded Ferguson with the \"million air\" plays for the \"Wings of a Dove.\" The country song \"Carroll County Accident\", recorded by Porter Wagoner, made No. 2 on the Billboard country singles chart (No. 92 pop) and No. 1 on the Cash Box country singles chart. The tune was also recorded by Wagoner's longtime duet partner Dolly Parton. Ferguson married twice, first to Harvie June Van (1950s/60s) then to Martha Jean Lewis (1970 to 2001)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christopher Adams (10 February 1955 â€“ 7 October 2001), best known as \"Gentleman\" Chris Adams, was an English professional wrestler, wrestling promoter, trainer, and judoka. By age 21, he was a three-time British National Judo Champion in his age and weight classes. In professional wrestling, Adams gained his greatest success in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), where he became the promotion's World Heavyweight Champion and one of its biggest stars. He also performed for companies such as World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA), where he held the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) Light Heavyweight Championship. All told, he held 26 titles over a 23-year career. Adams is known for training wrestlers such as Stone Cold Steve Austin and Scott Hall (Razor Ramon), and for popularizing the superkick finishing move, which was later used by many other performers." ;

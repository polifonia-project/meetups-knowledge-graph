        mtp:hasAbstract        "Griselda Gambaro (born 24 July 1928) is an Argentine writer, whose novels, plays, short stories, story tales, essays and novels for teenagers often concern the political violence in her home country that would develop into the Dirty War. One recurring theme is the desaparecidos and the attempts to recover their bodies and memorialize them. Her novel Ganarse la muerte was banned by the government because of the obvious political message. Gambaro is a celebrated playwright, and she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1982, as well as many other prizes." ;

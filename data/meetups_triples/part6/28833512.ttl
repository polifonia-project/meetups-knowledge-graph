Grimm represented New York's 13th congressional district during his first term, after which he represented New York's 11th congressional district. Both districts consisted of Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn. Grimm is a member of the Republican Party, and during his time in office was the only Republican to represent a significant portion of New York City. On April 28, 2014, Grimm was charged by federal authorities with 20 counts of fraud, federal tax evasion, and perjury. On December 23, 2014, he pleaded guilty to a single count of felony tax fraud, and \"acknowledged committing perjury, hiring illegal immigrants, and committing wire fraud\". After initially vowing to retain his seat, Grimm announced on December 30, 2014, that he would resign from Congress effective January 5, 2015. On May 5, 2015, Daniel M. Donovan Jr. won the special election to replace Grimm. On July 17, 2015, Grimm was sentenced to eight months in prison for tax evasion. He began his prison term on September 22, 2015 after a brief delay for medical treatments. On October 1, 2017, Grimm launched a campaign to attempt to win back his old House seat in the 11th district. On June 26, 2018, he lost in the Republican primary." ;

He appeared alongside Hazel O'Connor in the film Breaking Glass (1980) as bass guitarist Dave. Tibbs was born in Northwood, London.

At various times he was a member of Zu Zu Sharks, Code Blue, The Believers, Roxy Music, The Vibrators and The Fixx. He first played on The Fixx's 2003 album, Want That Life. Tibbs also played on selected tracks on Brian Mayâ€™s 1993 solo album Back to the Light. He also formed a band called Merrick and Tibbs with Chris Hughes (a.k.a.

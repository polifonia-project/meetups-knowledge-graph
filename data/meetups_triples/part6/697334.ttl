        mtp:hasAbstract        "Norman Hunter (29 October 1943 â€“ 17 April 2020) was an English footballer who played for Leeds United, Bristol City, Barnsley and England. He was part of the 1966 FIFA World Cup winning squad, receiving a winner's medal in 2007. He was the first winner of the PFA Players' Player of the Year award in 1974, and was included in the Football League 100 Legends. A tough tackling centre-half and defensive midfielder, he was nicknamed \"Bites Yer Legs\" Hunter. The nickname originated from a banner held up by Leeds United fans at the 1972 FA Cup Final against Arsenal; the banner read \"Norman bites yer legs\". He played 726 games in total for Leeds, scoring 21 goals." ;

Graham was a semiprofessional baseball player. Graham entered the film business in 1928. He was a charter member of the Screen Actors Guild. He appeared in Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). He broke his ankle while working as Basil Rathbone's stunt double on The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Graham coordinated stunts of John Wayne, with whom he made 26 films; Errol Flynn; and Ward Bond. He played small roles in two Alfred Hitchcock films, notably Vertigo, as the Police Officer who falls to his death in its famous opening scene while trying to help James Stewart. He continued working in films until the 1970s. Graham moved to Arizona in 1963.

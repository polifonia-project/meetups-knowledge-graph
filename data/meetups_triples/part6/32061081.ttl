        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frans Christiaan Frederiks (born 12 November 1980), known by his stage name Lange Frans, is a Dutch rapper and television presenter. From 1997 to 2004 he was a member of the band D-Men. Between 1997 and 2009 he was part of the Lange Frans & Baas B duo before starting a solo career. In 2019 the duo reformed and made a few appearances, but in April 2021 Baas B returned with a solo album, claiming that he and Frederiks were no longer on the same page \"in terms of message\". Starting in 2008, Lange Frans worked for the Dutch television station Veronica presenting programs including My Best Friends, Veronica Poker, TelSell, Lange Frans stelt Kamervragen, Fobiac and Face It!. Since 2020, Frederiks has produced a podcast in which he disseminates fake news and conspiracy theories." ;

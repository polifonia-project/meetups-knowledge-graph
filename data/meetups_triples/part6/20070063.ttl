Born in Bandung, Indonesia of Chinese Indonesian parents, Halim made his public debut at the age of 11 playing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3. A student of Sascha Gorodnitzki and Rudolf Firkušný at the Juilliard School where he attended on full scholarship, Halim later studied with Vladimir Horowitz, to whom he was recommended by Harold C. Schonberg and David Dubal. His experience working with the late maestro is documented in Schonberg's book, Horowitz: His Life and Music. He won 4th prize at the 1985 Sydney International Piano Competition, and 3rd prize at the 1988 competition. Halim began his international concert career in 1989 after winning the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. He is the inaugural holder of the Sascha Gorodnitzki Chair in Piano Studies and a member of the Artist Faculty at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development." ;

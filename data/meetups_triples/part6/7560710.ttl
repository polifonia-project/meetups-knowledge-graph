        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hiroshi Yamazaki (Japanese: 山崎 博, Hepburn: Yamazaki Hiroshi, 21 September 1946 – 5 June 2017) was a Japanese photographer whose works concentrate on the sun and the sea. Born in Nagano on 21 September 1946, Yamazaki studied at Nihon University but dropped out in 1968, starting out as a freelance cameraman a year later, working in both still photography and 16mm film. Yamazaki is best known for two series. \"Heliography\" uses long exposures to show the path of the sun near the horizon. \"Horizon\" (Suiheisen saishū) is a study of sea horizons. Yamazaki won the 26th Ina Nobuo Award in 2001. Yamazaki became a full professor at Tohoku University of Art and Design in 1993, and also taught at Musashino Art University and TPO Photo School. He died on 5 June 2017 of cancer of the gums." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "George \"Fowokan\" Kelly (born 1 April 1943) is a Jamaican-born visual artist who lives in Britain and exhibits using the name \"Fowokan\" (a Yoruba word meaning: \"one who creates with the hand\"). He is a largely self-taught artist, who has been practising sculpture since 1980. His work is full of the ambivalence he sees in the deep-rooted spiritual and mental conflict between the African and the European. Fowokan's work is rooted in the traditions of pre-colonial Africa and ancient Egypt rather than the Greco-Roman art of the west. He has also been a jeweller, essayist, poet and musician (a former member of the funk group Cymande in the early 1970s)." ;

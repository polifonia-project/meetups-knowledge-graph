Al Jassmi was born in Khorfakkan in August 1979 to Emirati parents. He released his first single \"Bawada'ak\" followed by \"Wallah Mayiswa\" and \"Bassbour Al Fourgakom\". In 2008, Al Jassmi received the Murex d'Or award, under the category of \"Best Arabic Male Singer.\" His most popular song is an Egyptian Shaabi song, called \"Boshret Kheir\", written and composed by Amr Mostafa as a pro-elections campaign in Egypt. Al Jassmi had many concerts all around the world. One of his well known performances include a performance in the Vatican's annual Christmas concert, becoming the first Arab to do so.

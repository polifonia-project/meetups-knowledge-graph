He was best known for presenting an afternoon radio show on London's Capital London from 1973 until 1988 and was also best known for presenting his late night Sunday show, Scott on Sunday on BBC Radio 1 until his death from cancer. Born in London in 1943, Roger Scott developed an early love of the rock and roll music being created at the end of the 1950s and early 1960s. As a teenager, he began playing records out the window of his suburban London home and watching the reaction of passers-by to the music." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Low Taek Jho (Chinese: 劉特佐; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Lâu Te̍k-chó͘, born 4 November 1981), often called Jho Low, is a Malaysian fugitive businessman, wanted by authorities internationally in connection with the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal (1MDB scandal). He has been named the mastermind of the massive fraud, which prosecutors allege was a scheme to siphon US$4.5 billion from 1MDB into Low's personal accounts. He is the beneficiary of numerous discretionary trust assets said by the US government to originate from payments out of the Malaysian 1MDB fund. Low has stated that he \"will not submit to any jurisdiction where guilt has been predetermined by politics and where there is no independent legal process\", maintaining his innocence throughout the 1MDB scandal. He contends that Malaysian authorities are engaging in a campaign of harassment and political persecution due to his prior support of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose part in the 1MDB scandal had led to Najib being convicted on seven counts of abuse of power, money laundering and criminal breach of trust." ;

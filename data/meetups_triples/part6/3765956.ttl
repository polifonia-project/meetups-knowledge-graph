        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stanley \"Stan\" Taylor Adams (May 9, 1922 â€“ April 19, 1999) was a United States Army officer who received the U.S. military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions in the Korean War. A native of Kansas, Adams fought in World War II as an enlisted soldier. He was sent to Korea as a sergeant soon after the outbreak of war there, and was awarded the Medal of Honor for leading a bayonet charge against a numerically superior force in early 1951. Commissioned as an officer shortly after receiving the medal, Adams continued to serve into the Vietnam War, eventually retiring as a lieutenant colonel." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Perry Gilbert Eddy Miller (February 25, 1905 â€“ December 9, 1963) was an American intellectual historian and a co-founder of the field of American Studies. Miller specialized in the history of early America, and took an active role in a revisionist view of the colonial Puritan theocracy that was cultivated at Harvard University beginning in the 1920s. Heavy drinking led to his premature death at the age of 58. \"Perry Miller was a great historian of Puritanism but the dark conflicts of the Puritan mind eroded his own mental stability.\"" ;

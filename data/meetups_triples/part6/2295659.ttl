        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eddie Jefferson (August 3, 1918 â€“ May 9, 1979) was an American jazz vocalist and lyricist. He is credited as an innovator of vocalese, a musical style in which lyrics are set to an instrumental composition or solo. Jefferson himself claims that his main influence was Leo Watson. Perhaps Jefferson's best-known song is \"Moody's Mood for Love\" which was recorded in 1952, though two years later a recording by King Pleasure catapulted the contrafact into wide popularity (King Pleasure even cites Jefferson as a personal influence). Jefferson's recordings of Charlie Parker's \"Parker's Mood\" and Horace Silver's \"Filthy McNasty\" were also hits." ;

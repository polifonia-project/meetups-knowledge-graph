        mtp:hasAbstract        "Somei Satoh (佐藤 聰明, Satō Sōmei, born January 19, 1947 in Sendai, Japan) is a Japanese composer of contemporary music. His compositions mix Japanese court music with European romanticism and electronic music. His musical career began with an experimental, mix media group called \"Tone Field\" in Tokyo. He studied at Nihon University of Art in the early 1970s and is primarily self-taught in composition. In 1972 and 1981, Satoh produced two other experimental projects, the latter involved placing eight speakers approximately one kilometer apart on nearby mountain tops overlooking a huge valley. In 1985, he collaborated with theater designer Manuel Luetgenhorst to stage his music at The Arts at St. Ann's in Brooklyn, New York. He wrote his violin concerto for Anne Akiko Meyers. He currently lives in Tokyo." ;

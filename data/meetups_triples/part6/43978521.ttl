        mtp:hasAbstract        "Miriam Weeks, known by her stage name of Belle Knox, is an American former pornographic film actress. She is known for performing in pornography while studying at Duke University. Knox started doing pornography in 2013 to help pay for her $60,000 per year tuition costs. In late 2013, her career became publicly known on campus, and she faced extensive in-person and online harassment. Knox took a college-sanctioned break from Duke University in early 2014 and later returned to continue her studies. Knox has publicly defended her decision to do the work, as well as explained her views of feminism and rights for sex workers. She believes her experiences are indicative of the rising costs of higher education in the United States. Knox has won a 2014 Fanny Award and a 2015 XBIZ Award." ;

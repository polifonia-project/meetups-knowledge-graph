According to Adam of Bremen, his body was buried in Birka, but his head was entombed in Bremen Cathedral. When the altar was taken down in 1840, a leaden plate was found with the inscription \"VNNIS ARCHIEP(is)-C(opus)\". After Ansgar and Rimbert of Turholt, epithetised Apostle of the North and second Apostle of the North, Unni is revered as third Apostle of the North and as Saint." ;

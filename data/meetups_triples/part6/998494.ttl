        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Mark Nestor CM (/ˈnɛstər/ NES-tər; Serbian: Данијел Нестор, romanized: Danijel Nestor; born September 4, 1972) is a Canadian former professional tennis player. Nestor won 91 men's doubles titles (with 11 different partners), including an Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, four Tour Finals titles, and twelve major doubles titles attained with seven different partners (eight in men's doubles and four in mixed doubles). Nestor was the first man in history to win every major and Masters event, the Tour Finals, and an Olympic gold medal, an achievement since matched by the Bryan brothers. He was part of the ATP Doubles Team of the Year in 2002 and 2004 (with Mark Knowles), and 2008 (with Nenad Zimonjić). Nestor became the world No. 1 doubles player for the first time in August 2002. Nestor is widely considered one of the foremost doubles players in history, due to his longevity and continued success at the top of the game. As of March 2018, he is 10th for the most ATP Tour titles in Open Era history, and has the third-highest tally for doubles titles. In January 2016, Nestor became the first doubles player in ATP history to win 1000 matches. He was continuously ranked in the top 100 in doubles from April 1994 to April 2018, a total of 1134 consecutive weeks. Nestor retired at the end of the 2018 season, ending a 27-year career." ;

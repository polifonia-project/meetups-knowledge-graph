        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ashikaga Yoshizumi (足利 義澄, January 15, 1481 – September 6, 1511) was the 11th shōgun of the Ashikaga shogunate who reigned from 1494 to 1508 during the Muromachi period of Japan. He was the son of Ashikaga Masatomo and grandson of the sixth shōgun Ashikaga Yoshinori. His childhood name was Seikō (清晃), Yoshizumi was first called Yoshitō (sometimes translated as Yoshimichi), then Yoshitaka. Yoshizumi was adopted by the 8th shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa. He was installed by Hosokawa Masamoto as Sei-i Taishōgun. He was stripped of the title in 1508 by the 10th shōgun Ashikaga Yoshitane, who became shōgun for a second period of time. Two of Yoshizumi's sons would themselves become shōguns. Ashikaga Yoshiharu would hold nominal powers as the twelfth Muromachi shōgun; and Ashikaga Yoshihide assumed nominal powers as the fourteenth shōgun." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Monique Edith Lamoureux-Morando (born July 3, 1989), previously known as Monique Lamoureux-Kolls, is a former American ice hockey player, author, gender equity advocate, and co-founder of the Lamoureux Foundation. She scored the game-tying goal in the final of the 2018 Winter Olympics before her twin sister Jocelyne scored the last shootout goal of the game to clinch the gold medal. She also captured silver medals for Team USA at the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics. She competed for a year with the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association, a worker's union pushing for equality in the sport, and retired from playing in 2021. After her retirement, Monique and her twin sister published their first book Dare to Make History. The sisters also founded the Lamoureux Foundation, which funds educational and extracurricular programs for children in need, primarily in their home state of North Dakota." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Theodore Eliot Deutch (/dɔɪtʃ/ DOYTCH; born May 7, 1966) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the U.S. representative from Florida's 22nd congressional district from 2010 to 2022. His district, numbered as the 19th district from 2010 to 2013 and as the 21st from 2013 to 2017, included much of northern Broward County and southern Palm Beach County in South Florida. A member of the Democratic Party, he first entered Congress in 2010 after a special election following the resignation of Robert Wexler. Deutch chaired the House Ethics Committee from 2019 until his resignation, a position in which he succeeded Susan Brooks. He served as the Florida state senator from the 30th district from 2006 to 2010. On February 28, 2022, Deutch announced he would not seek reelection in the 2022 United States House of Representatives elections, instead taking a job as chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee by October 1, 2022. On September 30, 2022, Deutch resigned from the House." ;

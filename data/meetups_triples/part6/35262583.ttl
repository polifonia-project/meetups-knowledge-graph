        mtp:hasAbstract        "Patrick Alan Corbin (born July 19, 1989) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Arizona Diamondbacks. He won the 2019 World Series with the Nationals. At Cicero â€“ North Syracuse High School, Corbin did not pitch for his high school's baseball team until his junior season. He played college baseball at Mohawk Valley Community College and Chipola College. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim chose Corbin in the second round of the 2009 MLB draft, and traded him to the Diamondbacks in 2010 as part of a package for Dan Haren. Corbin made his MLB debut with the Diamondbacks in 2012, and was named an All-Star in 2013. He missed the 2014 season due to an injury to the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. Corbin returned to the Diamondbacks in 2015, but struggled, and was removed from the starting rotation in 2016. After returning to the rotation in 2017, he started for the Diamondbacks on Opening Day in 2018. Corbin was named an All-Star for the second time in his career in 2018 before joining the Washington Nationals for the 2019 season." ;

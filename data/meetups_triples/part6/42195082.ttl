Hill was selected by the Republican Caucus as the House Majority Whip of the Tennessee House of Representatives on February 1, 2016, following the resignation of Republican Representative Jeremy Durham who stepped down as House Majority Whip and later withdrew from the House GOP caucus amid allegations of sexual harassment of women at the Tennessee State Capitol and other questionable behaviors. Hill reportedly stated in a speech to his fellow caucus members before his selection as House Majority Whip that he wanted \"offer a pathway to healing\" to the House Republican caucus." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Leonard Young (October 17, 1917 â€“ August 30, 1987) was an American sportswriter best known for his direct and abrasive style, and his 45-year association with the New York Daily News. He was elected to the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978, and was a former president of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Young was the first sportswriter to treat the clubhouse as a central and necessary part of the sports \"beat\", and his success at ferreting out scoops and insights from within the previously private sanctum of the team was influential and often imitated. The Boston Globe's Bob Ryan said of Young, \"He's the guy that broke ground, the guy who went into the locker room, and that changed everything.\" A self-professed Republican, Young sided frequently with owners of professional sports teams engaging in public contractual debates with players, most notoriously in 1977 when he described Mets ace pitcher Tom Seaver, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, as \"a pouting, griping, morale-breaking clubhouse lawyer.\" In 2000, Ira Berkow chose Young as one of the seven sportswriters who'd made the greatest impact on their profession, along with Red Smith, Grantland Rice, Ring Lardner, Damon Runyon, Jimmy Cannon, and Jim Murray. According to in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Young was a \"key transitional figure\" between the \"gentlemanly\" sports reporting of old-time writers like Grantland Rice and Arthur Daley. Upon his death, The New York Times described Young's prose style: \"With all the subtlety of a knee in the groin, Dick Young made people gasp... He could be vicious, ignorant, trivial and callous, but for many years he was the epitome of the brash, unyielding yet sentimental Damon Runyon sportswriter.\" Esquire called Young's writing \"coarse and simpleminded, like a cave painting. But it is superbly crafted.\" wrote that Young had \"singlehandedly replaced the pompous poetry of the press box with the cynical poetry of the streets.\" In his book The Boys of Summer, Roger Kahn called Young \"spiky, self-educated, and New York.\" Characteristically, Young described his approach to sportswriting simply: \"Tell people what's going on, and what you think is going on. Bread-and-butter stuff, meat-and-potato stuff.\"" ;

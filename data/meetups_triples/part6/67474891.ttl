In 2008, he scored Far Cry 2, and in 2020, he composed the film score to I Care A Lot, for which he received an ASCAP award. Canham has collaborated with several artists including Iggy Pop, Nathan Johnson, Philip Glass, Baaba Maal, Bryan Mantia, and Paul Hartnoll. On creating music, Canham stated that he wanted to deliver emotion through a \"sound palette\" of combinations of sounds, textures, and ensembles of instruments, then letting loose with melodies and motifs. For I Care A Lot, Canham claims to have created the score from the script, as opposed to the film." ;

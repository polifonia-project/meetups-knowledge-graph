        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lois Walden (born February 8, 1946) is an American author, singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, performer & teaching artist for The Acting Company. She is the author of two novels: One More Stop, a 2012 finalist for the Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Debut Fiction and Waterstones New Voices finalist, and Afterworld published in 2013 in the UK and in May 2014 in the US by Arcadia Books. Walden is also a teaching artist for The Acting Company in New York, and devotes part of each year working in inner city schools, and other artistically deprived populations, educating teachers, students and audiences about process drama & creativity. In 1994, Walden co-created, directed, co-wrote, and hosted the inaugural season of SongmastersInsideOut, a thirteen-week series of live performances at the Algonquin Hotel's Oak Room celebrating the great masters of songwriting and the stars who made their music famous. As a singer, songwriter and record producer Walden has made three record albums: Walden which featured Walden as a solo performer, Traveler [Discovery Records - 77073-2] on which she performed and wrote or co-wrote many of the songs, and Good News in Hard Times on which she sang as a member of the Gospel group Sisters of Glory. The Sisters of Glory, comprising Thelma Houston, CeCe Peniston, Phoebe Snow, Walden and Albertina Walker, performed at Woodstock '94. The album, produced by Jennifer Cohen in collaboration with Walden, earned positive reviews from music critics, including Entertainment Weekly. Good News in Hard Times charted on the U.S. Billboard Top 40 Gospel Albums at number 29. Lois Walden is also the co-librettist (with Jeane Claude van Itallie) on a 2018 opera, MILA: Great Sorcerer, showcasing January 2019 as part of New York's Prototype Festival." ;

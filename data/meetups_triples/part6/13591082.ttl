        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Ozn (born Robert Mitchell Warfield Frank Rosen, April 24, 1964 New York City) -- A Top 5 Billboard USA & Top 10 Music Week UK singer/rapper/writer/producer, he has also recorded under the monikers \"DaDa NaDa\" and \"OZN\" (pronounced OH zen), often times integrating social and political themes into commercially successful works. He first attained world wide recognition on MTV as the vocal half of 1980s New York City synthpop duo EBN-OZN, widely credited as the creators of the first-ever commercially charted record produced on a computer and the first \"white rap\" record to chart mainstream. After a long absence from the music industry working behind the camera, in 2016 Robert \"Dada Nada\" Ozn released his first single in 25 years achieving major chart comebacks and press coverage in both the US & UK resuming a recording career which continues at this time. Also a screenwriter/film producer and Broadway actor (early career credits as \"Robert Rosen\"), he is best known for his work as writer/producer (with former Sony Vice-President Colin Greene) of the award-winning, human rights-themed feature film I Witness starring Jeff Daniels, James Spader and Portia de Rossi. He is also a prominent American bisexual activist having served as the Chair of the Los Angeles Bi Task Force." ;

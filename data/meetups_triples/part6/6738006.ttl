        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nektaria Karantzi (Greek: Νεκταρία Καραντζή; born 5 August 1982 in Greece) is a Byzantine and traditional singer from Greece. Her voice has been identified mainly with the Byzantine sacred art and has been regarded as one of the most important voices in Byzantine Chant. She is the unique Greek performer of Byzantine music, with a discography in this music since she was fourteen, and with active work of chanting as a chorister in church since she was nine. Her performances in concert halls in Greece and abroad are purely devoted to Byzantine Chant and she has been internationally acclaimed as the most ideal performer of Byzantine Melos (chanting) and of the Primeval Tradition." ;

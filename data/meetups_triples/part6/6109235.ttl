        mtp:hasAbstract        "Wes Avi Littleton (born September 2, 1982) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher who spent his entire three-year playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Texas Rangers (2006–2008). He is noted for being credited with a save after pitching the final three scoreless innings in a 30–3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the first game of a two-night doubleheader at Camden Yards on August 22, 2007. The final 27-run differential broke the previous MLB record of 19 for largest winning margin for a save. The New York Times noted that \"there are the preposterous saves, of which Littleton's now stands out as No. 1.\"" ;

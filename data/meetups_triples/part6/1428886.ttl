Graham built buildings all over the world and was deeply involved with evolving the Burnham Plan of Chicago. Among his most notable buildings are the Inland Steel Building, the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), and the John Hancock Center. He was also responsible for planning the Broadgate and Canary Wharf developments in London. Architectural historian Franz Schulze called him \"the Burnham of his generation.\" He was a 1993 Pew Fellow." ;

She is an Ivor Novello Award winner who has earned critical acclaim in dozens of music magazines both in the UK and the US, including Folk Album of the Year from The Sunday Times. Howe began an acting career in the late 1960s, and has since gained a following in folk music: Record Collector in 2007 called her \"one of the great unrecognised voices\". Observer Music in 2007 said \"Catherine Howe was a Kate Bush before her time\"." ;

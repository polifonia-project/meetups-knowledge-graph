        mtp:hasAbstract        "Vernon George \"Tod\" Handley CBE (11 November 1930 â€“ 10 September 2008) was a British conductor, known in particular for his support of British composers. He was born of a Welsh father and an Irish mother into a musical family in Enfield, Middlesex. He acquired the nickname \"Tod\" because his feet were turned in at his birth, which his father simply summarised: \"They toddle\". Handley preferred the use of the name \"Tod\" throughout his life over his given names." ;

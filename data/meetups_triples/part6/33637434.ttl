        mtp:hasAbstract        "Masatoshi Ono (小野正利, Ono Masatoshi, born January 29, 1967 in Adachi, Tokyo, Japan), also known as Sho, is a Japanese rock/heavy metal singer-songwriter and vocal coach. Ono got his start in the 1980s as vocalist of the heavy metal band Fort Bragg. In 1992, he released his first solo single, \"Pure ni Nare\", on Sony Records. It was not until his third single, \"You're the Only...\", that he began to receive notable attention. The single helped Ono win the \"Rookie of the Year\" award at the 34th Japan Record Awards and an invitation to that year's Kōhaku Uta Gassen. In 2009, Ono became the vocalist of the power metal band Galneryus. His first single in eight years, \"Departure!\", was used as the opening theme song for the 2011 Hunter × Hunter anime. \"Departure! -Second Version-\" was used as the series' second opening theme, with Galneryus' \"Hunting for Your Dream\" as the second ending theme. Ono sings \"Fight It Out!!\", the opening theme song for the international versions of the final arc of Dragon Ball Kai. In 2010 he established his own vocal school \"Bese\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eric Michael Surkamp (born July 16, 1987) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who played for the San Francisco Giants, Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Oakland Athletics from 2011 to 2016. He also pitched for the Hanwha Eagles of the KBO League in 2016. Surkamp batted and threw left-handed with his fastball averaging 89 miles per hour (143 km/h). Growing up, Surkamp helped Moeller High School become Ohio state baseball champions in 2004. He played college baseball at North Carolina State University (NC State) and was a member of Team USA in 2007. Drafted by the Giants in the sixth round in the 2008 MLB Draft, he was called up in August 2011 after posting a 2.02 earned run average (ERA), which led the Eastern League. He had a 2–2 record with the Giants and was considered a fringe candidate for the team's Opening Day roster in 2012, though he wound up missing that season due to Tommy John surgery. He made only one start for the Giants in 2013, allowing seven runs in 2+2⁄3 innings. in a 9–3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Following the year, Surkamp was claimed off waivers by the White Sox. Used exclusively as a relief pitcher by them in 2014, he appeared in 35 games, posting a 4.81 ERA. He failed to make their roster in 2015 and was traded to the Dodgers in May, making one appearance with the team in July. A free agent after that year, he signed a minor league contract with the Athletics for 2016. Called up four times in 2016, he made nine starts for Oakland but posted an 0–5 record. In the latter part of the season, he pitched for Hanwha in the KBO League, initially as a starting pitcher, though he was moved to the bullpen after posting an 0–3 record in a little over a month. Following his professional career, he earned a Bachelor of Science in Business from NC State and became a Cincinnati-area realtor for Comey & Shepherd." ;

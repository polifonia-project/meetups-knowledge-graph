        mtp:hasAbstract        "La Toya Yvonne Jackson (born May 29, 1956) is an American singer and television personality. The fifth and middle daughter of the Jackson family, Jackson first gained recognition on the family's variety television series, The Jacksons, on CBS between 1976 and 1977. Thereafter, she saw success as a solo recording artist under multiple record labels in the 1980s and 1990s, including Polydor, Sony Music and RCA, where she released nine studio albums over the course of 15 years. Her most successful releases in the United States were her self-titled debut album (1980) and the 1984 single \"Heart Don't Lie\". Jackson's other songs include \"If You Feel the Funk\", \"Bet'cha Gonna Need My Lovin'\", \"Hot Potato\", \"You're Gonna Get Rocked!\", and \"Sexbox\". Another one of Jackson's songs, \"Just Say No\" from her fifth album was composed for US first lady Nancy Reagan and Reagan administrationâ€™s anti-drug campaign. She is a two time New York Times best selling author. Jackson posed for Playboy magazine in 1989 and again in 1991 to promote her New York Times Best Seller La Toya: Growing Up in the Jackson Family. In 1992, Jackson signed a contract with the Moulin Rouge to star in the successful Paris revue, Formidable. Despite subsequent musical success, Jackson's recording career began its decline in the 1990s as a result of her controversial marriage to entertainment manager Jack Gordon, whom she divorced in 1997. After a period of public seclusion, she returned to the music industry in 2004 with the singles \"Just Wanna Dance\", \"Home\", and \"Free the World\", which saw success on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States. In 2011, she was a contestant on the fourth installment of The Celebrity Apprentice and released an extended play, Starting Over, which is her most recent release to date, called, as well, as her best-selling autobiography. From 2013 to 2014, Jackson appeared in her own reality television series on the Oprah Winfrey Network, Life with La Toya, which aired for two seasons." ;

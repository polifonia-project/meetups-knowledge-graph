        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chempakaraman Pillai, alias Venkidi, (15 September 1891 â€“ 26 May 1934) was an Indian-born political activist and revolutionary. Born in Thiruvananthapuram, to Tamil Pillai parents, he left for Europe as a youth, where he spent the rest of his active life as an Indian nationalist and revolutionary. Although his life was mired in controversies, including a squabble with Adolf Hitler, information on his life in Europe was sketchy in the immediate years after his death. More information has come out in recent years. Chempakaraman Pillai is credited with the coining of the salutation and slogan \"Jai Hind\" in the pre-independence days of India. The slogan is still widely used in India." ;

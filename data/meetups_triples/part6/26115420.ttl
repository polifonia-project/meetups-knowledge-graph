She recorded with Thomas Alva Edison, who used her voice extensively in \"tone tests\" of whether a live audience could tell the difference between the actual singer and a recording. In addition to recordings for Edison Records on both phonograph cylinder and Diamond Disc, Case recorded for Victor and Columbia Records, and made sound film for Vitaphone.She was born in Clinton, New Jersey, on October 29, 1887. and was educated by vocal trainer Augusta Öhrström-Renard in New York. She made her debut in 1909 at the New Theatre in New York as the Dutch Boy in Werther, and from 1909 to 1916 she was a member of the Metropolitan Opera Company. In first American performances she created the roles of Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier (1913) and Feodor in Boris Godunov (1913), and singing also Olympia in Tales of Hoffmann, Mimi in La Boheme and Micaela in Carmen. She wrote music and lyrics to several songs during the 1910s and 1920.

She also appeared in documentaries about sound recording. In 1930 she recorded \"Just Awearyin' for You\" by Frank Lebby Stanton and Carrie Jacobs-Bond.

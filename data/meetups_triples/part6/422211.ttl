        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frank Edwin \"Tug\" McGraw Jr. (August 30, 1944 â€“ January 5, 2004) was an American professional baseball relief pitcher and long-time Major League Baseball (MLB) player, often remembered for coining the phrase \"Ya Gotta Believe\", which became the rallying cry for the 1973 New York Mets. McGraw recorded the final out of the 1980 World Series against the Kansas City Royals, striking out Willie Wilson to bring the Philadelphia Phillies their first World Series championship, ending the Phillies' 77-year drought. McGraw's strikeout of Wilson is one of the most famed plays in Philadelphia Phillies history. He was the last active big league player to have played under manager Casey Stengel." ;

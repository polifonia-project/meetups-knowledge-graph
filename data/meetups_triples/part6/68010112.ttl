He was a painter in Crete and Venice. His brother Emmanuel Tzanes was the parish priest of the church of San Giorgio dei Greci. Emmanuel Tzanes was also a famous painter and author. Konstantinos followed the Venetian style and in some instances completely broke from the maniera greca. His other brother Marinos Tzanes was a famous poet. Konstantinos's work influenced both Greek and Italian Painters. His most popular work is the painting by Mary Magdalene which is at the Greek Institute in Venice." ;

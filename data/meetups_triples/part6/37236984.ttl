        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rebbeca Marie Gomez (born March 2, 1997), known professionally as Becky G, is an American singer and actress. She first gained recognition in 2011 when she began posting videos of herself covering popular songs online. One of her videos caught the attention of producer Dr. Luke, who subsequently offered her a joint record deal with Kemosabe Records and RCA Records. While working on her debut effort, Gomez collaborated with artists will.i.am, Cody Simpson and Cher Lloyd. Her official debut single, \"Becky from the Block\", released in 2013, received a positive reception upon its release. She released her debut extended play, Play It Again later that same year. Her second and first 2014 single, \"Can't Get Enough\", featured guest vocals from Pitbull and went on to top the Latin Rhythm Airplay chart in the United States. Gomez achieved mainstream success with the release of \"Shower\", that same year, which went on to enter the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The single would go on to receive a multi platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting two million units sold in the country. Following the success of \"Shower\", Gomez released \"Can't Stop Dancin'\", \"Lovin' So Hard\" and \"Break a Sweat\" during 2014 and 2015, as singles from her then-forthcoming album. She embarked on a co-headlining tour with J Balvin during September and October 2015, spanning throughout the United States. She portrayed Valentina Galindo in two episodes of the musical television series Empire, contributing two new songs to the show's soundtrack. She released her first full-Spanish song \"Sola\" in June 2016. In July 2017, she released her single \"Mayores\", with rapper Bad Bunny, which topped the charts in Spain, Ecuador, Chile and El Salvador, while reaching number three on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. She served as the opening act for girl group Fifth Harmony, for the Latin American leg of their PSA Tour, with shows in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, that same year. In April 2018, she released another hit single \"Sin Pijama\" with Dominican singer Natti Natasha, which also entered the top five of the Hot Latin Songs, peaked at number one in Spain and the top 10 in several countries. In July 2018, Gomez released \"Zooted\", featuring French Montana and Farruko, as her first English-language song in three years. On September 27, 2019, she was featured on the \"Chicken Noodle Soup\" remix by South Korean rapper and dancer J-Hope of BTS. Gomez released her debut studio album Mala Santa in October 2019. She achieved her highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 with the top 20 song \"Mamiii\", a collaboration with Karol G. Gomez released her second studio album Esquemas in May 2022. Her success has led her to collaborate with artists such as Daddy Yankee, Christina Aguilera, and David Guetta. Her accolades include two American Music Awards, four ASCAP Latin Awards, four Latin American Music Awards, plus the honorable Extraordinary Evolution Award, six Premios Juventud, and four nominations from the Latin Grammy Awards." ;

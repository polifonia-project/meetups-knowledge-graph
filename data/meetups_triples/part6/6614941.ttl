        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rabbi Dovid Feinstein (Hebrew: דוד פיינשטיין; 1929 – November 6, 2020) was a Torah scholar and halachic authority, considered by many as the leading halachic authority in the United States in the 21st century. He served as the rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem yeshiva elementary and high school and kollel, inheriting the position after the passing of his father Rabbi Moshe Feinstein in 1986. He was also a prolific and erudite author, penning at least 9 books on such topics as halacha, Torah and the Jewish calendar, as well as some very popular Passover Haggadahs. His brother, Rabbi Reuven Feinstein, is rosh yeshiva of the Staten Island branch of Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem." ;

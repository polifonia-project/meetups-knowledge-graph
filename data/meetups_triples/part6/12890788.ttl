        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sir Thomas Sewell PC (c. 1710 – 6 March 1784) was an English judge and Member of Parliament, and Master of the Rolls from 1764 to 1784. He was the son of Thomas Sewell of West Ham, Essex. He is said to have been \"bred up under an attorney\". Sewell was a member of Middle Temple, called to the bar in 1734, and practised in the Chancery courts, where he was highly successful. He became a bencher of his inn and King's Counsel in 1754, and Treasurer of the Inn in 1765. By 1764, he was thought to be making between £3000 and £4000 a year from his practice, and was popular among religious dissenters as their champion in the courts." ;

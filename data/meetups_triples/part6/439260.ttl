        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kevin Scott Nash (born July 9, 1959) is an American actor and retired professional wrestler, currently signed to WWE under a legends contract. He is best known for his tenure with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) where he performed under his real name, Kevin Nash. He also performed under his real name in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). From mid-1993 through early 1996, Nash performed for the WWF under an alpha male, biker thug gimmick named Diesel (also known as \"Big Daddy Cool\"). During this time, he won the WWF World, Intercontinental and Tag Team Championships (the WWF Triple Crown) and at that year's Slammy Awards won the MVP (now Superstar of the Year) and Best Tag Team (now Tag Team of the Year) with Shawn Michaels. Between WWF, WCW, and TNA, Nash has won a total of 20 championships, including being a six-time world champion (five-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion and one-time WWF Champion) and a 12-time world tag team champion between the three promotions. Nash's 358-day WWF Championship reign is the longest of the 1990s. During his time in WCW, Nash became the first wrestler to defeat Goldberg and in the process ended his undefeated streak of 173â€“0 at Starrcade in 1998. Nash was a member of The Kliq, an influential backstage group that included Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Scott Hall, and X-Pac. At a most noteworthy period of his career, Nash reached the peak of his wrestling career success while in WCW when he became one of the three founding members of the New World Order (nWo), along with Hulk Hogan and Scott Hall. Nash was inducted individually into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015 and in 2020 as a member of the New World Order alongside Hogan, Hall, and X-Pac." ;

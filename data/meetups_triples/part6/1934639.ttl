In addition to singing, Jey also plays bass guitar, electric guitar, drums and keyboards. Jey lived in Brooklyn, New York from 1980 to 1985. It was during this time he became interested in becoming a musician due to all the influences throughout the city. He is fluent in both English and Italian." ;

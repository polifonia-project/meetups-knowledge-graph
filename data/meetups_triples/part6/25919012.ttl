She is the cousin of both Egyptian actress Feyrouz and entertainer Nelly. She was born in Cairo to an Egyptian family of Armenian Christian background. She started as a child actress imitating other actresses, including appearances on the Egyptian National Theater promoted by Muallem Sadiq. She was given her first movie role through Egyptian film director and producer Anwar Wagdi and screenwriter / playwright Abo El Seoud El Ebiary in Habeebti Sousou. El Ebiary also chose the name Lebleba after seeing the multi-talented child actress, comedian, dancer and singer Ninochka Kupelian. In the 1970s, she acted alongside Egyptian leading man Salah Zulfikar in Borj El-Athraa and Fi Saif Lazim Nohib. She married actor Hassan Youssef, but they divorced. She never remarried." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jean-Claude Brisseau (French: [bʁiso]; 17 July 1944 – 11 May 2019) was a French filmmaker best known for his 2002 film Secret Things (\"Choses Secrètes\") and his 2006 film The Exterminating Angels (\"Les Anges exterminateurs\"). His film Céline was nominated for the Golden Bear Award at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival. At the Cannes Film Festival, he was awarded the France Culture Award in 2003 for Secret Things; in 1988 he was awarded the Special Award for the Youth. In 2002, Brisseau was arrested on charges of sexual harassment after three women came forward accusing him of cajoling them into performing sexual acts on camera by promising them a film role. He was eventually found guilty, fined and given a suspended one-year prison sentence. Brisseau made a semi-autobiographical film in 2006 about this incident, Les Anges Exterminateurs. He was formerly a professor at La Fémis in Paris. Brisseau died in Paris on 11 May 2019 at the age of 74." ;

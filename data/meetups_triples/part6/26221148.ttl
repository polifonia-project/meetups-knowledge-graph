        mtp:hasAbstract        "Poltpalingada Booboorowie (born c. 1830 – died 4 July 1901) was a prominent Aboriginal man of the clan of the Ngarrindjeri nation, who lived among the community of fringe dwellers in Adelaide, South Australia during the 1890s. He was a well-known and popular figure among Adelaide residents, who knew him as Tommy Walker, and his antics and court appearances were reported upon regularly in the newspapers. After his death, his remains became the subject of a scandal when it was discovered that the city coroner, William Ramsay Smith, had removed his remains before burial and sent his body to the University of Edinburgh as an anthropological specimen." ;

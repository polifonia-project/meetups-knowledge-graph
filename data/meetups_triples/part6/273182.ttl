        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bryan David \"Butch\" Vig (born August 2, 1955) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the drummer and co-producer of the alternative rock band Garbage and the producer of the diamond-selling Nirvana album Nevermind. His work on the latter earned him the nickname the Nevermind Man. A native of Wisconsin, Vig was based in Madison for much of his career, from studying at the University of Wisconsin to performing in local bands Spooner and Fire Town. He eventually set up his own recording studio in Madison, Smart Studios, with bandmate Steve Marker. After becoming well-known as a producer, he formed and played drums with Garbage, who sold 17 million records over a ten-year period. Vig returned to producing full-time when Garbage went on hiatus in 2005. The band reconvened in 2010 to record material for their fifth album. In 2012, NME named Vig the 9th greatest producer." ;

After a follow-up single, \"But I Do\" b/w \"Smokey Joe\", flopped, they were dropped from Dimension Records. The Jewels went on tour with James Brown in 1964, with a demanding nightly schedule. They visited the studios of Motown Records on the Detroit leg of the tour, hoping to record, but the building was closed that day. They did record two singles while they toured with Brown, but after a year and a half with Brown the group split up. Not ready to leave the tour, Harvin asked Brown if she could stay. Brown agreed, but he required her name change from Harvin to the stage name High. She continued singing with Brown for the next 30-plus years.

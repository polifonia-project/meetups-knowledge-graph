        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marion Nestle (born 1936) is an American molecular biologist, nutritionist, and public health advocate. She is the Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health Emerita at New York University. Her research examines scientific and socioeconomic influences on food choice, obesity, and food safety, emphasizing the role of food marketing. Through her work at NYU and her award-winning books, Nestle has had a national influence on food policy, nutrition, and food education. Nestle became a Fellow of the American Society for Nutritional Sciences in 2005. In 2019 she received the Food Policy Changemaker Award, as a \"leader who is working to transform the food system\". Nestle's name is pronounced like the English verb \"nestle\", not like the name of the Swiss food conglomerate, to which she is unrelated. In 2022, the University of California Press published Slow Cooked: An Unexpected Life in Food Politics, a memoir." ;

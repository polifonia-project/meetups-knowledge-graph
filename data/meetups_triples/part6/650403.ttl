        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark LoMonaco (born July 14, 1971) is an American professional wrestler, currently signed to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and Impact Wrestling under the ring name Bully Ray. He was previously known as one-half of The Dudley Boyz tag team under the ring name Bubba Ray Dudley during his tenures in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Debuting in 1991, LoMonaco came to prominence when he joined ECW as a member of The Dudley Brothers in 1995. He formed a tag team with D-Von Dudley called The Dudley Boyz, who became eight-time ECW World Tag Team Champions. In 1999, they moved to the WWF (now WWE) and became eight-time World Tag Team Champions, as well as one-time WWE Tag Team Champions and WCW World Tag Team Champions. They are considered one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era. Dudley also held the WWE Hardcore Championship 10 times before both men left in 2005. They joined TNA later that year, becoming one-time NWA World Tag Team Champions and two-time TNA World Tag Team Champions. After the team disbanded in 2010, LoMonaco competed as a singles wrestler under the name Bully Ray and went on to hold the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice. He left TNA in 2015, and The Dudley Boyz returned to WWE for two years before joining Ring of Honor (ROH) until 2020. The Dudley Boyz are recognized as one of the most prolific tag teams in professional wrestling history, with 23 world tag team championships between ECW, WWE, Impact, and NJPW. They were inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2014 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018. LoMonaco himself has won 36 titles between ECW, WWE, Impact, NJPW and ROH, factoring in the aforementioned tag team championships, 10 WWE Hardcore Championships, two TNA World Championships, and one ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship (held with The Briscoe Brothers)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas J. Barry (July 27, 1907 â€“ March, 1987) was a trainer of Thoroughbred racehorse who won two American Classic Races with foreign-bred horses. Born in Ireland, as a young man he emigrated to the United States where he became a citizen around 1930. In 1951 Tom Barry won the training title at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey which marked the beginning of a decade in which he enjoyed considerable racing success. In 1952, Barry began the race conditioning of a colt named for owner Joseph Gavegnano. Under regular jockey Sam Boulmetis, Sr., in 1953 the two-year-old Errard King won the Tyro Stakes and the Laurel Futurity Stakes and the following year captured two very important races, the American Derby and Arlington Classic." ;

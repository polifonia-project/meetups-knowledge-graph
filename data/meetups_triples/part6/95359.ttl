While finding success in foreign affairs, his reign saw several wars with Iran, Poland and Sweden, as well as internal instabilities such as the Salt Riot in Moscow and the Cossack revolt of Stenka Razin in southern Russia. In religious matters, he sided closely with Patriarch Nikon during the schism in the Russian Orthodox Church which saw unpopular liturgical reforms. He was the first tsar to sign laws on his own authority and his council passed the Sobornoye Ulozheniye of 1649 which strengthened the bonds between autocracy and the lower nobility, at the time of his death Russia spanned almost two billion acres (8.1 million km2)." ;

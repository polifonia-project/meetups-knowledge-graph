        mtp:hasAbstract        "David George Dirk Maggs (born St. Helier, Jersey, February 1955) is a British freelance writer and director. During his career as a Senior Producer in BBC Radio he made radio drama adopting a cinematic-sounding approach, combining filmic story construction, layered sound effects, orchestral music and digital recording technology. Maggs introduced productions in Dolby Surround in BBC Radio and termed the result, \"Audio Movies\". Maggs studied Drama for a BEd degree from 1974 to 1978 at King Alfred's College, Winchester. The college gained university status in 2005, when he was invited to become one of the first Honorary Fellows of the University of Winchester for his work in the Dramatic Arts. In 2019 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate for his work in the Arts by Bournemouth University. In December 2021 Maggs was on a team representing the University of Winchester in BBC TV's Christmas University Challenge. Maggs was awarded \"Best Audiobook Producer\" Award by the Audio Publishers Association at the 2021 Audio Production Awards at the BFI in London. Maggs is married to Lesley Maggs, n√©e Snow, whom he met in 1978 when they were Studio Managers in BBC World Service. They have three grown-up sons." ;

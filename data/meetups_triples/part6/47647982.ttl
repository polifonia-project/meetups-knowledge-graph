Engravings of his photographs were widely used on British and British Commonwealth postage stamps, currency, and other official documents in the 1930s. His theatrical portraits were the source for two paintings by Walter Sickert. With his wife Yvonne Gregory, they produced a number of photographic books of the female nude. He was an expert in the cultivation of the rose and the editor of The Rose Annual." ;

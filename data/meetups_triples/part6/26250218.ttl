He released his eponymous album in March 2012 from which three singles, \"Let's Don't Call It a Night\", \"Crying on a Suitcase\", and \"The Good Life\" were released. In October 2014, James released \"Fall Apart\" as the first single from a planned second studio album, but Sony opted not to release the record and they split ways. In 2017, James released his second album, Strip It Down, to critical acclaim." ;

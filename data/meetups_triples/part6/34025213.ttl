        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ada Goodrich Freer (born 15 May 1857 in Uppingham, Rutland, England, died in New York, 24 February 1931), was a medium, clairvoyant, psychical researcher and author. Much of her work was published under the pseudonym Miss X. Freer was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research and, under strong suspicion of fraud, she was disowned from the Society. She was later caught cheating at a s√©ance and subsequently emigrated to Jerusalem and, later, the United States." ;

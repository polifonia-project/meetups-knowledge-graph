        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Mulhern (born 12 June 1988), now known as Lee Matthews, is a popular Irish singer-songwriter. Starting age 8, Lee Mulhern (his birth name) had performed as a child star prodigy covering pop and country songs on many Irish and UK radio and television shows. At age 17, he embarked on a series of music projects like Streetwize, Streetside and Access All Areas, in a bid to be launched as an \"international boy band\" made up of singers from various nationalities. After the boy band projects fell through, he relaunched a solo music career adopting the name Lee.M, and for a short time formed NXT-GEN, an electropop duo collaboration with Pete Doherty. In 2013, as Lee Matthews, he became part of the country music scene in Ireland in the Country and Irish genre releasing two albums, A Little Bitty Country in 2014 and It's a Great Day to Be Alive in 2015 and a string of singles releases." ;

Her music style could be described as pop. Most of her music is in Spanish, although a few tracks on some albums were recorded in English. Although her albums are not readily available in the U.S. record shelves as they are in Spain and Latin America, they can be found on the Internet. She has sold more than 1,000,000 records since 2002." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ettore Ewen (born March 1, 1986) is an American professional wrestler and former powerlifter. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Big E, but is currently inactive due to an injury. In addition to his singles career in professional wrestling, he is a decorated tag team wrestler as part of The New Day with Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods. Ewen was a collegiate football player at the University of Iowa and later became a powerlifter and a USA Powerlifting champion. He also won a state championship in high-school wrestling. Upon signing with WWE in 2009, Ewen was assigned to its developmental brand Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the ring name Big E Langston. After FCW was rebranded to NXT, he became the second NXT Champion. He was promoted to WWE's main roster in December 2012, and his ring name was shortened to Big E in February 2014. Since his main roster debut, he has become a one-time WWE Champion, two-time Intercontinental Champion, two-time Raw Tag Team Champion, and six-time SmackDown Tag Team Champion. As a part of The New Day, he holds the tandem record for the longest Raw Tag Team Championship reign at 483 days. In 2020, Ewen resumed his singles career and was eventually separated from his New Day teammates in the 2020 WWE Draft. He won the men's Money in the Bank ladder match in 2021, before successfully cashing it in later that year to win the WWE Championship, becoming the 33rd Triple Crown Champion in the company's history." ;

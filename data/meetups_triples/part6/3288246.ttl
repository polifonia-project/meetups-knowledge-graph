        mtp:hasAbstract        "Shinichiro Ohta (太田 真一郎, Ōta Shin'ichirō, born March 20, 1971) is a Japanese voice actor and television announcer noted primarily in the English-speaking world for his appearance as the kitchen reporter in Iron Chef, where he was known for his rapid-fire announcing style. On the English-language version of Iron Chef, which aired on Food Network, Ohta's dialogue is dubbed by American voice actor Jeff Manning. Ohta's character is perhaps best known for his line, \"Fukui-san?\" (Mr. Fukui), which he would say several times per episode, when interrupting Kenji Fukui's commentary with a report from the field. His talent agency is Aoni Production." ;

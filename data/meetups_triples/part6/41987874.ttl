He originally started his career in the Kaientai Dojo (K-Dojo) promotion in July 2002, but later left the promotion to become a freelancer, before signing with Union Pro Wrestling (Union Pro) in 2005. Through Union Pro's working relationship, Kodaka also began working for Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), where he adopted his current, hardcore wrestling-based style. Kodaka remained affiliated with Union Pro until the promotion folded in October 2015, after which he became a founding member of Pro-Wrestling Basara (Basara). Kodaka is currently in his fourth reign as the Union Max Champion, and his second reign as BJW Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion, while also being a former one-time KO-D Openweight Champion and three-time DDT Extreme Champion.

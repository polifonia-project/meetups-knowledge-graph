        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frederick William Cook (16 November 1947 â€“ 1 February 2022) was an Australian rules footballer. He played 33 games with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL) from 1967 until 1969 but it was in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) with Yarraville and Port Melbourne that he made his name. In his brief career with Footscray he played in defence and only kicked two goals; at Yarraville, he won the J. J. Liston Trophy playing as a ruckman and defender; then with Port Melbourne, he became one of the Association's premier forwards, leading the VFA goalkicking in five separate seasons and kicking an all-time VFA career record of 1336 goals from his 300 games." ;

Born in Stakeford, Ingham began his career with Football League Second Division side Burnley, making his senior debut in 1972. After eight years in the Burnley first team, he transferred to Bradford City in 1980 for a fee of £30,000 and went on to play almost 80 league games before being forced to retire in 1982. He later played non-league football for Accrington Stanley while working as a bus driver." ;

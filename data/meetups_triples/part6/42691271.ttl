        mtp:hasAbstract        "Philip Wadsworth (March 7, 1832 â€“ September 12, 1901) was an American dry goods merchant, politician, and military leader. Born to the prominent Wadsworth family in New Hartford, Connecticut, he attended private academies until he was sixteen, when he entered the dry goods trade. In 1853, he moved to Chicago, Illinois to join his brother in his dry goods operation, eventually rising to become president of Philip Wadsworth & Co., a clothing store. Wadsworth was also interested in the military, and although he never officially served, he maintained a military company where soldiers could train in advance of the Civil War. Later in his life he returned to Connecticut where he served a two-year term in the Connecticut House of Representatives." ;

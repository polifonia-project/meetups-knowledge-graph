His channel initially released video game-related content until the popularity of his educational series DOT saw discussions of general interest become the focus of Vsauce, encompassing explanations of science, philosophy, culture, and illusion. As the host of Vsauce, Stevens has become one of the most successful YouTubers (with over 18 million subscribers and over 2.4 billion views), as well as a leading figure in the internet-driven popularization of science and education. In 2017, he created and starred in the YouTube Premium series Mind Field, and presented the nationwide educational stage tour Brain Candy Live! alongside Adam Savage." ;

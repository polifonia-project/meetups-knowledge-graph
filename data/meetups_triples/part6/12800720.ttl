        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brooke Wyckoff (born March 30, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player and current Head Coach at Florida State University. Florida State announced this on March 29, 2022 after the departure of Coach Sue Semrau A 6'1\" forward from Florida State, Wyckoff played in the WNBA from 2001 to 2009, competing for the Orlando Miracle, the Connecticut Sun, and the Chicago Sky. Brooke played 132 games for the Sun, where she's remembered for the clutch three-pointer she hit in the final seconds of Game 2 of the 2005 WNBA Finals against the Sacramento Monarchs at Mohegan Sun Arena. That shot sent the game to overtime. She played for Estudiantes in Spain during the 2008–09 WNBA off-season. She tore her ACL and decided to retire following the 2009 season. She's been an assistant coach on the Florida State women’s basketball staff since June 2011. Prior to that, she spent two years as an assistant girls’ basketball coach at Lakota East High in Cincinnati." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Lewis Graham (October 31, 1935 – July 6, 2020) was an American mathematician credited by the American Mathematical Society as \"one of the principal architects of the rapid development worldwide of discrete mathematics in recent years\". He was president of both the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America, and his honors included the Leroy P. Steele Prize for lifetime achievement and election to the National Academy of Sciences. After graduate study at the University of California, Berkeley, Graham worked for many years at Bell Labs and later at the University of California, San Diego. He did important work in scheduling theory, computational geometry, Ramsey theory, and quasi-randomness, and many topics in mathematics are named after him. He published six books and about 400 papers, and had nearly 200 co-authors, including many collaborative works with his wife Fan Chung and with Paul Erdős. Graham has been featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! for being not only \"one of the world's foremost mathematicians\", but also an accomplished trampolinist and juggler. He served as president of the International Jugglers' Association." ;

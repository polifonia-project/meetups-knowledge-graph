        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nikola Ivanov (Bulgarian: Никола Иванов) (2 March 1861, Kalofer – 10 September 1940, Sofia) was a Bulgarian general and a minister of defence of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. One of the first graduate of the General Staff Military Academy of St Petersburg, he fought as a volunteer during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). Ivanov then became chief of the Headquarters of the Bulgarian Army between 10 May 1894 and 29 November 1896 then minister of war between 29 November 1896 and 30 January 1899. During the First Balkan War, Ivanov lead the Bulgarian Second Army throughout the successful Siege of Adrianople. On 4 July his army was defeated at the Battle of Kilkis–Lachanas during the Second Balkan War, a month later his troops succeeded in halting the oncoming Greek army at the Battle of Kresna Gorge as the catastrophic Second Balkan War came to an end." ;

Originally playing for Nightcliff Football Club in the Northern Territory Football League (NTFL), then the Cairns City Cobras in the 2001â€“2002 seasons, Roe was selected in the 2002 rookie draft by the Collingwood Football Club and placed on its rookie list. He was delisted at the end of 2003 having not played an AFL game, and moved to South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club North Adelaide. He was given a second chance at AFL level and was placed on the Brisbane Lions rookie list in the 2006 rookie draft. Roe was delisted by Brisbane following the 2009 season, after playing 50 AFL games." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Leonhardt (born January 1, 1973) is an American journalist and columnist. Since April 30, 2020, he has written the daily \"The Morning\" newsletter for The New York Times. He also contributes to the paper's Sunday Review section. His column previously appeared weekly in The New York Times. He previously wrote the paper's daily e-mail newsletter, which bore his own name. As of October 2018, he also co-hosted \"The Argument\", a weekly opinion podcast with Ross Douthat and Michelle Goldberg. Leonhardt was previously the head of an internal strategy group, known as the 2020 group, that made recommendations to Times executives in January 2017 about changing the newsroom and the news report in response to the rise of digital media. Prior to that, he was the managing editor of The Upshot, a then-new Times venture focusing on politics, policy, and economics, with an emphasis on data and graphics. Before The Upshot, he was the paper's Washington bureau chief and an economics columnist. He joined the Times in 1999 and wrote the \"Economics Scene\" column, and for the Times Sunday Magazine. He is the author of a short e-book published by the Times in February 2013: Here's the Deal: How Washington Can Solve the Deficit and Spur Growth. Before coming to the Times, he wrote for Business Week and The Washington Post. In April 2011 he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary \"for his graceful penetration of America's complicated economic questions, from the federal budget deficit to health care reform\"." ;

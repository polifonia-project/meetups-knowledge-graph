        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sidney James (born Solomon Joel Cohen; 8 May 1913 â€“ 26 April 1976) was a British actor and comedian, born to a middle-class Jewish family in South Africa, whose career encompassed radio, television, stage and screen. He was best known for numerous roles in the Carry On film series. James, having started his career in his native country, found his greatest success in the UK. Beginning his screen career playing bit parts in films from 1947, he was cast in numerous small and supporting roles into the 1950s. He appeared in the film The Lavender Hill Mob in 1951, starring Alec Guinness. His profile was raised as Tony Hancock's co-star in Hancock's Half Hour, first in the radio series and later when it was adapted for television and ran from 1954 to 1960. Afterwards, he became known as a regular performer in the Carry On films, appearing in 19 films of the series, with the top billing roles in 17 (in the other two he was cast below Frankie Howerd). His starring roles in television sitcoms continued. He starred in the 1970s sitcom Bless This House until his death in 1976." ;

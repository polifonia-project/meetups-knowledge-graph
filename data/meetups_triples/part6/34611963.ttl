Tepper studied under illustrator Harvey Dunn at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City.

Additionally, his illustrations appeared in advertising for major companies such as General Electric, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Mobil, and Texaco. In the 1950s, Tepper created television commercials while an art director for J. Walter Thompson. Later in life, he became a songwriter whose work was recorded by Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Glenn Miller, and Harry James.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Martin Lee (born 1 February 1966) is an English former professional footballer and sports co-commentator. As a player, he was a midfielder who notably played in the Premier League for Newcastle United and West Ham United. His time at St James Park saw him win the Football League First Division in 1993. He also played in the Football League for Charlton Athletic, Derby County, Oldham Athletic and Wycombe Wanderers. He was capped 21 times by England, scoring twice and was a member of the World Cup 98 squad. Following retirement, he harboured interests of becoming a manager and in 2006 he was interviewed for the vacant AFC Bournemouth job, but ultimately has worked away from the sport with a stint as co-commentator for TEN Sports. He was inducted into the Newcastle United Hall of Fame in 2019." ;

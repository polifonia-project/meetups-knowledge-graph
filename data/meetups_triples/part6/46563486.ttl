        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Levin (Hebrew: דוד לוין, Russian: Давид Левин; born September 16, 1999) is an Israeli-born professional ice hockey player. He currently plays for Nottingham Panthers in the EIHL. He previously played for the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and for Dinamo Riga of the Kontinental Hockey League. Born in Israel, Levin initially only played inline hockey due to the scarcity of ice rinks in Israel. At the age of 12 he moved to Canada in order to pursue a hockey career, living with relatives in the Greater Toronto Area, and it was in Canada that Levin first played organized ice hockey. He was drafted first overall in the 2015 OHL Priority Selection, and began playing for the Wolves in the 2015–16 season." ;

She joined the Feminist Studies department at UC Santa Cruz in Fall 2020. Ulysse is most known for her 2015 book Why Haiti Needs New Narratives: A Post-Quake Chronicle. She is a feminist artist-anthropologist-activist, and self-described Post-Zora Interventionist. An interdisciplinary methodologist, her research interests culminate at the intersections of geopolitics, historical representations and the dailiness of Black diasporic conditions." ;

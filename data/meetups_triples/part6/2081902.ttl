        mtp:hasAbstract        "August Edmun \"Augie\" Garrido Jr. (February 6, 1939 – March 15, 2018) was an American professional baseball player and coach in NCAA Division I college baseball, best known for his stints with the Cal State Fullerton Titans and Texas Longhorns. Garrido compiled a collegiate record of 1,975–951–9 and retired in 2016 as the coach with, at the time, the most wins in college baseball history. His win total was surpassed by Mike Martin of the Florida State Seminoles in 2018. He took his programs to 15 College World Series, winning five of them: three with Cal State Fullerton and two with Texas. He is often considered to be arguably the greatest coach in college baseball history." ;

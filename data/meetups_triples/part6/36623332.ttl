        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lucy Honour Ruby Spraggan (born 21 July 1991) is an English singer-songwriter. She auditioned for The X Factor in 2012, performing her own composition, \"Last Night\". On 3 November 2012, it was announced she would be quitting her run on The X Factor due to illness, so she subsequently finished in ninth place, and second in her category. Following the show Spraggan was signed a recording contract with Columbia Records. Spraggan was the first contestant in the show's history to score a Top 40 single and album before the live shows aired, with her independently released album Top Room at the Zoo. Her debut major label album, Join the Club, was released on 7 October 2013, reaching number seven in the UK Albums Chart. She has since released four more studio albums; the latest, Choices, was released on 26 February 2021 and debuted at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was preceded by the singles \"Flowers\", \"Roots\" and \"Sober\"." ;

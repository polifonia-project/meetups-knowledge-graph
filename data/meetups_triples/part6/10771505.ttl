        mtp:hasAbstract        "Neil William Barrett (born 24 December 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a central midfielder. He played in the Football League for Portsmouth and in the Scottish Premier League for Dundee and Livingston. Barrett started his career in the youth system of Chelsea, before joining Portsmouth in 2001. He made over 20 appearances in his first season with Portsmouth, but having not played over a season-and-a-half he moved to Dundee on loan. He joined them permanently in 2004, but left a year later following their relegation from the Scottish Premier League. Following a period with Livingston, he signed for Conference National club Woking in 2007. After half a season with them he joined Ebbsfleet United, and played for them in their victory in the 2008 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. Barrett left Ebbsfleet after two seasons to sign for York City in 2009 and played for them in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. He was released by York in 2011 and after a short spell with Havant & Waterlooville in the Conference South he returned to Ebbsfleet United. After their relegation to the Conference South in 2013 he signed for their divisional rivals Basingstoke Town, but was released by them after one season. He finished his career with spells in the Isthmian League Premier Division with Leatherhead and Metropolitan Police." ;

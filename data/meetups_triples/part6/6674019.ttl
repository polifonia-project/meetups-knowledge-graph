        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Anthony Magnante (/məɡˈnænti/; Italian pronunciation: [maɲˈɲante]; born June 17, 1965) is a former professional baseball pitcher. He played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball as a left-handed relief pitcher for four teams. On August 22, 1997, Magnante pitched an immaculate inning by striking out three batters on nine pitches in the ninth inning of a 6–3 win over the Cincinnati Reds. Magnante became the 20th National League pitcher and the 29th pitcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. In 2002, the Oakland Athletics released Magnante days before vesting his pension because of the acquisition of Ricardo Rincón. This moment is depicted in the film Moneyball. As of 2012, he is a math teacher at Agoura High School." ;

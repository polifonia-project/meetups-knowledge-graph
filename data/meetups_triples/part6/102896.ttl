        mtp:hasAbstract        "Neil Mullane Finn OBE (born 27 May 1958) is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and musician who is known for being a member of Crowded House, Split Enz (which he co-fronted with brother Tim), and Fleetwood Mac. Finn rose to prominence in the late 1970s with Split Enz and wrote many of the band's most successful songs, including \"One Step Ahead\", \"History Never Repeats\", \"I Got You\", and \"Message to My Girl\". After Split Enz broke up in 1984, Finn founded Crowded House with Split Enz's final drummer Paul Hester in 1985 and served as the band's lead singer. The group achieved international success in 1987 when they released the single \"Don't Dream It's Over\", written by Finn. After Crowded House disbanded in 1996, Finn and his brother released two albums as the Finn Brothers, before reforming Crowded House in 2006. In April 2018, Finn joined Fleetwood Mac for their forthcoming tour that year. Finn has also recorded several successful solo albums and assembled diverse musicians for the 7 Worlds Collide project. Ed O'Brien of Radiohead has hailed Finn as popular music's \"most prolific writer of great songs\"." ;

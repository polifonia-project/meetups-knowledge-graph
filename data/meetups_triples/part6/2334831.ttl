        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ryan Joseph Fitzpatrick (born November 24, 1982) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons. During his career, Fitzpatrick started at quarterback for nine different teams, the most in league history. He is also the only NFL player to have a passing and rushing touchdown with eight different teams. Fitzpatrick played college football at Harvard, where he was the school's first quarterback to have over 1,000 rushing yards, and was selected by the St. Louis Rams in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft. His longest stint was with the Buffalo Bills for four seasons, while his only two winning seasons were with the 2015 New York Jets and the 2020 Miami Dolphins. As a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2018, he also became the first NFL quarterback to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games. Due to his competitive, but inconsistent performances, Fitzpatrick received the nicknames \"Fitzmagic\" and \"Fitztragic\". He holds the most career passing yards and passing touchdowns among NFL quarterbacks without a postseason appearance." ;

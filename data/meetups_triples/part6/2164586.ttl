        mtp:hasAbstract        "Derek Francis Johnson (27 January 1950 – 4 January 2020), known professionally as Derek Acorah, was a British spiritual medium. He was best known for his television work on Most Haunted, broadcast on Living TV (2002–2010). His career as a medium was punctuated by allegations of fakery and he also attracted controversy over a number of seances during which he reportedly made contact with high-profile figures. Before his career as a medium, Acorah played as a footballer, and was once on the books of Liverpool, but his career was cut short by injury." ;

He left the band in 1996, but rejoined in 2004 and left again in 2014. In addition to Testament, Christian has also played in HavocHate and Trinity Fallen, and later served as the bassist for Trauma. He is known for his finger playing style and jazz-like bass parts, which can be heard on Testament songs such as \"Souls of Black\" and \"Disciples of the Watch\", although he has also occasionally been seen using a guitar pick. Christian also performed backing vocals in Testament." ;

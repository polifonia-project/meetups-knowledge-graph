        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Young-pyo (Korean: 이영표; Korean pronunciation: [i.jʌŋ.pʰjo]; born 23 April 1977) is a retired South Korean professional footballer who played as a right-footed left back. Lee was recognized for his speed and dribbling skills. His former manager Martin Jol once called him \"the best left back in Holland\". Prior to playing for PSV Eindhoven and Tottenham Hotspur, Lee started his professional career at FC Seoul, then known as Anyang LG Cheetahs in the Korean K League and then spent two years with PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands, earning high acclaim from PSV Coach Guus Hiddink, who had previously coached Lee and South Korea during the 2002 World Cup. Recognized as the best left-back in the Netherlands after the 2004–05 season, Tottenham signed him amidst heavy competition with several Serie A clubs. He transferred to Tottenham in August 2005. On 19 November 2008, Lee became the seventh Korean player to earn 100 caps in a World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia. During the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, Lee captained the national team twice after the substitutions of the regular Korean captain, Park Ji-sung. Post-retirement, he received high accolades from professionals and laymen for his spot-on commentaries and uncanny ability to predict various football related matters. So much so that some took to comparing him to Paul the Octopus. On January 1st, 2021 he began his 2-year stint as the CEO of the first tier k-league football team Gangwon FC." ;

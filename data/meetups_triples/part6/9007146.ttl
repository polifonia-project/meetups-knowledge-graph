        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Andrew White (born May 9, 1946) is a former American football running back. After playing college football at Weber State University, he joined the New York Jets as the 17th pick in the 1968 Common Draft. He was on the Jets' roster for the 1968 AFL Championship victory over the Oakland Raiders, and for the third AFL-NFL World Championship game, in which the AFL's Jets defeated the NFL's champion Baltimore Colts. Lee White played for the Jets for four years, until he was traded to the NFL's Los Angeles Rams. With the Rams he played several games, but found it hard to settle into the area. White was traded along with Deacon Jones and Greg Wojcik from the Rams to the San Diego Chargers for Jeff Staggs, a second rounder in 1972 (30th overall–Jim Bertelsen) and a second and third rounder in 1973 (31st and 60th overall–Cullen Bryant and Tim Stokes respectively) on January 29, 1972. He retired in 1973." ;

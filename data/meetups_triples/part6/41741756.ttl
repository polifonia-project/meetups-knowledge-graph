        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brock Speer (December 28, 1920 â€“ March 29, 1999) sang bass for the Speer Family Southern Gospel musical group and was a leader in Southern Gospel music. One might say that Southern Gospel music was Speer's life. David Liverett's book, This Is My Story: 145 of the World's Greatest Gospel Singers, includes the following comments written by Speer's nephew, Steve Speer, and printed in the program distributed at Brock's funeral: Jackson Brock Speer was born in Winston County, Alabama, just two months before his father and mother began a singing group called the Speer Quartet. For the remaining seventy-eight years of his life, he was inextricably intertwined with that group. With only one exception -- World War II -- he sang with his family his entire life." ;

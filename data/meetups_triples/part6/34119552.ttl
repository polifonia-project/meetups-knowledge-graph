He was primarily interested in Diptera and he described many new species in this Order. He studied exotic insects as well as those of Finland, especially those of Madeira and Cape Verde. Frey acquired by exchange or purchase many collections, notably the Georg Böttcher (1865–1915) collection of Philippine Diptera. When he retired, the University of Finland purchased his collection for the museum." ;

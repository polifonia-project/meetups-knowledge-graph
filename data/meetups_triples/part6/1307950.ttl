        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Shrieve (born July 6, 1949) is an American drummer, percussionist, and composer. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Santana, playing on the band's first seven albums from 1969 to 1974. At age 20, Shrieve was the second youngest musician to perform at Woodstock. His drum solo during \"Soul Sacrifice\" in the Woodstock film has been described as \"electrifying\", although he considers his drum solo during \"Soul Sacrifice\" in 1970 at Tanglewood as being better." ;

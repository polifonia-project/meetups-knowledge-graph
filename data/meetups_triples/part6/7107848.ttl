        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gyan Evans (born c. 1960), who performs as Gyan (/ɡiːˈɑːn/), is an Australian singer-songwriter and record producer. She began her musical career in the Sydney band Haiku before winning the 1986 grand final in the local version of the TV talent quest Star Search. This led to a recording contract with Warner Music, which resulted in her October 1989 debut self-titled album. It peaked in the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and provided \"Wait\", which reached the top 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1990 she won the ARIA Award for Best New Talent." ;

Following her baptism, Olga took the name Elenа (Old East Slavic: Ѡлена, romanized: Olena). She is known for her subjugation of the Drevlians, a tribe that had killed her husband Igor of Kiev. Even though it was her grandson Vladimir who converted the entire nation to Christianity, because of her efforts to spread Christianity through Rus', Olga is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church with the epithet \"Equal to the Apostles\". Her feast day is 11 July." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jonathan Thomas \"John\" Squire (born 24 November 1962) is an English musician, songwriter and painter. He was the guitarist for The Stone Roses, a rock band in which he formed a songwriting partnership with lead singer Ian Brown. After leaving the Stone Roses he went on to found The Seahorses and has since released two solo albums. In 2007, Squire gave up music to fully commit to painting. However, he later returned to music when the Stone Roses reformed in 2011. When the Stone Roses disbanded for a second time in 2017 Squire once again returned to painting. However, he continues to play guitar occasionally, including making guest appearances for two shows with Liam Gallagher at Knebworth in 2022. Squire has been described as one of the most accomplished and influential British rock guitarists of the late 1980s and early 1990s, known for his chiming melodies, spiraling riffs and live solos. He was voted the 13th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years in a national poll by BBC 6 Music in 2010." ;

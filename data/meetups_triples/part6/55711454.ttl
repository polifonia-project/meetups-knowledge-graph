        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexander James O'Connor (born 4 May 1998), known professionally as Rex Orange County, is an English singer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter. O'Connor rose to prominence in 2017 following multiple features on Tyler, the Creator's Grammy-nominated album Flower Boy, including the single \"Boredom\". NPR Music journalist Zoë Jones has described O'Connor's music as \"a bright blend of hip-hop, jazz, and bedroom pop”. Under the Rex Orange County moniker, O'Connor has released one mixtape, Bcos U Will Never B Free (2015), and three studio albums: Apricot Princess (2017), Pony (2019), and Who Cares? (2022). Both Pony and Who Cares? made the top 5 in the UK and US, and the latter topped the UK Albums Chart. O'Connor also released a live album, entitled Live at Radio City Music Hall, in 2020." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alyssa Michelle Stephens (born December 22, 1998), professionally known as Latto or Big Latto (formerly known as Mulatto), is an American rapper and singer. She first appeared on American rapper Jermaine Dupri's reality television series The Rap Game in 2016, where she was known as Miss Mulatto and won the show's first season, but she rejected the record deal offered as a result of winning the show. After releasing her 2019 single \"Bitch from da Souf\", Latto signed with RCA Records. The song entered the Billboard Hot 100 in August 2020, peaking at number 95. It was accompanied by a remix with rappers Saweetie and Trina. In 2020, Latto released the follow-up single \"Muwop\" (featuring Gucci Mane). Both songs were certified platinum and appeared on Latto's debut album Queen of da Souf, which was released in August 2020. Latto's mainstream breakthrough came with the release of \"Big Energy\", the lead single from her second studio album 777 (2022). Latto's highest-charting single to date, the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Latto received nominations for Best New Hip Hop Artist at the 2020 BET Hip Hop Awards and Top Rap Female Artist at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards. She was a part of the XXL Freshman Class in 2020. She was named MTV Global's Push Artist of the Month in February 2021, and won the BET Award for Best New Artist in 2022. Latto received nominations for Best New Artist, Video For Good, and Best Hip Hop at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards. \"Big Energy\" won Song of the Year, and 777 was nominated for Hip Hop Album of the Year at the 2022 BET Hip Hop Awards." ;

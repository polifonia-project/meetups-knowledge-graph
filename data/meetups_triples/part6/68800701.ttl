        mtp:hasAbstract        "Steve Conway (born Walter James Groom; 24 October 1920 â€“ 19 April 1952) was a British singer who rose to fame in the post-war era. Known for romantic ballads, he made dozens of recordings for EMI's Columbia label, appeared regularly on BBC Radio and toured the UK, before his career was interrupted by his untimely death at the age of 31 from a heart condition. He has been described as \"Britain's first post-war male heart-throb, a masculine equivalent of Vera Lynn in his sincerity and clear diction.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kevin Watson Scott (born 17 December 1966) is an English former football defender. He played over 300 games in the Football League for six different clubs. Starting his career with Newcastle United in 1984, he spent ten years with the club, playing as captain as the club won the First Division title in 1992â€“93. A big money move to Tottenham Hotspur followed in February 1994. However, he did not settle at the club, and instead spent the majority of his three years at the club on loan at Port Vale, Charlton Athletic and Norwich City. He made the move to Norwich permanent in 1997, spending two years at the club before leaving the professional game in 1999, shortly after a loan spell with Darlington." ;

That same year he launched For Orchestra where he arranged pop songs for orchestra. He has arranged covers of songs by Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Pearl Jam, Rimsky-Korsakov, MGMT and PSY, along with others. It has since been featured on Comedy Central Tosh. O, Perez Hilton (for his Lady Gaga arrangements), Green Plastic (for his Radiohead arrangement) and more.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Enrico Brizzi (born in Bologna, November 20, 1974) is an Italian writer. He is best known for his debut novel Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band, which is so far the only one translated into English (along with other 23 languages). It also inspired the same name Italian movie in 1996. Brizzi then published Bastogne, translated to French, German and Spanish, and five more novels for major Italian publishers; the most recent in 2005, Nessuno lo saprà - Viaggio a piedi dall'Argentario al Conero, based on a real life experience of a trekking through Tuscany, Umbria and the Marches from the Tyrrhenian Sea coast to the Adriatic sea one. In Italy, he's one of the most popular authors of his generation, and in 1999 he was elected with José Carreras, Ennio Morricone and seven other Italian celebrities to form \"the ten quality judges' board\" in Italy's biggest music event, the Festival di Sanremo. In 2006 Brizzi walked (and biked) for three months from Canterbury to Rome along the ancient pilgrims' path known as Via Francigena. His reportage was published in issues 30-34 of the leading Italian weekly magazine L'espresso. In 2008 a new trip brought Brizzi from Rome to Jerusalem, walking in southern Italy on the ancient Via Appia, and in Israel on the Israel National Trail. His reportage was published in the Italian edition of Condé Nast Traveler monthly magazine." ;

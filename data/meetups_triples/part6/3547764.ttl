When that constituency was abolished for the 1950 general election, he was elected for the Newton constituency in Lancashire, and sat for that constituency until retiring from Parliament at the February 1974 general election. In 1960, on the death of Aneurin Bevan, he stood as a left-wing candidate for Labour's Deputy Leadership against George Brown and James Callaghan. After Callaghan had been eliminated, Lee was defeated by Brown by 146 votes to 83.

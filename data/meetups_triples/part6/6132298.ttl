        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Moorhead (born 1948) is an Australian historian specializing in late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. A Fellow of the Australian Academy of Humanities, and now an emeritus, he was formerly McCaughey Professor of History at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. Moorhead is best known for his The Roman Empire Divided 400-700, which deals with the post-Roman world. He is also a scholar of Pope Gregory the Great and the teaching of Latin, in which he claims to finally have something in common with â€œthe Venerable Bede.\" His work with religious sources of the period led to an association with the University's Islamic Studies program, in which he lectured on \"Christians, Muslims and Jews in the Middle Ages\". Moorhead is married to Lynn Selepak, originally from Perth, Western Australia. They live in Brisbane." ;

Born in Grimsby, he was educated at the London School of Economics, before working at Her Majesty's Treasury, and later returning to the LSE to lecture on monetary economics in 1964. Between 1966 and 1969, he served as economic advisor to the British Embassy in Washington, then joined the Schroders Bank, as assistant to the Chairman, Gordon Richardson, later Bank of England Governor. He was chairman of the bank Guinness Mahon Holdings between 1987 and 1993. In 1978 he founded the G30 advisory group, after an invitation from representatives of the Rockefeller Foundation, and today remains that group's executive secretary.

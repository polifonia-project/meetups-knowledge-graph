        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cassey Ho Vinh (born in Los Angeles, January 16, 1987) is an American social media fitness entrepreneur with a YouTube channel and a website that sells fitness apparel. In 2013, she received a Shorty Award in the category of social fitness. In 2014, after seeing a photoshopped photo of a model on Targetâ€™s website where the model had an unnatural-looking thigh gap, Ho wrote on her blog calling attention to the health implications of this type of photo editing. Target subsequently apologized for altering the photo. In April 2015, Ho responded to negative comments about her body by creating a YouTube video called The \"Perfect\" Body. In 2017, Ho was listed in Time's third annual list of \"The 25 Most Influential People on the Internet\"." ;

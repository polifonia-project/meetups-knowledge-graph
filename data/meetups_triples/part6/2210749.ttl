Born in Worcester, England, he played for three different teams, and mainly played as a third baseman. After his third season, in 1877 as a member of the Louisville Grays, he was suspended from baseball for the remainder of his life for his part in throwing games for money. He is also the first person born in England to play Major League Baseball." ;

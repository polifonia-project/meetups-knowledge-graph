He was the producer of Roger Waters' album Radio K.A.O.S., along with other recordings with Laurie Anderson (Strange Angels), Pete Wylie (Sinful), Hugh Cornwell (Wolf) and the Big Dish (Swimmer). During the 1980s, he collaborated with English singer/songwriter Gary Numan. Ritchie is married to the jazz and cabaret performer, Holly Penfield. Ritchie is also the composer of \"The Globe Trekker Theme\" (previously known as \"The Lonely Planet Theme\"), the theme music of the travel show Globe Trekker. He is a member of the Liverpool-based theatre rock group Deaf School, and has released a number of singles in the 1980s under the name Miro Miroe. His saxophone playing can be heard on \"See the Day\" by Dee C Lee, \"Club Tropicana\" by Wham!, \"C'est La Vie\" by Robbie Nevil and on his debut jazz album Ian Ritchie's SOHO Project. In 2006â€“2008, Ritchie toured as saxophonist with Roger Waters as part of the backing band on the Dark Side of the Moon Live tour. In 2010, he toured Europe with Australian progressive rock band Unitopia. In 2013, Ritchie released South of Houston, a second jazz album under his own name.

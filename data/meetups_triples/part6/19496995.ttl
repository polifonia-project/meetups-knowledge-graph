He was once the frontman of the German electronic music group Snap! After completing a period of service with the United States Army in Germany, Butler went on tour with The Fat Boys. He was soon discovered by the managers of Snap!, and contributed to the albums World Power and The Madman's Return and their respective number one hits, \"The Power\" and \"Rhythm Is a Dancer\". After leaving Snap!, Butler pursued a solo career and also formed the group Centory, which has several minor hits. Butler is known to tour with other artists who were prominent in the 1990s.

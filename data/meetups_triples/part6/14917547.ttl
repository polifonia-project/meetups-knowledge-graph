        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ron Huberman is an American entrepreneur and current CEO/Co-Founder of Benchmark Analytics, a provider of an evidenced-based public safety management system, featuring early warning and intervention analytics software for law enforcement agencies throughout the U.S. He spent 16 years in Chicago city government, with the first nine years in the Chicago Police Department. He started as a beat cop, advancing to Assistant Deputy Superintendent, where he created one of the country’s most advanced policing technology systems, including community-based strategies to help decrease crime on the streets. He also headed up Chicago’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications, bringing rapid change to that agency following the September 11 attacks on America. He is also the former chief executive officer and superintendent of Chicago Public Schools (2009–2010). Prior to heading the CPS, Huberman served as president of the Chicago Transit Authority." ;

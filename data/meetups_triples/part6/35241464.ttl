Considered as the last known ruler of the Pallavas, he was defeated and killed in c. 897 CE in a battle against Aditya I. The Pallava dynasty rule at Tondaimandalam came to an end thereafter as the Pallava territories were ceded into the Chola Empire. In 880 CE, Aparajita fought a battle against the Pandya ruler Varagunavarman II and had him defeated." ;

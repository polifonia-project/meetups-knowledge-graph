He was instrumental in launching the comedy careers of Rodney Dangerfield, Richard Lewis, Robert Klein, Jay Leno, Andy Kaufman, Freddie Prinze, Steve Landesberg, Jimmie Walker, and for a brief time, managed Bette Midler at the early stages of her career. It was with Friedman's help and guidance that Ms. Midler first appeared on The Tonight Show. He was also an actor and producer. Friedman also opened Improv clubs at other locations including Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula, California, on March 23, 2007, in Los Angeles in 1975, and in Fantasy Springs Resort and Casino in Indio, California." ;

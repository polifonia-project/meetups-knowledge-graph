        mtp:hasAbstract        "Shaun Peter Murphy (born 10 August 1982) is an English professional snooker player who won the 2005 World Championship. Nicknamed \"The Magician\", Murphy is noted for his straight cue action and his long potting. Born in Harlow, Essex and raised in Irthlingborough, North Northamptonshire, Murphy turned professional in 1998. His victory at the 2005 World Championship was considered a major surprise as he was only the third qualifier to win the title after Alex Higgins and Terry Griffiths. His other ranking tournament victories came in the 2007 Malta Cup, the 2008 UK Championship, the 2011 Players Tour Championship Grand Final and the 2014 World Open, while he reached a second World Championship final in 2009, a third in 2015 and a fourth in 2021. He has also won seven non-ranking tournaments, including the 2015 Masters, which completed his career Triple Crown. Murphy has won over £4 million in prize money and has compiled more than 500 century breaks in his professional career. His highest world ranking was number three, which he maintained for three seasons following 2007–08. On 12 November 2017, Murphy won the Champion of Champions title beating Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final. At the 2019 World Snooker Championship, Murphy became only the second person to perform a whitewash at the world championships, defeating Luo Honghao 10–0 in the opening round." ;

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Born and raised in Nashua, New Hampshire, Levesque began his professional wrestling training from 1990 to 1991 and his career from 1992 to 1993 with the International Wrestling Federation (IWF) under the ring name Terra Ryzing. He joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994 was soon after repackaged as a French-Canadian aristocrat named Jean-Paul LÃ©vesque. In 1995 he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), where he became Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and later, Triple H. In WWF, Triple H gained industry fame being a member of The Kliq and co-founding the influential D-Generation X stable, which became a major element of the \"Attitude Era\" in the 1990s. After winning his first WWF Championship in 1999, he became a fixture of the company's main event scene, and was widely regarded as one of the best wrestlers in North America by the turn of the millennium. Triple H has headlined several major WWE pay-per-view events, closing the company's flagship annual event, WrestleMania, on seven occasions. Triple H won a number of championships in his career, being a five-time Intercontinental Champion, a three-time world tag team champion (two World Tag Team Championship reigns, and one Unified WWE Tag Team Championship reign), a two-time European Champion, and a fourteen-time world champion, making him the company's seventh Triple Crown Champion and second Grand Slam Champion. He is also a two-time Royal Rumble match winner, and a King of the Ring tournament winner. Later in his career, Triple H gained notability for his behind-the-scenes work at WWE, creating the developmental branch NXT, and gaining praise for his business acumen in professional wrestling. Outside of wrestling, he has been a figure of substantial media attention due to his marriage to Stephanie McMahon, daughter of Vince McMahon and the CEO of WWE.

Pluto is a graduate of Benedictine High School in Cleveland, and received a degree in secondary education from Cleveland State University, with a major in Social Studies and a minor in English. On August 14, 2007, Pluto announced he was leaving the Beacon Journal to return to The Plain Dealer. He cited the larger circulation and ability to write for his hometown paper as reasons for leaving. Pluto began at The Plain Dealer on September 2, 2007. Since joining The Plain Dealer, Pluto's stories and columns have contributed to the paper becoming a three-time Ohio Associated Press Award winner for Best Daily Sports Section (2007, 2010, 2011 - Division V)" ;

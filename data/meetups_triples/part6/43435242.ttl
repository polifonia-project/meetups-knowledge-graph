Candyâ€™s first collaboration with German DJ and producer Alle Farben, \"She Moves\" (2014), gained him quick popularity with his quirky, high-range vocals, as well as his first gold single. He is currently signed with BMG Rights Management and the Berlin-based label Crazy Planet Records. In 2014, Candy also made his feature-film debut with a lead role in Queen of Carthage, alongside Keisha Castle-Hughes and Shiloh Fernandez." ;

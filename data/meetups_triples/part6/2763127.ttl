        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ferdinand Bruckner (born Theodor Tagger; 26 August 1891, in Sofia, Bulgaria â€“ 5 December 1958, in Berlin) was an Austrian-German writer and theater manager. Although his works are relatively rarely revived, Krankheit der Jugend was put on at the Cottesloe stage of London's Royal National Theatre in 2009, under the title Pains of Youth. It was directed by Katie Mitchell and was met with very mixed reviews. Bruckner's play Die Rassen under the title Race was revived in 2001, in New York, by the Classical Stage Company. The critic John Simon called it \"both scarily suspenseful and heartbreakingly elegant...\" Simon concluded that the play: \" comes as close as anything I know to explaining how a cultured nation hurtled into stupefying barbarity.\"" ;

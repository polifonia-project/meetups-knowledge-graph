        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jens Christian Hostrup (20 May 1818 in Copenhagen â€“ 21 November 1892 in Frederiksberg) was a Danish poet, dramatist and priest. Comforting and encouraging the people, he created poems that filled the hearts of his compatriots. His precise personal and environmental descriptions, as well as succinct dialogue, were welcomed by the critics and contemporaries. His dramas were on current topics such as feminism, free love and home, maybe one of the reasons why he often used the pseudonym Jens Kristrup (Christrup)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Magaye Serigne Falilou Dit Nelson Gueye (born 6 July 1990) is a professional footballer who plays as a forward for Super League Greece 2 club Anagennisi Karditsa. He is a former French youth and under-21 international, but in 2012 he accepted a call up from Senegal for the Olympic games tournament, eligible due to his Senegalese parentage. Gueye started his professional career with RC Strasbourg in France, before moving to Everton in 2010. He made 24 appearances for Everton in four seasons, spending time on loan at Brest, before leaving the club and joining Millwall in 2014. He was a talented sprinter but stopped to focus on his football career. His 100m personal best remains 10.13s." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Michael Brown (4 April 1913 â€“ 23 February 1974) was one of Australia's greatest rugby league footballers. Brown in his distinctive headgear was said to be one of the most admired sights in the game during the 1930s. He won two premierships with Easts and scored so many points, tries and goals and established so many records (some may never be bettered) that he is referred to as \"the Bradman of league\". In 2003 Brown was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame and in 2008 he was named in the New South Wales rugby league team of the century. In 2018, Brown joined Rugby League's elite by being inducted as a Rugby League Immortal." ;

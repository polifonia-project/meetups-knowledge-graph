He is well known for appearing on stage heavily intoxicated at the 2000 BRIT Awards. Friends suggested that he had entered a musical contest and had won Best Musician of the Year, when in fact he had not even been nominated for the award. This resulted in a confrontation with award presenter Ronnie Wood and Thora Birch." ;

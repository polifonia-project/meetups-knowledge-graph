He is probably best known among Western audiences for his cover of \"Upendi\", from The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, as well as work with Deep Forest and his own 1997 hit \"Alane\" produced by Michel Sanchez. In late 2010, he was working on a new project with electronic composer and producer Paul Kwitek. He died on June 25, 2021, in Paris, France, due to a nosocomial infection after a medical operation." ;

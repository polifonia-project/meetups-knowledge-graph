For much of his life he divided his time between Paris and Rome. He was associated with neo-classicism and the \"return to order\" in the decade after the First World War. During his career he worked in a variety of media, including mosaic and fresco. He showed his work at major exhibitions, including the Rome Quadrennial, and won art prizes from major institutions." ;

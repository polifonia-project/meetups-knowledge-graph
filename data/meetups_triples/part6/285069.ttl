        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sarah-Jane Duncanson \"Trinny\" Woodall (born 8 February 1964) is an English fashion and makeover expert, television presenter and author. In 1994, after ten years working in marketing, Woodall met Susannah Constantine, whom she teamed up with to write a weekly fashion column for The Daily Telegraph. This led to the launch of their own internet fashion-advice business and the release of their first fashion-advice book. They were commissioned by the BBC to host What Not to Wear in 2001. The following year Woodall and Constantine released their second book, What Not to Wear, which gained them a British Book Award and sold over 670,000 copies. The pair co-wrote 11 fashion advice books, several of which became best-sellers in the United Kingdom and the United States, and have now sold over 3 million copies worldwide. In 2003 they launched their shapewear range Trinny & Susannah's Original Magic Knickers, which are sold in 30 countries around the world. After co-hosting What Not to Wear for five series and appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show as style and makeover advisors, Woodall and Constantine moved to ITV to host Trinny & Susannah Undress... in 2006, and Undress the Nation. After becoming the faces of Littlewoods Direct, they released their own Littlewoods clothing range along with their 5th fashion advice book, The Body Shape Bible, in 2007. In 2009, they launched their International Makeover Mission series." ;

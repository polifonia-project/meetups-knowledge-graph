He anchored The Close on Canada's financial news network, BNN Bloomberg (formerly Business News Network). He also filed business reports for Toronto all-news channel CablePulse24 and national cable news network CTV News Channel. He is no longer with CTV or BNN, having left mainstream media in 2018 to launch an independent content creation studio. For 8 seasons, Hainsworth also co-hosted the podcast Geeks and Beats with Alan Cross. In September, 2022, Hainsworth relaunched the show as a web series Where's My Jetpack? about the technology we were promised as kids, what we actually got, and what's coming next in which he adopts a \"rant\" style delivery about news of the day tied to science-related topics. His rant Time to Bring Back the Experts has more than 17K views on Twitter." ;

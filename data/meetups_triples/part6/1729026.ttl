Called \"arguably the most influential American classical guitarist of the 20th century\" (Soundboard), Starobin was inducted into the Guitar Foundation of America's Hall of Fame in 2011. He is the only guitarist to have been awarded Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Career Award (1988), and is the dedicatee of more than three hundred new compositions including music by composers Elliott Carter, George Crumb, and Gunther Schuller. Starobin was born in New York City. Starobin performs on both nineteenth century and modern guitars, and has received Grammy nominations as guitarist and as Classical Producer of the Year. In 1981, he founded Bridge Records, a record company which has been honored with 32 Grammy nominations.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Behgjet Isa Pacolli (born 30 August 1951) is a Kosovar Albanian politician and businessman who served as the first deputy prime minister of Kosovo and minister of foreign affairs from 2017 to 2019 under the Ramush Haradinaj's government. Pacolli is a former president of Kosovo, and previously served as the first deputy prime minister of Kosovo between 2011 and 2014. Pacolli was one of the signatories of 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence. Pacolli is regarded as a successful mediator in hostage recovery. In 2004, 2006, and 2007, he negotiated the release of 25 humans who were held hostage by Taliban militants in Afghanistan. He is the major shareholder of Mabetex Group, a Swiss-based construction and civil-engineering company. Pacolli is also the president of the third biggest political party in Kosovo, the New Kosovo Alliance. He is believed to be the world's richest ethnic Albanian. As a young man, Pacolli contacted companies throughout Austria and Germany seeking work and soon after finishing his military service, he joined an Austrian company, for which he worked as a sales representative for ex-Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Poland and Russia. Two years later, he moved to Switzerland and joined a Swiss company he had gotten to know in Moscow." ;

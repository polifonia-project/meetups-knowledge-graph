        mtp:hasAbstract        "Barry Ryan (born Barry Sapherson; 24 October 1948 – 28 September 2021), and also known as Barry Davison, was a British pop singer and photographer. He achieved his initial success in the mid 1960s in a duo with his twin brother Paul. After Paul ceased performing to concentrate solely on songwriting, Barry became a solo artist. Barry's most successful hit, \"Eloise\", reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1968. In the mid-1970s, Barry began his 40-year career as a fashion and portrait photographer. He worked for magazines such as Italian Vogue and David Bailey’s Ritz; he sold six photographs to the National Portrait Gallery; and he made portraits of celebrities such as Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Stephen Hawking, Sting, Paul McCartney, and Björk." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard W. DiPietro Jr. (born September 19, 1981) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender and current co-host of ESPN 98.7 FM's \"DiPietro and Rothenberg\" with Dave Rothenberg. He is also an analyst on National Hockey League (NHL) telecasts on ESPN having started the 2021–22 season. On June 24, 2000, DiPietro became the second goaltender in history selected first overall in an NHL Entry Draft when he was chosen by the New York Islanders. In 2006, the team signed him to a groundbreaking 15-year, $67.5 million contract, but a string of injuries beginning in 2008, which limited him to 50 NHL appearances over the next five seasons, led to a contract buyout on July 2, 2013, with eight years remaining on his contract. DiPietro retired after being released by the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League (AHL) on November 26, 2013, with whom he had signed a tryout contract on October 25. Multiple hockey writers consider him to be one of the biggest draft busts in NHL history. As a result of his contract buyout, the Islanders will continue to pay DiPietro $1.5 million annually until the end of the 2028–29 season." ;

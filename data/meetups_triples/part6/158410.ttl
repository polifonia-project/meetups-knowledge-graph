        mtp:hasAbstract        "Oleg the Prophet (Old East Slavic: Ѡлегъ Olegŭ; Old Norse: Helgi; Russian: Олег Вещий, romanized: Oleg Veshchy, lit. 'Oleg the Prophet'; Ukrainian: Олег Віщий, romanized: Oleh Vishchyi) was a Rurikid prince who ruled all or part of the Rus' people during the late 9th and early 10th centuries. He is credited by Rus' Chronicles with moving from either Staraya Ladoga (Old Norse: Aldeigjuborg) or Novgorod, and seizing power in Kiev from Askold and Dir, and, by doing so, laying the foundation of the powerful state of Kievan Rus'. He also launched an attack on Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. According to East Slavic chronicles, Oleg was the supreme ruler of the Rus' from 882 to 912. This traditional dating has been challenged by some historians, who point out that it is inconsistent with such other sources as the Schechter Letter, which mentions the activities of a certain khagan HLGW (Hebrew: הלגו usually transcribed Helgu) of Rus' as late as the 940s, during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Romanus I. The nature of Oleg's relationship with the Rurikid ruling family of the Rus', and specifically with his successor Igor of Kiev, is a matter of much controversy among historians." ;

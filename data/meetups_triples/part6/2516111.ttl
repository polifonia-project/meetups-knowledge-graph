He and vocalist Mac Powell were the only original members present throughout the band's entire history. Third Day has amassed album sales of over 6 million units. Lee has performed over 1200 shows with the band, traveling throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil and South Africa.

As a songwriter, Lee has co-written over 20 number-one songs with Third Day. He is the principal writer of \"Sky Falls Down\" and \"Alien\", both named GMA Rock Song of the Year; and \"Show Me Your Glory\", the 2003 ASCAP Song of the Year. Lee has written songs with or for numerous other artists, including Matthew West, Kim Hill, Bart Millard, and Steven Curtis Chapman. \"Strong Tower\", Lee's collaboration with Kutless, became a #1 hit and the title track of their album of the same name.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Emilio Jacinto y Dizon (Spanish: [eˈmi.ljo xaˈsinto]; December 15, 1875 – April 16, 1899) was a Filipino general during the Philippine Revolution. He was one of the highest-ranking officers in the Philippine Revolution and was one of the highest-ranking officers of the revolutionary society Kataas-taasan, Kagalang-galang na Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan, or simply and more popularly called Katipunan, being a member of its Supreme Council. He was elected Secretary of State for the Haring Bayang Katagalugan, a revolutionary government established during the outbreak of hostilities. He is popularly known in Philippine history textbooks as the Brains of the Katipunan while some contend he should be rightfully recognized as the \"Brains of the Revolution\" (Filipino: Utak ng Himagsikan, a title that is usually given to Apolinario Mabini). Jacinto was present in the so-called Cry of Pugad Lawin (or Cry of Balintawak) with Andrés Bonifacio, the Supremo (Supreme President) of the Katipunan, and others of its members which signaled the start of the Revolution against the Spanish colonial government in the islands." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frank Peterson (born 29 December 1963) is a German music producer known for his work with Enigma and artists such as Sarah Brightman, Ofra Haza, Gregorian, Princessa, and Andrea Bocelli on his first international album, Romanza. Peterson was born in Hamburg. As a child, he taught himself to play the piano and keyboard, going on to work in a music store. It was here that he met Michael Cretu and became lead keyboardist for Sandra, appearing prominently on her hit single \"Maria Magdalena\". He was a member of Sandra's band for a few more years, then moved with the Cretus to Ibiza. While there, he became involved with Cretu's new project, Enigma, under the pseudonym of F. Gregorian. Peterson contributed to their first album, MCMXC a.D., writing several tracks. He left the group in 1991 and pursued work on Gregorian, a musical project co-founded by Thomas Schwarz and Matthias Meissner. The female vocals for this album were provided by The Sisters of Ozâ€”a duo composed of Birgit Freud and Susana Espelleta, who was married to Peterson at the time. Soon after, he met English soprano Sarah Brightman and collaborated with her on her solo albums Dive through Symphony. Gregorian was re-invented later on in Peterson's career as a group performing Gregorian chant arrangements of popular songs. Peterson's inspiration, as he stated in an interview, was the approaching new millennium and its spiritual aspect. In 1997, Peterson collaborated with Israeli singer Ofra Haza, producing her last album, Ofra Haza. Other artists whom Peterson has worked with include Princessa, Carolin Fortenbacher, Violet, and Sinsual." ;

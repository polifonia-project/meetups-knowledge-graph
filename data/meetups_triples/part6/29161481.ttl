At the age of 14, she was heard in an amateur contest and asked to audition for a network teen-aged show called \"Junior Junction\". At 16 she was signed to a recording contract. She recorded over 40 sides, including the half million best seller \"Only You\" in 1955. Her popularity as a recording artist gave her the opportunity to tour with such stars as Bob Hope, Johnnie Ray and Jimmy Durante in the late 1950s and 1960s." ;

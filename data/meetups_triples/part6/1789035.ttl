        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jan-Håkan \"Ian\" Haugland (born 13 August 1964) is the drummer in the Swedish rock band Europe. When he was eight months old, he and his family moved to the Stockholm suburb of Märsta, Sweden. He joined Europe in the summer of 1984, replacing Tony Reno. Previously Haugland had played in a number of bands, including Trilogy, where Candlemass bassist Leif Edling sang, and Yngwie J. Malmsteen's band Rising Force. After Europe went on hiatus in 1992, Haugland recorded and toured with bands like Brazen Abbot, Clockwise, Last Autumn's Dream, Europe colleague John Norum and former Black Sabbath / Deep Purple vocalist Glenn Hughes. In 1998 Haugland recorded a cover version of the Black Sabbath song \"Changes\", for the Ozzy Osbourne tribute album Ozzified. When he's not on the road or in the studio, he works as a host on the radio channel 106.7 FM Rockklassiker in Stockholm and occasionally plays drums in the studio. As a drummer he endorses Ludwig drums, Paiste cymbals, Evans heads and Promark sticks." ;

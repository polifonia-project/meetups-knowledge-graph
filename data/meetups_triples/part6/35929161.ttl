        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon (20 March 1895 – 20 April 1955), born in Trinidad and Tobago, was a physician, parliamentarian, civil-rights activist and labour leader in Bermuda, and is regarded as the \"father of trade unionism\" there: \"he championed the cause of Bermudian workers and fought for equal rights for black Bermudians, thereby laying the groundwork for much of the political and social change that came about after his death\". He was president of the Bermuda Industrial Union (BIU) 1945–55. Gordon has been described as \"perhaps the only black charismatic leader to have emerged in the island's modern political history\", and as \"Bermuda's most dedicated Pan-Africanist\". In 2011, Gordon was honoured as a National Hero of Bermuda. Other posthumous honours he has been accorded include the Peace & Social Justice Award 2016 from the Roman Catholic Church of Bermuda." ;

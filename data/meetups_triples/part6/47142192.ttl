        mtp:hasAbstract        "Melinda Kae Wilson (n√©e Ledbetter, born October 3, 1946) is an American talent manager who is the second wife and longtime manager of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. She was formerly a model and car saleswoman. Ledbetter is credited with helping to initiate Wilson's court-ordered separation from his former psychologist, Eugene Landy, and leading Wilson to proper medical care. Her account of her early relationship with Wilson was dramatized for the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy, in which Ledbetter is portrayed by Elizabeth Banks." ;

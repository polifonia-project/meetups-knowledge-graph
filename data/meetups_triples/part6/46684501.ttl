She received several awards from major South African jazz competitions. In 2000 she won the old mutual jazz encounters for Cape region and in 2001 she received a merit award for young promising talent at the Daimler Chrysler South African jazz competition. When she completed her vocal studies at the music college of the University of Cape, a recording contract from a major South African music record label was already offered to her but she turned it down. She accepted a greater opportunity offered by Dutch pianist – who was living and teaching in Cape Town at the time – to go and study in Europe and enhance her career as a jazz vocalist and a performer.

She then relocated to Antwerp in Belgium, her current home where she’s working steadily on her career. Tutu was the recipient of the standard bank young artist of the year award for music in 2004. She released two albums with her Europe band, first album called Song 2007 and second album called Quiet Now in 2009 which won the SAMA Award for the 2010 Best Traditional Jazz Album. Both albums were received very well internationally which led to Miss Puoane’s receiving an invite from the Brussels Jazz Orchestra to work with them. The musical journey between Tutu and Brussels Jazz Orchestra resulted in to a creation of an album titled Mama Africa celebrating the Music Icon Miriam Makeba; this album scored them a SAMA for Best Traditional Jazz Album of 2011.

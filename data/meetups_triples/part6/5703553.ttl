        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bob Humid (also known as Robert Feuchtl) is a producer, DJ, sound-designer and mastering-engineer in the Cologne electronic music and studio-scene. His musical work expands from electronic breakbeats to experimental electronica while occasionally touching the area of club music and pop. He describes his own music as \"Eclectica\". He was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, but grew up in Germany for most of the time. He was one third of the Electronic Body Music / Synthpop-Formation \"Der Liederkranz\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He has organised and co-organised many activities in Cologne's electronic music underground including \"Mos Eisley\" (with DJ Tetsuo), \"Twist'n'Shout\" (with Uh-Young Kim), \"Is It Now?\", \"Radical Love Area\", \"Vectrax\" (with Telekolleck), \"Propellor Knights\", \"Lights! Lights!\" and \"BASScadets\" (with Snork and Dan_K). He has also run the two record labels named Bored Beyond Belief (1995–along with Wolfgang Schreck from Big Noise fame) and Serve & Destroy Recordings, the latter being his own label platform. Currently he is one of the resident-DJs of \"Ehrenfeld Calling\", a colognian monthly event featuring both breakbeat and techno-orientated music. Bob Humid was also the technological editor for the German for almost six years as a successor to Christian Rindermann (aka C-Rock). He gained reputation in the German Keyboards / Sound & Recording Magazine where he worked as a technological author as well. Along testing studio and DJ gear he is a producer with an affinity for detail. Over the years he has gained a growing reputation as a dedicated mastering engineer. Under the credit of his own studio \"Fat Of Excellence\", which he runs together with Numinos, he mastered countless records for Boxer Sport, Mathias Schaffhaeuser's Ware Records, Pagoda London, Plasteline, Audiolith, Patrick Alavi, Kitbuilders, Dan Curtin, Plemo, Der Tante Renate, Bratze and many other independent labels and artists. His work also includes sound design for various companies such as Native Instruments, Magix (Samplitude, Sequoia) and U-He (Satin). His more recent works are productions for the highly acclaimed Leipzig-based band Brockdorff Klang Labor for whom he produced half of the tracks of the album \"Die Fälschung der Welt\", along with one of Germany's most known producers for alternative music, Tobias Levin. Over the time, Bob Humid has worked, produced, and remixed with such people and groups as: twila.too, Carla Subito, Holger Czukay (Can), Fabian Stall (Zero Cash), Oliver Twist Kooperationen, Brockdorff Klanglabor, Igor Sirodzha, Daniel Myer (Dots And Dashes, Haujobb), Bernhard Deissler (Videos), Alexander Gerdes, Numinos, , Mathew Mercer, Carlsbop, Der Liederkranz, Decomposed Subsonic (aka Valour), Uh-Young Kim, Telekolleck (British Botschaft), , Djamel Laroussi and Mathias Schaffhäuser (Ware Records)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Warrick Swinney (born in 1958), more commonly known as Warrick Sony, is a South African composer, producer, musician and sound designer. He is the founder and sole permanent member of the Kalahari Surfers. They made politically radical satirical music in 1980s South Africa, and released it through the London-based Recommended Records. During this time the Surfers toured Europe with English session musicians. Sony has produced albums, and ran the Shifty Music label at BMG (Africa) for two years in the mid-1990s. He has also worked as a film sound recordist, sound designer and sound artist. Now based in Cape Town, Sony has released more Kalahari Surfers albums, and been involved in art, music and DJ events in the city. He currently works on film scores, music for theatre and sonic art exhibitions. He graduated with a Master of Fine Art degree in 2019 from Michaelis School of Art University of Cape Town." ;

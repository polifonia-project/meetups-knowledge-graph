        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hiromi Iwasaki (岩崎 宏美, Iwasaki Hiromi, born November 12, 1958) is a Japanese female singer who debuted in 1975. Her younger sister Yoshimi Iwasaki is also a singer. In 1981 she was awarded the Silver Prize at the Tokyo Music Festival for her song \"Koimachigusa\". Her representative songs are \"ロマンス\" — \"Romance\" (1975), \"思秋期\" — \"Shishūki\" (1977) and \"聖母たちのララバイ\" — \"Madonna Tachi No Lullaby\" (1982). However, her most immediately recognizable hit song, \"シンデレラ・ハネムーン\" — \"Cinderella Honeymoon\" (1978) has been such a consistent feature of monomane talent Korokke's routines, Hiromi Iwasaki has commented that when the intro played in concerts, fans would laugh, so she has ceremonially \"gifted\" that song to Korokke, whose performance has elongated both their careers." ;

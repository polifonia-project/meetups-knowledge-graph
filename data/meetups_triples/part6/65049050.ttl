        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mafumafu (Japanese: まふまふ, Hepburn: Mafumafu, born 18 October 1991) is a Japanese singer. In addition to his solo work, he is a vocalist, lyricist and composer in the music duo After the Rain formed with fellow utaite singer Soraru. Mafumafu is also popularly known as Nandemoya (Japanese: 何でも屋, lit. Jack of all trades). His broad vocal range, spanning well over five octaves, allows him to sing in a high register comparable to some Vocaloid songs; with some covers, he has also adopted the name Manunchan (まぬんちゃん) for his \"female persona\", who has an even higher voice. His image color is white. His 2D image has a signature appearance of white hair and a barcode on his left cheek. His youtube channel has over 3 million subscribers. His videos have over 2.0 billion combined views. Mafumafu plays guitar and piano. He covers Vocaloid songs from other creators as well as performing his own original songs. He also produces music for games, anime, and other artists. On 5 June 2022, Mafumafu announced on Twitter that after his solo live concerts on 11 and 12 June in the Tokyo Dome, he would go on an indefinite hiatus from all personal musical activities as Mafumafu for the first time in 11 years, citing his medical condition. He will remain active as a musician to produce music for other artists, as well as continue to participate in group collaborations." ;

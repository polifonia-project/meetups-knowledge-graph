        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeanette Aw Ee-Ping (born 28 June 1979), better known by her stage name Ou Xuan (欧萱), is a Singaporean actress, filmmaker, businesswoman and writer. Aw was named as one of the Seven Princesses of Mediacorp in 2006, after which she achieved wider success with her leading role in acclaimed drama The Little Nyonya. She was prominently a full-time Mediacorp artiste from 2002 to 2017 but continues to film on an ad-hoc basis and was once managed under Hype Records. Through her television career, Aw has established herself as one of the most popular and high-profile celebrities in Singapore. She has won 29 popularity and performance awards, the record number for a performer, at Singapore Mediacorp's Star Awards. Aw has published two books; Jeanette Aw: Definitions in 2012 and Sol's World: Somebody to Love in 2015. She also starred in musical Beauty World in 2015. While in college, Aw entered TV talent scouting competition Route to Glamour, in which she placed first. She signed on with SPH Mediaworks and made her acting debut in the 2001 drama Touched. Aw then signed on to Mediacorp in 2002 and played the intellectually challenged character Mo Jingjing in Holland V (2003). Aw garnered critical appreciation for portraying flawed actress, Zhao Fei Er, in The Dream Makers (2013) and its 2015 sequel. She won her first Best Actress award at the Star Awards for her performance in the latter drama. In mid-2021, Aw is slated to open her first pastry shop, Once Upon A Time, located at Hamilton Road, Jalan Besar." ;

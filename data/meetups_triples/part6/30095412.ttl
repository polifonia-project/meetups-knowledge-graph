He was leader of the New Spirit Party, which merged into Vetëvendosje in 2011, and served as their vice chairman. However, after internal disputes he left the party in 2018 to become the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Kosovo. In 2019 he became an independent politician. Ahmeti lectured public policy at the American University in Kosovo before he became mayor. In the first round of elections on 3 November 2013, Ahmeti was around 8,000 votes behind Isa Mustafa, but in the second round on 1 December 2013 he won by around 2,500 votes.

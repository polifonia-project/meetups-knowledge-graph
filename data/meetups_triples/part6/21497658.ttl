        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Johnstone (1719 â€“ c. 1791), also known as Chevalier de Johnstone or Johnstone de Moffatt, was the son of an Edinburgh merchant. He escaped to France after participating in the 1745 Rising; in 1750, he was commissioned in the colonial army and served in French North America. His military career was undistinguished and he remained a Lieutenant after ten years of service. Following the loss of Quebec in 1760, he returned to France and left the army. There are few details on his later life and he is thought to have died sometime after 1791. He is best remembered for his Memoirs of the rebellion in 1745 and 1746, first published in 1820." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tim Scott McConnell aka Tim Scott or Footless (born March 23, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter and 12-string guitarist who performs since 2007 under the artist name Ledfoot and created the music genre Gothic blues. He calls himself the \"Master of Gothic Blues\". The artist's repertoire consists solely of self-written songs. Two of his songs gained international popularity through other artists: \n* \"Swear\" was covered by Sheena Easton for her 1984 album A Private Heaven. \n* Bruce Springsteen recorded one of his songs, \"High Hopes\", on the Blood Brother EP (1996). The song, released by Springsteen as a single in November 2013, gave the title to his January 2014 studio album. McConnell started touring at the age of 15. He got his first recording contract with Sire Records in 1982. He then recorded for Geffen on his next record in 1985, called \"High Lonesome Sound\". McConnell headed the LA-based band The Havalinas. The band recorded one album and a live album called Go North. After the break-up of The Havalinas, McConnell did a series of solo albums and toured with a band. In 2007, he released his first Ledfoot album and started touring heavily in Europe solo. He plays mainly solo with the Ledfoot project up until today. Since 2010 Ledfoot has had a close musical relationship with Ronni Le Tekr√∏ that culminated in the 2020 duo album A Death Divine." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Philip Brown (born 30 May 1959) is an English former professional footballer and coach who was most recently the manager of Barrow. As a player, Brown was a right-back who made over six hundred league appearances in an eighteen-year career, but never made it to the top flight. However, as a manager, he became the first to lead Hull City to the top division in their 104-year history, winning the Championship play-offs in 2008 after a 1–0 win against Bristol City at Wembley Stadium. He also guided Southend United to promotion from League Two to League One in 2014–15. Since 2011, Brown has appeared as a match summariser on BBC Radio 5 Live." ;

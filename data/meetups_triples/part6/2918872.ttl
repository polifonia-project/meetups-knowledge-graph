Roecker is probably best known for Live Freaky! Die Freaky!, a stop motion animated comedy based on the true crime book Helter Skelter. From 1996 to 1999, Roecker and Exene Cervenka co-owned Los Angeles store \"You've Got Bad Taste.\" The store specialized in kitsch and various \"off-color\" novelties, such as paintings by serial killer and rapist John Wayne Gacy and a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wanted poster of bank robber Patty Hearst . He recently released an album with collaborator Dylan Melody titled Rocker|Melody on Frontier Records. A music video was created for every track on the album. Next, Roecker and Melody are collaborating on a musical about Charles Manson." ;

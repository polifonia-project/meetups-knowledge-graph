        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sir Ian Holm Cuthbert CBE (12 September 1931 â€“ 19 June 2020) was an English actor who was knighted in 1998 for his contributions to theatre and film. Beginning his career on the British stage as a standout member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, he later transitioned into a successful and prolific screen career. On film he portrayed a variety of both supporting and leading characters, earning critical acclaim and many accolades in the process. Holm won the 1967 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor for his performance as Lenny in The Homecoming and the 1998 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his performance in the title role of King Lear. He was nominated for seven BAFTA Awards, winning Best Actor in a Supporting Role twice for The Bofors Gun (his film debut) and Chariots of Fire (as a running coach). His latter performance as athletics trainer Sam Mussabini was also nominated for an Academy Award. His other well-known film roles include Ash in Alien, Mr Kurtzmann in Brazil, Francis Willis in The Madness of King George, Father Vito Cornelius in The Fifth Element, Mitchell Stephens in The Sweet Hereafter, the voice of Chef Skinner in Ratatouille, and elderly Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Antony Price is an English fashion designer best known for evening wear and suits, and for being as much an \"image-maker\" as a designer. He has collaborated with a number of high-profile musicians, including David Bowie, Robert Palmer, Iva Davies, Steve Strange, and Duran Duran, but especially Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music, whose look was defined by Price's designs. The manner in which Price dressed – or in many cases, undressed – the \"Roxy girls\" on the covers of their albums helped to define the band's pop retro-futurism. More recently, Price has been noted for dressing celebrities such as Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Patsy Kensit, Anjelica Huston, Jerry Hall, Camilla Parker Bowles. Diana Ross, Melanie Griffith, Yasmin Le Bon and burlesque performer Dita Von Teese." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "José Ángel López Martínez (born April 25, 1994), known by his stage name Jay Wheeler, is a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter. Wheeler first became widely known after a video of him singing went viral in 2016, after which he began pursuing a career as a musician. Signing with Dynamic Records in 2018, his debut album Platónico was released the following year, executively produced by DJ Nelson. His second effort, Platónicos, again produced by DJ Nelson, was released in 2020, and contained the successful single \"La Curiosidad\" featuring Myke Towers, which peaked at #5 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Darius Albert Delfín Dasig (June 10, 1963 – March 13, 2012), more widely known as Bodjie Dasig, was a Filipino singer, songwriter and music producer. He first came into prominence for writing the song \"Ale (nasa Langit Na ba Ako)?\" (\"Ma'am [Have I Gone to Heaven]?\") and \"Maáalala Mo Pa Rin\" (\"You'll Still Remember\") for singer Richard Reynoso, and \"Ayo' ko Na Sana\" (\"I Wish I Didn't Have To\") for Ariel Rivera. He also wrote and sang the hit song \"Sana Dalawa ang Puso Ko\" (\"I Wish I Had Two Hearts\") for his band Bodjie's Law of Gravity, which became the theme song of a movie with the same name in 1994. He also collaborated with his wife Odette Dasig (née Quesada), whom he married in 1993. Dasig died in a Los Angeles hospital on March 12, 2012 after a long bout with cancer. He was survived by Odette and their son Darian." ;

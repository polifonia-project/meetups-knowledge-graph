        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Solomon Gudinski AM (22 August 1952 â€“ 2 March 2021) was an Australian record executive and promoter who was a leading figure in the Australian music industry. Born and raised in Melbourne to Jewish Russian immigrants, Gudinski formed the highly successful Australian record company Mushroom Records in 1972 through which he signed several generations of Australian musicians and performers ranging from MacKenzie Theory, the Skyhooks, The Choirboys, Kylie Minogue, and New Zealand's Split Enz to newer artists such as Eskimo Joe, Evermore and others. Gudinski was considered to be \"one of the most significant and powerful players\" in the Australian music landscape." ;

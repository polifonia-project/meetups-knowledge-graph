        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gregory Mcdonald (February 15, 1937 â€“ September 7, 2008) was an American mystery writer whose most famous character is the comedy investigative reporter Irwin Maurice \"Fletch\" Fletcher. Two of the Fletch books earned Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America: Fletch was named Best First Novel in 1975, and Confess, Fletch won for Best Paperback Original in 1977. This is the only time a novel and its sequel won back-to-back Edgars. Mcdonald would go on to write nine more Fletch novels, including prequels Fletch Won, Fletch Too, and Fletch and the Widow Bradley. The original book became a 1985 movie of the same name starring Chevy Chase." ;

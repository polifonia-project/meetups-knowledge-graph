        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Leo McCarey (October 3, 1898 â€“ July 5, 1969) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. He was involved in nearly 200 films, the most well known today being Duck Soup, Make Way for Tomorrow, The Awful Truth, Going My Way, The Bells of St. Mary's, My Son John and An Affair To Remember. While focusing mainly on screwball comedies during the 1930s, McCarey turned towards producing more socially conscious and overtly religious films during the 1940s, ultimately finding success and acclaim in both genres. McCarey was one of the most popular and established comedy directors of the pre-World War II era." ;

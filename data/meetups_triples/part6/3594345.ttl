        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martina Eileen Hernandez delas Alas-Sibayan (born November 11, 1964), known professionally as Ai-Ai delas Alas, is a Filipino actress and comedian. She is widely regarded as the country's \"Queen of Comedy\" for her comedic talent and best known for her role in the film Ang Tanging Ina (2003), which became a blockbuster hit. On account of the film's popularity, a television series spin-off was produced, as well as three sequels: Ang Tanging Ina N'yong Lahat (2008), Ang Tanging Ina Mo (Last na 'To!) (2010) and Enteng ng Ina Mo (2011), with delas Alas reprising her role. She also appeared in the comedy film Our Mighty Yaya, which premiered on May 10, 2017, through Regal Entertainment." ;

He is the CEO and co-founder (with his wife, Sunni) of JaSunni Productions, LLC, whose documentary films include Charles Beaumont: The Short Life of Twilight Zone’s Magic Man, the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award-winning The AckerMonster Chronicles!, and Image, Reflection, Shadow: Artists of the Fantastic. He is also the author of Totems and Taboos, a compilation of his poetry and artwork; and an editor, along with William F. Nolan, of The Bleeding Edge: Dark Barriers, Dark Frontiers and The Devil's Coattails: More Dispatches from the Dark Frontier anthologies published by Cycatrix Press. Brock shares story credit (he was Lead Story Consultant and Lead Designer) on the Logan’s Run: Last Day and related comic book series from Bluewater Productions. He is also a writer for the comic book/graphic novel, Tales from William F. Nolan's Dark Universe (also from Bluewater). He served as Managing Editor/contributor and Art Director for Dark Discoveries magazine for over four years. His novella, Milton’s Children, was published by Bad Moon Books in early 2013. In addition to award wins and nominations, Brock's work has generally been well-received, and his poetry, short stories, nonfiction articles, introductions and essays have been widely published internationally online, as well as in dozens of horror, science fiction and fantasy books and scholarly print magazines (Fangoria, Dark Discoveries, Calliope, Comic-Con International's Souvenir Book, the Weird Fiction Review [print edition], American Rationalist [an organ of the Center for Inquiry], etc.), and multiple anthologies working with a wide array of publishers and editors (Butcher Knives and Body Counts, S. T. Joshi's Black Wings series, Matt Cardin's Teeming Brain website and his book Horror Literature Through History, Animal Magnetism, and so on). A content expert in multiple areas, he has been a frequent special guest and panelist at many horror and science fiction conventions (such as Necronomicon-Providence, MythosCon, Norwescon, Crypticon, World Horror Convention, World Fantasy Convention, and others) and film festivals (including the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival, Buffalo International Film Festival, Lovecraft's Visions, etc.). He has also been a guest lecturer and speaker at various colleges and universities (including at the invitation of James E. Gunn to the University of Kansas Center for the Study of Science Fiction). In 2015, at the invitation of author Greg Bear, Brock and Nolan contributed writings, along with others, as examples from significant Washington State authors to the Washington Centennial Time Capsule. A sealing ceremony was held in the state capital of Olympia, Washington. In late 2015, he was featured as the Editor Guest of Honor at the largest science fiction convention in Oregon, OryCon 37." ;

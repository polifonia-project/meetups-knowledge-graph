        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Paul Hawkins (12 October 1937 â€“ 26 May 1969) was an Australian motor racing driver. The son of a racing motorcyclist-turned-church minister, Hawkins was a capable single-seater driver but really made his mark as an outstanding sports car competitor driving Ford GT40s and Lola T70s. In 1969 Hawkins was included in the FIA list of graded drivers, an elite group of 27 drivers who by their achievements were rated the best in the world. Hawkins was hugely popular and known as Hawkeye; the son of a gentleman of the cloth he was a colourful character with a wide colourful vocabulary. He was also famous for being one of two racers to crash into the harbour at the Monaco Grand Prix." ;

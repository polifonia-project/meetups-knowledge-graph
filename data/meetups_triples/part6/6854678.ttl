        mtp:hasAbstract        "Laura \"Luann\" Bambrough (April 28, 1964 â€“ March 17, 2014), known professionally as L'Wren Scott, was an American model, fashion designer and stylist. Scott started her career as a model in Paris before moving to California and styling movie stars such as Madonna and Julia Roberts. In 2006, she launched the first of her fashion collections, characterised by sumptuous femininity combined with unconventional touches, aimed at establishing a well-defined silhouette. She issued regular tips on etiquette, known as \"L'Wrenisms\", and extended her range into shoes, handbags, glasses, makeup and perfume. In 2013, she collaborated with Banana Republic on a line of affordable ready-to-wear holiday items. Scott's longest relationship was with Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, whom she met in Paris around 2001. In 2014, following a period of severe depression, Scott was found dead in her home, from a suicide by hanging." ;

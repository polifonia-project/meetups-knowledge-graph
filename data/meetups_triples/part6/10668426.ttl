        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Friedberg, better known by the stage name Freebo, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and producer noted primarily for his work with Bonnie Raitt. He is also a session musician who has recorded and performed with Ringo Starr, John Mayall, John Hall, Aaron Neville, Dr. John, Willy DeVille, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Maria Muldaur, Kate & Anna McGarrigle and many others. His nine-year collaboration with Raitt (1971-1979) began when he attracted Raitt's attention as a member of Philadelphia's Edison Electric Band in the late 1960s. Freebo was soon in great demand for studio work and touring. In recent years, he has recorded five solo albums: The End Of The Beginning (2000), Dog People (2002), Before The Separation (2006), Something to Believe (2011), and If Not Now When (2015)." ;

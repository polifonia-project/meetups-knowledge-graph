Jeffries has represented New York's 8th congressional district, anchored in southern and eastern Brooklyn, since 2013, and is expected to become minority leader when the incoming Republican majority elects a new Speaker in January 2023. Before his election to Congress in 2012, Jeffries served three terms in the New York State Assembly, representing the 57th district, and worked as a corporate lawyer. He has chaired the Democratic caucus since 2019, and was elected unopposed to succeed Nancy Pelosi as its leader in November 2022." ;

Born in Amsterdam, Brautigam studied there with Jan Wijn (1971-79), then he left to study in London with John Bingham (1980-82) and in the United States with Rudolf Serkin (1982-83). His skill as a pianist was recognised by Dutch musicians and in 1984 he was awarded the Nederlandse Muziekprijs. In 2015 his Beethoven recordings received the Edison Award and the annual German Record Critics' Prize. Brautigam lives in Amsterdam with his wife Mary. Since September 2011 he has been a professor at the University of Music of the Basel Music Academy." ;

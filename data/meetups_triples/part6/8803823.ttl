        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Q. Kolderie is an American record producer, engineer, and mixer. He has worked with Pixies, Radiohead, Orangutang, Hole, Dinosaur Jr., Juliana Hatfield, Wax, Warren Zevon, Uncle Tupelo, Throwing Muses, Morphine, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Abandoned Pools, the Go-Go's, and Mike Gordon of Phish. He usually works with production partner Sean Slade. Kolderie and Slade were friends from Yale University, where they played in bands together. They also became members of Sex Execs, a Boston-based new wave music band of the early 1980s. The duo had their formative experience as producers while they were in Sex Execs. Most of the group lived in a house in Dorchester, Boston that was wired up as a primitive studio. Other bands came over to record as well, including a local act called Three Colors, which featured saxophonist Dana Colley, later of Morphine. As Sex Execs became more successful, they started recording in professional studios such as Syncro Sound, which was owned by The Cars. Kolderie learned a lot from the engineers there. He got to record an EP for Three Colors at Syncro, earning his first production credit. In 1985, Kolderie and Slade helped create Boston's Fort Apache Studios with Jim Fitting, another friend from Yale and Sex Execs, as well as musician-producer Joe Harvard. Kolderie has also played in Detroit-based cowpunk band, Goober & the Peas, and contributed to Raisins in the Sun." ;

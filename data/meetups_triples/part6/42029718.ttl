He taught at Mercyhurst College, Buffalo State College, UCLA, the University of Utah, University of California, Riverside, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and the University of Vermont before moving to Buffalo in 2004 as chair of its American Studies Department, now part of the Transnational Studies Department for which he is now director of graduate studies. He has published widely on Native American topics, with a particular emphasis on study of the Iroquois Confederation (Haudenosaunee). Grinde and Bruce E. Johansen became known for their works showing a connection from the Great Law of Peace of the Iroquois to the drafting of the United States Constitution.

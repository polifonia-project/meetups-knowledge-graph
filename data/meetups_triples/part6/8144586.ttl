He moved to London in 1974 and studied fine art at Hornsey Art College from 1977 to 1980, where Adam Ant was his contemporary. He became an assistant to the photographer Red Saunders in 1980 and soon branched out as a photographer in his own right, primarily in the pop music business. From 1981 to 1986 he was one of the main photographers for \"Smash Hits\" magazine where his friend Neil Tennant was assistant editor. When Tennant formed the Pet Shop Boys with Chris Lowe, Watson took the first photographs of them and was their main photographer and video director from 1984 to 1991. The first video he directed was \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\" for the Pet Shop Boys in 1985, his co-director being Andy Morahan.

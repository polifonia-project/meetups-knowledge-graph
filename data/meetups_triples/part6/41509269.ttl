        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Hye-ri (Korean: 이혜리; born June 9, 1994), better known mononymously as Hyeri, is a South Korean actress, singer, and television personality. She rose to fame as the youngest member of girl group Girl's Day, and was named as the \"Nation's Little Sister\" by the South Korean media due to her immense popularity after appearing as a fixed cast member on Real Men (2014). She later became known for her award-winning performance as the female lead in Reply 1988 (2015), which was the highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history at the time. After back-to-back success in variety and the small screen, Hyeri ranked third in Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list in 2016 and became one of the highest-paid commercial models in South Korea. Hyeri was a regular cast member on Amazing Saturday (2018–2020). After leaving the show to focus on her acting career, Hyeri starred in the popular iQiyi series My Roommate Is a Gumiho (2021)." ;

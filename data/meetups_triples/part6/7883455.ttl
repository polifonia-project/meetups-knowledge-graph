        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Rolland, né Pali Reisman (November 21, 1911, Budapest – November 9, 1978, Illinois), was a violinist and an influential American violin teacher who concentrated on the pedagogy of teaching fundamentals to beginning string students and on remedial techniques for string players of any level. He was famous for emphasizing that the physical demands of most violin techniques can be taught (\"in embryonic form\") in the first two years of violin education. He advocated that teachers learn and teach freedom of movement and use clear, specific and concise instructions when teaching. His approach to pedagogy was extremely analytical, and his teaching approach was highly systematic and logical. His wife, Clara Rolland, said of his work \"Every possible movement in string playing was analyzed.... Different methods do indeed exist, but none more fundamental.... Paul never harmed anyone's playing. He helped a person through certain body movements and the knowledge of what those body movements meant physically, in the scientific way of playing the violin.\"[Cite]" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Steven Roberts (6 February 1942 â€“ 10 December 2012) was an English designer and fashion entrepreneur who operated prominent independent retail outlets including pop art boutique, Mr Freedom, and the 1980s decorative arts and homewares store, Practical Styling. In 1969, Roberts was the first fashion business executive to license images from Walt Disney Productions, Ltd., and in 1972, he was the first fashion retailer to establish an outlet in London's Covent Garden. Roberts's shops sold designs worn as stagewear by Jimi Hendrix, Elton John, Mick Jagger and David Bowie. In the mid-1970s, he was the manager of the pub rock group Kilburn & the High Roads fronted by Ian Dury. Later in life, Roberts promoted sales of collectibles, artefacts and furniture through London outlets Tom-Tom and Two Columbia Road." ;

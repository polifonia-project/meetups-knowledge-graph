        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles E. Allen (May 1, 1942 â€“ May 7, 1990) was one of the founding members of blues and rock outfit Pacific Gas & Electric and the vocalist for the group. By 1968, the group consisted of Charlie Allen, Frank Cook, Tom Marshall, Brent Block, and guitarist Glenn Schwartz. Besides being remembered for his association with Pacific Gas & Electric, Allen is perhaps best remembered for the hit single \"Are You Ready?\" that he co-wrote with John Hill which besides being a hit for Pacific Gas & Electric has been covered by The Staple Singers, and DeGarmo and Key." ;

He made his film debut in 2006 in Dibakar Banerjee's comedy drama film Khosla Ka Ghosla, which won the National Film Award For Best Feature Film in India. Despite its small budget, upon release the film was a commercial success. Although Inderpal Singh just had a small cameo in the movie, he was later signed up for two bigger budget movies – Vicky Donor as taya ji and Besharam as bhura paaji." ;

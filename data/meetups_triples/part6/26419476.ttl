        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Crabtree (30 April 1930 – 2 February 1976) known by his stage name Danny Ross, was a British comedian best remembered for his role alongside Jimmy Clitheroe in the long running BBC Radio comedy show The Clitheroe Kid (1957–1973). Ross played the part of \"Alfie Hall\", the dim witted, mismatched boyfriend of Jimmy's posh sister \"Susan\" (Diana Day). Alfie Hall was a name Danny Ross had used prior to The Clitheroe Kid, including during a television series in 1956 entitled I'm Not Bothered... which followed the exploits of milkman \"Alf Hall\" and his stuttering mate, \"Wally Binns\" (Glenn Melvyn). The phrase \"I'm not bothered...\" was occasionally used by Danny Ross in The Clitheroe Kid as a catchphrase, in indecisive (but not unfriendly) responses when given a decision by girlfriend \"Susan\". Danny had made his reputation in comedy by starring alongside Arthur Askey and Glenn Melvyn in The Love Match – a hit stage comedy presented for a summer season at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool, in 1953, that led to the spin-off TV series Love and Kisses. He had also starred in the George Formby role in the revival of the stage musical Zip Goes a Million, and later made a pop record of Formby's hit song \"The Old Bazaar in Cairo\"." ;

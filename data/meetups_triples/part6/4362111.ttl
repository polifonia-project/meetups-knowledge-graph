        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harry Richard Bailey (29 October 1922, Picton, New South Wales â€“ 8 September 1985, Mount White, New South Wales) was an Australian psychiatrist and hospital administrator. He bore the primary responsibility for treatment of mental health patients and drug dependent clients via deep sleep therapy and other methods at a mental hospital in the Sydney North Shore suburb of Pennant Hills; he was its principal. The treatment has been linked with the deaths of a total of 85 patients, including 19 who committed suicide. Bailey committed suicide while he was being investigated. One of Bailey's clients was Australian rock and pop singer and songwriter Stevie Wright, who was being treated for methadone addiction, a report that was later part of a 2013 documentary on Australian Story." ;

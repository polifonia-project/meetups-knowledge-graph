        mtp:hasAbstract        "Geoff Kresge is a songwriter, guitarist, bassist, and record producer. He played with the punk rock/horror punk band AFI for most of their early career, from 1992 through 1997, and co-wrote the majority of their early material alongside frontman Davey Havok. During an AFI hiatus in 1993, he briefly moved to New York to join street punk band Blanks 77. He later went on to play with Canadian horror rock group The Forbidden Dimension and also a high-energy rock band, The Daggers, before subsequently joining the psychobilly band Tiger Army. Though he played an electric bass in his previous bands, for Tiger Army he chose an upright bass." ;

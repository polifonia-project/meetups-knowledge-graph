        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jozef Kroner (20 March 1924 in Staškov – 12 March 1998 in Bratislava) was a Slovak actor. His brother Ľudovít Kroner, daughter Zuzana Kronerová, and wife Terézia Hurbanová-Kronerová were also actors. He starred in the Oscar-winning film The Shop on Main Street, and in more than 50 other Slovak films, as well as in several Czech, Bulgarian and Hungarian productions. He never studied acting; his career started in amateur theater troupes. His biography Jozef Kroner's Tracks (Trate Jozefa Kronera) was produced by director Fero Fenič in 1987. Jozef Kroner is also an author of several mostly autobiographic books." ;

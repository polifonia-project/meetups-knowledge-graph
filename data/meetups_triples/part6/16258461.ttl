        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bogislaw IV (c. 1255 – 19 or 24 February 1309), of the House of Griffin, was Duke of Pomerania from 1278 until his death in 1309. Bogislaw was the eldest son of Duke Barnim I by his second wife, Margaretha, sometimes said to be a daughter of King Eric X of Sweden. He was an adult at his father's death in 1278, having been co-ruler since 1276. His half-brothers Barnim II and Otto I were still very young and so he was sole ruler in Pomerania during their minority. In the early 1280s Bogislaw was involved in the war in the neighbouring margraviate of Brandenburg. In 1295, Barnim II died and Pomerania was divided into two parts, with Bogislaw receiving Wolgast and Otto receiving Szczecin (Stettin). In the 14th century, he was allied with would-be King of Poland Władysław the Short. He was unsuccessfully involved in the opening stages of the decade-long Brandenburg War. He died in 1309 leaving his share of Pomerania to his son Wartislaw. He is buried in Marienkirche in Stettin." ;

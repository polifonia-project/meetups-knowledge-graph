She is a recipient of several awards, including four South Filmfare Awards, six South Indian International Movie Awards and two Andhra Pradesh State Nandi Awards. She has established herself as one of the leading actresses in Telugu and Tamil cinema. Samantha worked part-time on modeling assignments while pursuing a degree in commerce. She soon received offers for film roles and made her acting debut in Gautham Vasudev Menon's critically acclaimed Telugu romance film, Ye Maaya Chesave (2010), which fetched her the Filmfare Award for Best Debut Actress and a Nandi Award. Samantha then became the second actress ever to win both the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Tamil and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu in the same year, for her performances in the films Neethaane En Ponvasantham (2012) and Eega (2012). Since then, she has primarily opted to appear in the leading female role in hero-centric Telugu and Tamil films, earning box office success with films including Dookudu (2011), the family dramas Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2012) and Attarintiki Daredi (2013) and AR Murugadoss's Tamil action film, Kaththi (2014).

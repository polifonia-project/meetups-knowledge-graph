        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rebecca Walker (born November 17, 1969, as Rebecca Leventhal) is an American writer, feminist, and activist. Walker has been regarded as one of the prominent voices of Third Wave Feminism, and the coiner of the term \"third wave\", since publishing a 1992 article on feminism in Ms. magazine called \"Becoming the Third Wave\", in which she proclaimed: \"I am the Third Wave.\" Walker's writing, teaching, and speeches focus on race, gender, politics, power, and culture. In her activism work, she helped co-found the Third Wave Fund that morphed into the Third Wave Foundation, an organization that supports young women of color, queer, intersex, and trans individuals by providing tools and resources they need to be leaders in their communities through activism and philanthropy. Walker does extensive writing and speaking about gender, racial, economic, and social justice at universities around the United States and internationally. In 1994, Time named Walker as one of the 50 future leaders of America. Her work has appeared in publications including The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, Salon, Glamour, and Essence and has been featured on CNN and MTV." ;

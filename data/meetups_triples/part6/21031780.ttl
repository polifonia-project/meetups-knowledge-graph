        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hana Gabrielle Pestle (born July 11, 1989), known mononymously as Hana (/ˈhɒnə/ HON-ə; stylized in all caps), is an American musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. She is currently based in Los Angeles. Hana began working on music in 2006, with the help of producers and writers Ben Moody and Michael \"Fish\" Herring. Her early work was largely acoustic-based, utilizing the guitar, which Hana plays. During this period, she recorded under her full name Hana Pestle. As Hana Pestle, she released three extended plays—Hana Pestle (2008), Live in the Studio (2009), and For the Sky (2011)—and one full-length album titled This Way (2009). In 2013, upon befriending producer BloodPop, Hana chose to take a break from recording to focus on learning music production. Dissatisfied with the music she was making, she decided to rebrand herself and change the direction of her music. In 2015, she re-emerged on the music scene with the single \"Clay\"; now recording under the mononym Hana. Her debut body of work as Hana, the self-titled Hana EP (2016), saw her explore a more electronic style. In November 2019, Hana released her second studio album, Hanadriel. The album was made in four weeks, and the creation process was live streamed by Hana via Twitch. In addition to her solo work, Hana is also known for her frequent work with musician Grimes. She has performed as a live backing vocalist and band member for Grimes, and the pair have collaborated on songs and music videos." ;

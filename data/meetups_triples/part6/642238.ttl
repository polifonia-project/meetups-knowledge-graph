        mtp:hasAbstract        "Matthew Paul Clement (born August 12, 1974) is a former Major League Baseball starting pitcher. Clement played for the San Diego Padres (1998–2000), Florida Marlins (2001), Chicago Cubs (2002–2004) and Boston Red Sox (2005–2006). While on the Red Sox active roster, he was injured all of the 2007 season. He batted and threw right-handed. Clement had a sinking fastball in the low 90s and a hard slider he mixed with a four-seamer and a changeup. In nine seasons, Clement won 87 games and lost 86, and was 1–2 in post-season play, going 1–1 with the Cubs in 2003 and 0–1 with Boston in 2005. His win in Game 4 of the 2003 National League Championship Series at Florida brought the Cubs within one game of the pennant. He held opposing batters to a .233 batting average from 2002 to 2005, while posting a 47–42 record and a 3.99 ERA." ;

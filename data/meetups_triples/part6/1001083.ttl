        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maxim Sozontovich Berezovsky (Russian: Макси́м Созо́нтович Березо́вский , Ukrainian: Максим Созонтович Березовський, romanized: Maksym Sozontovych Berezovskyi; c. 1745(?) — 2 April 1777) was a composer, opera singer, bassist and violinist, who studied in Italy and worked at the St. Petersburg Court Chapel in the Russian Empire. He was one of the first Russian Imperial composers in the 18th century to be recognized throughout Europe and the first to compose an opera, symphony, and violin sonata. His most popular works are his sacred choral pieces written for the Orthodox Church. Much of his work has been lost; only three of the eighteen known choral concertos have been found. Dmitry Bortniansky was thought to be the first Russian Imperial symphonic composer until the discovery in 2002 of Berezovsky's Symphony in C by Steven Fox in the Vatican archives, composed around 1770 to 1772." ;

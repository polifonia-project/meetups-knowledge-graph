        mtp:hasAbstract        "Adam Harper is a mathematician specialising in number theory, particularly in analytic, combinatorial and probabilistic number theory, and serving as Assistant Professor with University of Warwick, England. Harper was awarded the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize in 2019 \"for several outstanding contributions to analytic and probabilistic number theory.\" This annual prize is awarded for outstanding contributions by individuals not exceeding the age of 32 in areas of mathematics influenced by Srinivasa Ramanujan. The age limit has been set at 32 because Ramanujan died at the age of 32 years. \"Harper's research, both individually and in collaboration, covers the theory of the Riemann zeta function, random multiplicative functions, S-unit equations, smooth numbers, the large sieve, and the recent highly innovative \"pretentious\" approach to number theory. In establishing these results, he has shown mastery over probabilistic methods which he has used with remarkable effect in analytic number theory.\"" ;

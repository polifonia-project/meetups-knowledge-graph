        mtp:hasAbstract        "Asra Quratulain Nomani (born September 7, 1965) is an American author and former Georgetown University professor. Born in India to Muslim parents, she earned a BA from West Virginia University in liberal arts in 1986 and an MA from the American University in international communications in 1990. She subsequently worked as a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal with her colleague Daniel Pearl in Pakistan post-9/11. Pearl was kidnapped and murdered by Islamist terrorists while following an investigative lead. Nomani later became the co-director of the Pearl Project, a faculty-student investigative-reporting project which has looked into Pearl's murder. Nomani is the author of two books: Standing Alone: An American Woman's Struggle for the Soul of Islam and Tantrika: Traveling the Road of Divine Love. Articles include: \"Islamic Bill of Rights for Women in the Bedroom\", the \"Islamic Bill of Rights for Women in the Mosque\", and \"99 Precepts for Opening Hearts, Minds and Doors in the Muslim World\". She has also written for The Washington Post and has been a returning guest on Real Time with Bill Maher. Her story forms part of the documentary The Mosque in Morgantown, aired nationwide on PBS as part of the series America at a Crossroads. She is currently a senior contributor to The Federalist. Nomani has described herself as an advocate of Islamic feminism and a critic of Islamism." ;

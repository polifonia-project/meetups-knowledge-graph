        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kenley Geronimo Jansen (born September 30, 1987) is a Cura√ßaoan professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves. Signed by the Dodgers as an undrafted free agent in 2004, Jansen converted from a catcher to a relief pitcher in the minor leagues, and made his major league debut in 2010. He served as the Dodgers' closer since 2012, and led the National League (NL) in saves in 2017. After 11 years in the major leagues with the Dodgers, he entered free agency and signed a one-year deal with the Braves. Jansen is a three-time MLB All-Star and two-time NL Reliever of the Year (2016, 2017). In 2019, Jansen became the 30th pitcher to reach 300 career saves." ;

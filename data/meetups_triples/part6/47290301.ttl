        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sergiu Floroaia (born December 1, 1984), known professionally by the mononym Sergiu, is a Romanian stand-up comedian and comedy writer. He is one of the first Romanians to be featured on Comedy Central Extra, with six comedy specials. He hosted, together with Andrei Ciobanu, the morning show on Romanian radio station Kiss FM (Romania). His style of humour is based on topical events, dark humour and the use of edgy one-liners. Sergiu started doing comedy in 2006 at an open-mic night in Cafe Deko. His early influencers were Steven Wright, Demetri Martin, Jimmy Carr and later Anthony Jeselnik. In 2013, Sergiu partnered with Andrei Ciobanu, also a comedian, and wrote \"Unu-ntr-altu'\" and \"Mica rugÄƒminte\", two musical parody videos that became instant hits on YouTube." ;

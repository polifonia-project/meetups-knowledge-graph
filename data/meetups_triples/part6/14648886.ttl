        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Chinnock (November 12, 1947 â€“ March 7, 2007), also referred to as Bill Chinnock or Billy Chinnock, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. Born in Newark, New Jersey, Chinnock grew up in the nearby Essex County communities of East Orange and Millburn. He was a prominent member of the Jersey Shore music scene during the late 1960s, leading bands that included future members of the E Street Band. He subsequently moved away from the Shore and spent time in New York City and Nashville, Tennessee, before eventually settling in Yarmouth, Maine. In 1987 he won an Emmy Award after his song \"Somewhere in the Night\" was used as the theme on Search for Tomorrow. \"Hold On To Love\", a duet he recorded with Roberta Flack, was also featured as a theme song on Guiding Light." ;

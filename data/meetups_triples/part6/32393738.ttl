There she won gold medals in both the women's F35-38 javelin throw and the F35-36 discus throw event. She also finished second in the women's shot put - F35-36. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, Wu competed in F35-F36 shot put and discus events. In the shot put event, she broke the World Record for her F36 classification; she was awarded bronze behind F35 competitors Mariia Pomazan and Wang Jun who broke the World Record for their own classification. In the discus throw, Wu set a new F36 world record to win the event. A scoring error saw Mariia Pomazan initially presented with the gold medal, then being told to return it. Outside of sport, Wu's hobbies include embroidery and listening to music." ;

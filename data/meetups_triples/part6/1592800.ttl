        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bernart de Ventadorn (also Bernard de Ventadour or Bernat del Ventadorn; c. 1130–1140 – c. 1190–1200) was a French poet-composer troubadour of the classical age of troubadour poetry. Generally regarded as the most important troubadour in both poetry and music, his 18 extant melodies of 45 known poems in total is the most to survive from any 12th-century troubadour. He is remembered for his mastery as well as popularization of the trobar leu style, and for his prolific cançons, which helped define the genre and establish the \"classical\" form of courtly love poetry, to be imitated and reproduced throughout the remaining century and a half of troubadour activity. Now thought of as \"the Master Singer,\" he developed the cançons into a more formalized style which allowed for sudden turns. Bernart was known for being able to portray his women as divine agents in one moment and then, in a sudden twist, as Eve – the cause of man's initial sin. This dichotomy in his work is portrayed in a \"graceful, witty, and polished\" medium." ;

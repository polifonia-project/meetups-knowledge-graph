        mtp:hasAbstract        "Duncan McCargo is a British academic who is serving as Director of the Nordic Institute of Asian Studies and Professor of Political Science at the University of Copenhagen. He is currently a Visiting Professor in the School of Politics and International Studies at the University of Leeds, where he was a faculty member from 1993 to 2020. Between 2015 and 2019 he held a shared appointment at Columbia University, where he was a Visiting Professor of Political Science and taught every spring semester. McCargo is also a visiting scholar at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University, and an associate fellow of the New-York-based Asia Society. He attended Sandbach School and later gained three degrees from the University of London: a First in English (Royal Holloway 1986); then an MA in Area Studies (Southeast Asia) (1990) and a PhD in Politics (1993) from the School of Oriental and African Studies. He was an undergraduate exchange student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. McCargo has also taught at Queen's University, Belfast, and at Kobe Gakuin University, Japan. In 2006–2007, he was a visiting senior research fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore. During the 2015–16 academic year, he was a Visitor at the School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. McCargo is best known for his writing on contemporary Thailand and Asia-related topics. His work deals mainly with the nature of power: how entrenched elites seek to retain it, and how challengers seek to undermine their legitimacy." ;

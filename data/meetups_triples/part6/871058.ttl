Her films are often made in black and white and cover various aspects of female sexuality, including BDSM and fetishism. She was inspired by expressionist German cinema, French surrealism, and American film noir. She sometimes stars in her own films, such as The Elegant Spanking (1995) and The Black Glove (1997). In 2007, she won the FICEB Tacón De Aguja Best Director Award for Silken Sleeves. Annie Sprinkle’s 1992 production The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop – Or How To Be A Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps was co-produced and co-directed with Beatty. It featured music by composer Pauline Oliveros." ;

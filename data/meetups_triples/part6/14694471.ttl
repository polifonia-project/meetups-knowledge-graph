        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lawrence Godfrey Burton (born December 15, 1951) is a former professional American football player and world-class Olympic sprinter, finishing fourth for the United States team in the 200 meter final at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games. He held the world record in the 60-yard dash at 5.9 seconds. As a Senior at Purdue University, he finished his season with 38 catches for 702 yards (18.5 YPR) and 4 TD. He led the Big 10 in catches, receiving yards, and was 2nd in yards per reception. He was named to numerous All-American teams. Burton was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the first round (7th overall) of the 1975 NFL Draft; a wide receiver from Purdue University, he played in the NFL for five seasons for the Saints and the San Diego Chargers between 1975 and 1979. Despite having over 250 receiving yards in each of his first two seasons, he was never able to become a regular starter for any team." ;

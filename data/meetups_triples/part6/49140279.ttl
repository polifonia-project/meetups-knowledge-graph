He accompanied some of the most famous singers of the time such as Manolo Caracol, Juan Valderrama, Fosforito, and Enrique Morente. He was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album in 2000. Habichuela received the Latin Grammy Trustees Award in 2012 for \"significant contributions, other than performance, to the field of recording during their careers\"." ;

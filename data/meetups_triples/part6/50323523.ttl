        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tyka Evene Nelson (born May 18, 1960) is an American singer. She is the daughter of jazz musician John L. Nelson (1916–2001) and jazz singer Mattie Della Shaw (1933–2002), and the sister of Prince (1958–2016). In addition, she has seven half-siblings. She has released four albums, and reached No. 33 on the Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in July 1988 with \"Marc Anthony's Tune\", produced by Larry Graham. She wrote the tune \"Marc Anthony\" because she had a crush on the singer. She accepted Prince's American Music Award for Top Soundtrack following his death in 2016. Nelson is married to Maurice Phillips. She has 6 children." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Geraldo José Rodrigues Alckmin Filho (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʒeˈɾawdu ˈaɫkmĩ]; born 7 November 1952) is a Brazilian politician who is the vice president-elect of Brazil. He previously served as the Governor of São Paulo from 2001 to 2006, and then again from 2011 to 2018. He was the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) presidential nominee for the 2018 Brazilian presidential election, when he finished in fourth place, as well for the 2006 Brazilian presidential election, when he came in second place, losing in the runoff to then president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He is usually described by political analysts and supporters as a pro-business centrist, closely associated with the political and financial establishment. Alckmin attended the Universidade de Taubaté's medical school, specializing in anesthesiology, before going on to work in the São Paulo Public Service Hospital. Alckmin was elected governor of São Paulo in 2010 and reelected in 2014, for the fourth (not consecutive) time. He resigned on 6 April 2018 to run for president for a second time in the 2018 elections. His vice governor Márcio França held the office until the end of the term on 1 January 2019. In 2021, Alckmin left PSDB after 33 years with the party and joined the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) the following year to be Lula's running mate in the 2022 Brazilian presidential election. On 30 October 2022, Lula beat Bolsonaro in the presidential election, making Alckmin vice president-elect." ;

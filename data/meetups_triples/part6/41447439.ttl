        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexander Albon Ansusinha (Thai: อเล็กซานเดอร์ อัลบอน อังศุสิงห์; RTGS: Aleksandoe Anbon Angsusing, pronounced [ʔà lék saːn dɤː ʔan bɔːn ʔaŋ sùʔ sǐŋ], born 23 March 1996) is a Thai-British racing driver currently competing in Formula One for Williams Racing, under the Thai flag. Albon previously raced in Formula One for Scuderia Toro Rosso and Red Bull Racing and in DTM for AF Corse. After becoming part of the Red Bull Junior Team in 2012, he was promoted to open-wheel cars for the 2012 Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 season. He spent three years in the series and finished third in the 2014 championship. He moved to the FIA Formula 3 European Championship in 2015, where he finished seventh. He signed with ART Grand Prix to contest the 2016 GP3 Series and ended the season as runner-up behind teammate Charles Leclerc. In 2017 Albon moved up to the FIA Formula 2 Championship with ART, where he finished his maiden year tenth in the standings. He then switched to the DAMS team for 2018, winning four races and finishing third in the championship. He made his Formula One début in 2019 with Toro Rosso alongside Daniil Kvyat. After twelve races, Albon was promoted to Red Bull Racing, partnering Max Verstappen and replacing Pierre Gasly. He took his first podium finish – and the first in a World Championship Formula One race for a Thai driver – at the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix. After two seasons in Formula One, Albon was demoted to a test and reserve driver role with Red Bull for 2021 and his seat was taken by Sergio Pérez. Albon returned to Formula One in 2022, driving for Williams, with which he is due to stay for 2023." ;

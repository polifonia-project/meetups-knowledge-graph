He is known as one of the most prominent and influential philosophers, theologians, jurists, logicians and mystics of the Islamic Golden Age. He is considered to be the 5th century's mujaddid, a renewer of the faith, who, according to the prophetic hadith, appears once every 100 years to restore the faith of the Islamic community. His works were so highly acclaimed by his contemporaries that al-Ghazali was awarded the honorific title \"Proof of Islam\" (Ḥujjat al-Islām). Al-Ghazali believed that the Islamic spiritual tradition had become moribund and that the spiritual sciences taught by the first generation of Muslims had been forgotten. This belief led him to write his magnum opus entitled Iḥyā’ ‘ulūm ad-dīn (\"The Revival of the Religious Sciences\"). Among his other works, the Tahāfut al-Falāsifa (\"Incoherence of the Philosophers\") is a landmark in the history of philosophy, as it advances the critique of Aristotelian science developed later in 14th-century Europe." ;

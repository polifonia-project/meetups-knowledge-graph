        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Harris (born 20 February 1964) is a British journalist and former politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow South, formerly Glasgow Cathcart, from 2001 to 2015. A former member of Scottish Labour, he left the party in August 2018. Since 2021 he has been lead non-executive director of the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland and Advocate General for Scotland. Harris first entered government when he was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Transport in September 2006 by PM Tony Blair. When Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in June 2007, Harris kept his junior ministerial role but, in the October 2008 reshuffle, he was sacked and returned to the backbenches. On 9 June 2009, he was the first Scottish Labour MP to call for Gordon Brown to stand down as prime minister. Harris was a candidate in the 2011 Scottish Labour leadership election, but effectively admitted defeat on 10 December a week before the result was declared. In 2012, he returned to Ed Miliband's frontbench as shadow environment minister but left in June 2013 to spend more time with his family, being succeeded by Barry Gardiner." ;

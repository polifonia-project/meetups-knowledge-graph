        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chūya Nakahara (中原 中也, Nakahara Chūya, 29 April 1907 – 22 October 1937), born Chūya Kashimura (柏村 中也, Kashimura Chūya), was a Japanese poet active during the early Shōwa period. Originally shaped by Dada and other forms of European (mainly French) experimental poetry, he was one of the leading renovators of Japanese poetry. Although he died at the young age of 30, he wrote more than 350 poems throughout his life. Many called him the \"Japanese Rimbaud\" for his affinities with the French poet whose poems he translated in 1934." ;

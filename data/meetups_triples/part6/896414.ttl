        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alec James Stewart OBE (born 8 April 1963) is an English former cricketer, and former captain of the England cricket team, who played Test cricket and One Day Internationals as a right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman. He is the fourth-most-capped English cricketer ever in Test matches and third-most-capped in One Day Internationals (ODIs), having played in 133 Tests and 170 ODIs. An attacking batsman in tests against the new ball, Stewart is regarded as one of England's greatest openers. Legendary Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram considers him one of the most difficult batsmen he ever bowled to." ;

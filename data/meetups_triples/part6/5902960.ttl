Other projects include Circus Devils, Kramies, The Library Is On Fire, and musical theater composer and lyricist George Griggs. Tobias began producing albums in 2002, first working with indie rock pioneers Guided By Voices on their album Universal Truths And Cycles. One year earlier in 2001, Tobias joined Guided By Voices front man Robert Pollard and brother Tim Tobias in the psychedelic rock trio Circus Devils (2001-2017). In 2012, Tobias began recording solo albums of instrumental, atmospheric mood music ranging in style from ambient to post-rock. Todd's debut album Medicine Show, released on Hidden Shoal Recordings. has been described as \"a multi-faceted instrumental opus, evoking a shadowy steampunk dystopia.\" In 2013, Tobias released I RAZOR, a soundtrack album for the experimental film of the same name, followed by Impossible Cities in 2014 and Tristes Tropiques in 2015. Todd's EP Moorea was featured in John Diliberto's NPR program Echoes' top 25 in September, 2015. In 2018, Tobias joined with English vocalist and songwriter Chloe March on the ambient album Amialluma, on which vocalist March invented a language to accompany Tobias' music. Also in 2018, the self-titled debut from the psychedelic rock duo Moonchy & Tobias was released, featuring music composed by Tobias and vocals/lyrics by Italian vocalist Pat Moonchy. Other collaborations include The World Of Dust with Dutch musician Stefan Breuer, and Brother Earth with Steve Five." ;

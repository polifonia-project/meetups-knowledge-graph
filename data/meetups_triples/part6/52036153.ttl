        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Ellsworth Morris (born December 11, 1984), is an American professional wrestler, better known by the ring name James Ellsworth. He is best known for his tenure with WWE. Ellsworth began his career in 2002 and worked for 14 years on the independent circuit as Jimmy Dream. In 2016, he had a squash match against Braun Strowman in WWE. He became famous with the quote “any man with two hands has a fighting chance” After this appearance, he became very popular with the fans and, months later, WWE signed him to a contract. He was subsequently featured in a high-profile storyline between Dean Ambrose (currently AEW's Jon Moxley) and then- WWE Champion AJ Styles. Later, he began a storyline where he became the manager of Dolph Ziggler. After his departure from WWE in 2018, he created his own championship, dubbed the Intergender Championship, which he defended in various promotions on the independent circuit." ;

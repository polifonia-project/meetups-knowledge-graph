        mtp:hasAbstract        "LeGarrette Montez Blount (/ˈlʌɡærɛt ˈblʌnt/; born December 5, 1986) is a former American football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He played college football at Oregon after transferring from East Mississippi Community College. Not selected in the 2010 NFL Draft, he began his NFL career as an undrafted free agent. Blount achieved his greatest success during his four nonconsecutive seasons with the New England Patriots, where he won two Super Bowl titles and led the league in rushing touchdowns during the 2016 season. Following his victories for New England in Super Bowl XLIX and Super Bowl LI, Blount was part of the Philadelphia Eagles team that won Super Bowl LII, making him one of six players to have consecutive Super Bowl titles for different franchises. He scored 11 playoff rushing touchdowns, which are tied for the sixth-most in NFL history." ;

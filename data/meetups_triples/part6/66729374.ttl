        mtp:hasAbstract        "Trevor Carter (October 1930 â€“ March 2008) was a leading British communist activist, educator, and black civil rights activist, most famous for co-founding the Caribbean Teachers Association and serving as the Head of Equal Opportunities for the Inner London Education Authority. Carter was the stage manager of the first British-Caribbean Carnival, held in St Pancras Town Hall, and later a Trustee of the Notting Hill Carnival Trust. His skills within the field of education led to the first Premier of British Guiana, Cheddi Jagan, personally inviting Carter to Guiana to perform educational work. Several historians of British socialist movements have described Carter as \"one of the Communist Party of Great Britain's (CPGB) most important black members\" from the mid-1950s until 1991. Carter was the cousin of fellow black civil rights leader and communist activist Claudia Jones, and the husband of EastEnders actress Corinne Skinner-Carter, all of them playing essential roles in establishing the second largest annual carnival in the world, London's Notting Hill Carnival. Carter was a lifelong communist activist, and a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) from his arrival to Britain in 1954 until the party was dissolved in 1991." ;

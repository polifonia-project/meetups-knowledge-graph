Her work is primarily influenced by folk, rock, pop and soul music. In addition to being a vocal activist for songwriters, Wood is recognized for her contributions as a recording arts leader and mentor by AES and NAMM presenting alongside Grammy winning Leslie Ann Jones and Lenise Bent. She has been highlighted in two UK published Routledge academic books as a trailblazer in the professional music engineering and producer community: “Women in Audio” and “Gender in Music Production” in Chapters 4 (Sound for Television and Film) and 13 (Perspective Through a Female and Feminine Lens) respectively. In 2022, Wood was elected to The Recording Academy Los Angeles Chapter Board of Governors." ;

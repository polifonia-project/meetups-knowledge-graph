        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Jason Hanley (born 12 November 1977) is a retired professional male tennis player from Australia, specialising in doubles and owning 26 ATP titles in this discipline. He made the 2005 Wimbledon and 2011 Australian Open finals in mixed doubles, playing with Tatiana Perebiynis and Chan Yung-jan respectively, falling short on both occasions. His best results came alongside Wayne Arthurs and Kevin Ullyett, with whom Hanley formed long-term doubles partnerships. Hanley has an 8–4 win–loss record on the Australian Davis Cup Team. The Australian's highest doubles ranking was World Number 5. His parents, Jay and Judy, co-own a tennis centre, which is one of the main reasons why Hanley pursued a career in the sport." ;

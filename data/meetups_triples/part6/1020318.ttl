        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edmund John Phillip Browne, Baron Browne of Madingley, FRS, FREng, FGS (born 20 February 1948) is a British businessman. He is best known for his role as the chief executive of the energy company BP between 1995 and 2007. This period has been described as the company's \"golden period of expansion and diversification\". Browne was lauded during this period as he engineered mergers with rival Amoco and ARCO, and gained access to Russian oil reserves with the creation of TNK-BP. Nicknamed the \"Sun King\" for his management style, he was also praised for transforming the oil and gas industry's approach to climate change, and for creating a renewable and alternative energy business within BP. He resigned from BP in May 2007 in controversial circumstances surrounding his personal life. He is a former president of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2006 to July 2011), and has served on the boards of Goldman Sachs, Intel and Daimler Benz. Since 2001, he has been a crossbench member of the House of Lords. Lord Browne is a former partner at Riverstone, where he was co-head of the world's largest renewable energy private equity fund. He received his undergraduate education at the University of Cambridge and later attended Stanford University." ;

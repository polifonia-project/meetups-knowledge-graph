        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jess Stonestreet Jackson Jr. (February 18, 1930 â€“ April 21, 2011) was an American billionaire wine entrepreneur, lawyer, racehorse owner, and self-made businessman. He started the Kendall-Jackson wine business with his first wife, Jane Kendall (Wadlow) Jackson. The family's 1974 purchase of an 80-acre (32 ha) pear and walnut orchard in Lakeport, California was converted to a vineyard. The first release of Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay in 1982 closed the gap between the super premium and cheap wine market. As of 2010, Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay was one of the most popular wines on the market. His style as a vintner developed into a focus on single-vineyard, mountain grown wines." ;

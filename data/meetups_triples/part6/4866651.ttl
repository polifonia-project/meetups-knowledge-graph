        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tilo Wolff (born 10 July 1972) is a German musician and artist. He was born in Frankfurt am Main and currently lives in Switzerland. His longest-running project is the band Lacrimosa, which since its debut in 1990 has produced 11 albums. The band embraces a diverse range of gothic, darkwave and orchestral musical styles. Wolff composes, arranges, and writes the lyrics for almost all of Lacrimosa's songs. He also sings and plays piano for the songs and has contributed to the design of the album sleeves' designs. The same year Lacrimosa was founded, Wolff founded the independent record label, \"Hall of Sermon\" to finance Lacrimosa without being dependent on outside record companies. Hall of Sermon now has eight darkwave bands other than Lacrimosa on its books, including Dreams of Sanity and Girls Under Glass. In 2004, Wolff founded Snakeskin, another band, which diverts significantly from Lacrimosa's music. Wolff was also the manager of the German band Cinema Bizarre. He also DJs, playing festivals and clubs across Europe." ;

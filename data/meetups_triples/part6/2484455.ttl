He was born in Halmstad in south-west Sweden and played in the Sweden men's national handball team between 1964 and 1972. He is better known as being the coach for the Swedish team from 1988 to 2004. His nickname was Bengan, a common nickname in Sweden for people named Bengt. He was recognisable by his Halmstad dialect way of speaking.

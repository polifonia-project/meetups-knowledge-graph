        mtp:hasAbstract        "Azealia Amanda Banks (/əˈziːliə/ ə-ZEE-lee-ə; born May 31, 1991) is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. Raised in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, she began releasing music through Myspace in 2008 before being signed to XL Recordings at age 18. In 2011, her debut single \"212\" went viral and entered several international charts. Banks subsequently signed with Interscope and Polydor Records before later separating in July 2013. Banks ultimately became an independent artist and started her own independent record label, Chaos & Glory Recordings. Currently, Banks is signed to Parlophone and Warner Records. Banks has professionally released two mixtapes (Fantasea in 2012, and Slay-Z in 2016), one studio album (Broke with Expensive Taste in 2014), and two extended plays (1991 in 2012 and Icy Colors Change in 2018). In December 2017, Banks had her film debut in the musical drama Love Beats Rhymes, portraying the lead character. Her works have garnered acclaim from critics, drawing on various sounds including dutch house, rap, pop, electronic music and avant-garde. \"212\" has often been considered as one of the best songs of the century by various music publications, including Rolling Stone and Pitchfork. Throughout her career, Banks's social media presence and outspoken views, especially on U.S. politics and race, have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny. She has developed a reputation for having disputes with public figures on Twitter before being banned from the platform." ;

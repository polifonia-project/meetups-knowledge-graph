        mtp:hasAbstract        "Colin Boyd, Baron Boyd of Duncansby, PC, KC (born 7 June 1953) is a Scottish judge who has been a Senator of the College of Justice since June 2012. He was Lord Advocate for Scotland from 24 February 2000 until his resignation on 4 October 2006. On 11 April 2006, Downing Street announced that Colin Boyd would take a seat as a crossbench life peer; however, he took the Labour whip after resigning as Lord Advocate. He was formally introduced in the House of Lords on 3 July 2006. On the day SNP leader Alex Salmond was elected First Minister of Scotland (16 May 2007), it was reported that Boyd was quitting the Scottish Bar to become a part-time consultant with public law solicitors, Dundas & Wilson. He told the Glasgow Herald, \"This is a first. I don't think a Lord Advocate has ever done thisâ€”left the Bar and become a solicitor.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sean Altman (born May 9, 1961) is an American musician and songwriter. He is a founder and former lead singer (tenor) of the a capella musical group Rockapella and a pioneer of the modern a cappella movement. He was a member of Rockapella from its inception in 1986 until he left the group in 1997 to launch a solo career. As a founding member of Rockapella, Altman is best remembered for his role on the PBS children's geography game show Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, as the band served as the house vocal band and comedy troupe. Altman and his childhood friend David Yazbek co-wrote the show's theme song, which is recognized as one of the best-known television themes in history. Rockapella released seven albums in Japan and two in the United States during Altman's eleven-year tenure. As a subsequent solo artist, Altman has released four solo albums on the independent Chow Fun Records: seanDEMOnium (1997), alt.mania (2002), Losing Streak (2005), and SALT (2018). In 2016 Altman and singer-songwriter Jack Skuller formed The Everly Set, an acclaimed tribute to The Everly Brothers, and in 2020 the duo formed the tribute act Forever Simon & Garfunkel. Both acts tour nationally and have released CD compilation albums. Altman's comedy song act Sean Altman's JEWMONGOUS has released two solo comedy song albums — Taller Than Jesus and The Least Jewy Jew In Jewville — about which The Washington Post wrote \"Witty and outrageously lampooning ... full of catchy melodies, clever arrangements and lyrics that yield satiric gems.\" His a cappella group The GrooveBarbers has released three albums: Glory (2005), Guts (2010), and Warning: Barbershop (2014), and his defunct comedy song duo What I Like About Jew released the album Unorthodox (2005) before its breakup in 2006. In 2017 Altman and singer-songwriter Patti Rothberg released an album of their original songs entitled \"Dragon Meets Phoenix\". Altman wrote and recorded \"Save The Ocean\" and \"You Ought To Be Saving Water\" (with ex-Rockapella members Barry Carl and Elliott Kerman) for the popular Schoolhouse Rock! series, and has composed songs for the TV shows \"Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?\" (PBS), \"Where In Time Is Carmen Sandiego?\" (PBS), \"Out Of The Box\" (DISNEY), \"The Book Of Pooh\" (DISNEY), \"The Damn Show\", \"Brickleberry\", Science Mission 101, and the feature film \"Teddy P. Brains\"." ;

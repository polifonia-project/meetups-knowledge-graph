        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Charles Klink (born February 3, 1962) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1987 to 1996 for the Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, Florida Marlins, and Seattle Mariners. Klink once went 90 consecutive games without allowing a home run, the longest by a left-handed pitcher since at least 1957 and possibly the longest such streak of all time. Klink attended St. Thomas University, and in 1982 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the New York Mets in the 36th round of the 1983 MLB Draft." ;

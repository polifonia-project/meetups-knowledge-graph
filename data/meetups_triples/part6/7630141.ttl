She began her career as an actress in Richard Cottrell's Cambridge Theatre Company from 1971 through 1975 which was the resident repertory theatre company of both the Bristol Old Vic and the Cambridge Arts Theatre. In 1974 she made her screen debut as Sally Potter in the musical film Stardust. She rose to fame for her portrayal of the drug addicted rock star Anna Wynd in the BAFTA award winning television drama Rock Follies (1976) in which she was part of a musical trio which also included Julie Covington as Dee and Rula Lenska as Q. The music the three women recorded for this television drama was released as a soundtrack album which reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart. Afterwards Cornwell remained active as an actress in both British and American film, television, and the theatre up until her retirement in 2016. She was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1977-1980 and again in 2013." ;

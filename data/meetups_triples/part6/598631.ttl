He is the current weather anchor on NBC's Today, and occasionally co-hosts 3rd Hour Today. He has an inactive American Meteorological Society Television Seal #238.

On November 14, 2014, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, Roker set the Guinness World Record by reporting for 34 hours. On the December 14, 2018 episode of Today, Roker was honored for 40 years at NBC. The Today Plaza was officially named the \"Rokerfeller Plaza\" in his honor." ;

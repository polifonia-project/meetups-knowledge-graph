        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Drakoulias (born 1965) is a Greek-American music producer and a former A&R executive at the American Recordings label. He is often considered a protégé of Rick Rubin. Drakoulias grew up in Syosset, New York, and attended Syosset High School, where he started his musical career with a band called Lifeline. He went to college at New York University (NYU), where he majored in music and business. There he befriended Rick Rubin, whom he met after he started dating an ex-girlfriend of Rubin's. He became one of the first hires for Rubin's Def Jam label. As an A&R man, he discovered L.L. Cool J and the Beastie Boys. After Rubin left Def Jam to move to Los Angeles and form the Def American label, which was later retitled American Recordings, Drakoulias moved with him and became a producer. Drakoulias signed The Black Crowes, The Jayhawks and The Freewheelers to American Recordings, and produced albums for all three. He has also produced albums for artists including Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Maria McKee, Primal Scream, Madrugada, Screaming Trees and Unida. He has also produced tracks for Kula Shaker and served as a music supervisor for a number of movies, including Blades of Glory, School of Rock, Star Trek, Team America: World Police, Tropic Thunder, The Runaways, Zodiac, The Hangover, The Hangover Part II and Super 8. Drakoulias also plays bass guitar on the Glenn Danzig & the Power and Fury Orchestra song \"Less Than Zero\"." ;

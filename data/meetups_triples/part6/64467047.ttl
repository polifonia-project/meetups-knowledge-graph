        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roberto Jose Dela Cruz Nievera (/njɛˈvɛərə/; October 17, 1936 – March 27, 2018) was a Filipino-American singer and businessman. He rose to prominence in 1959 after winning the \"Search for Johnny Mathis of the Philippines\", a singing contest on the television variety show Student Canteen. He was one of the original members of the Society of Seven (SOS). Born in Baguio, Nievera grew up participating in many amateur singing contests. He studied at the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he was trained by National Artist for Theater Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero. He found moderate success in clubs singing as the \"Johnny Mathis of the Philippines\" after Student Canteen. Nievera then joined the Hawaii-based musical group the Fabulous Echoes in 1966, which later became the Society of Seven. In 1976, following a decade-long stint with the SOS, Nievera released his self-titled debut album in Hollywood. He recorded three more albums released from 1978 to 1996. Nievera came back to the Philippines in 1989 and mounted a series of concerts called Timeless through the 1990s and the early 2000s, which earned him another moniker as the \"Timeless Balladeer\". He also endeavored into business by opening various restaurant franchises in the country. After it failed, Nievera returned to the United States in 2003, where he settled until his death in 2018 at the age of 81. He was the father of Martin Nievera, whom he inspired and mentored." ;

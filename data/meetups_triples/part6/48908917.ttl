        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jaki Whitren (1954 â€“ November 24, 2016) was a British singer-songwriter. Her debut album, Raw But Tender (1973), featuring the single \"Give Her The Day\" which received some airplay on BBC Radio 1, was recorded when she was 19 years old. It was a mix of blues, folk and rock, and she also played guitar and banjo. She played a tour, supporting John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra. She also contributed to the Alan Parsons Project's release in 1977, I Robot. In later years, she devoted herself to her personal and musical relationship with husband and fellow musician John Cartwright, in a more avant-garde jazz direction. Her only other album was the self-released Isis Unveiled. She died of cancer shortly after his death from a heart attack." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yulia Olegovna Volkova (Russian: Юлия Олеговна Волкова; born 20 February 1985), better known by the alternative spelling of Julia, is a Russian singer best known for being a member of the Russian girl group t.A.T.u., along with Lena Katina. Formed in Moscow, Russia by Ivan Shapovalov in March 1999, the group signed a record deal with Universal Music Russia, and eventually Universal's sub-label Interscope Records in 2001. The group's first single, \"All the Things She Said\", topped the charts in countries including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom, but also generated controversy due to the girls kissing onscreen. The group recorded three studio albums in English, including their bestselling 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane, three Russian albums, and four compilation albums. They also worked on other projects, including the 2011 film You and I, and opened T.A. Music, a Russia-based record label. In March 2011, t.A.T.u.'s management issued a press release officially stating that the duo had split. Volkova signed a solo contract with Gala Records in June 2011, and released her debut single, \"All Because of You\", in November 2011. The song was also released in a Russian-language version under the title \"Сдвину мир\" (I'll Change the World). Her worldwide debut single, titled \"Didn't Wanna Do It\", was released on 21 August 2012." ;

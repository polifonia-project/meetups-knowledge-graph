        mtp:hasAbstract        "Megan Alexanda Washington (born 7 January 1986) is an Australian musician and songwriter who works mononymously as Washington. Originally performing jazz music, her style shifted to indie pop and alternative rock. She has released three studio albums, I Believe You Liar (July 2010), There There (September 2014) and Batflowers (August 2020). Both I Believe You Liar and There There reached the top 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart and Batflowers both reached top 25 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Her music has been described by I-D as \"sexy synth-laden pop\" and in 2019 the Sydney Morning Herald said of her intimate tour run, that \"Washington’s impressive command of her relatively small stage gave proof her music can work anywhere, anyway, any time.\" She has won three ARIA Music Awards with two in 2010 for I Believe You Liar, Best Female Artist and Breakthrough Artist – Release. The other win was Best Cover Art for Batflowers in 2020." ;

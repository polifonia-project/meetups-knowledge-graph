        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cadel Lee Evans AM (/kəˈdɛl/; born 14 February 1977) is an Australian former professional racing cyclist, who competed professionally in both mountain biking and road bicycle racing. A four-time Olympian, Evans is one of three non-Europeans – along with Greg LeMond and Egan Bernal – to have officially won the Tour de France, winning the race in 2011. Early in his career, he was a champion mountain biker, winning the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in 1998 and 1999 and placing seventh in the men's cross-country mountain bike race at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Evans is a four-time Olympian. Evans turned to full-time road cycling in 2001, and gradually progressed through the ranks. He finished second in the Tour de France in 2007 and 2008. Both of these 2nd place finishes are in the top 10 of the closest Tours in history. He became the first Australian to win the UCI ProTour (2007) and the UCI Road World Championships in 2009. After finishing outside the top twenty in 2009 and 2010, Evans became the first Australian rider to win the Tour de France in 2011, riding for the BMC Racing Team. He took the race lead on the penultimate day, after completing a 42.5-kilometre (26.4-mile) individual time trial some two-and-a-half minutes quicker than his closest rivals, Andy Schleck and Fränk Schleck. At age 34, he was among the five oldest winners in the race's history. He also made the podium in the 2009 Vuelta a España and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. Evans retired on 1 February 2015, after completing a race named in his honour." ;

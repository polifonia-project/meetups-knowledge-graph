She was a pioneer missionary and educator there for 12 years (from 1852–1860 and 1866–1870). In 1858, she married Taylor and was an invaluable assistant and influence to him. In her time with the CIM, she was instrumental in training single women to be missionaries in China, when opportunities for women to serve had been previously dependent on having a missionary husband." ;

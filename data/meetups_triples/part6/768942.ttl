        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frederick Richard Dimbleby, CBE (25 May 1913 â€“ 22 December 1965) was an English journalist and broadcaster, who became the BBC's first war correspondent, and then its leading TV news commentator. As host of the long-running current affairs programme Panorama, he pioneered a popular style of interviewing that was respectful but searching. At formal public events, he could combine gravitas with creative insights based on extensive research. He was also able to maintain interest throughout the all-night election specials. The annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture was founded in his memory." ;

In 1632 he transferred his lands into a trust intended for \"pious uses\", from which charitable action and in order to distinguish him from his many prominent relations, he became known to posterity as \"Pious Uses Hele\", which his biographer Prince looked upon \"as a more honourable appellation than the greatest empty title\". The trustees included his wife, together with John Hele and a number of friends. The trust was used to create a number of schools in Devon including Plympton Grammar School (founded 1658, built 1664) (alias Hele's School)." ;

His first successes came through Song Fight!, an online songwriting and recording competition, where he became known for consistently beating opponents. Throughout his history at Song Fight!, he has never lost a competition as MC Frontalot, although he has entered only seven entries in that name. In one such song fight, entitled \"Romantic Cheapskate\", he likens Song Fight! to a neglected lover who favors him regardless of how he treats her.

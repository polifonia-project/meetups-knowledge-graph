        mtp:hasAbstract        "Theobald Theodor Friedrich Alfred von Bethmann Hollweg (29 November 1856 â€“ 1 January 1921) was a German politician who was the chancellor of the German Empire from 1909 to 1917. He oversaw the German entry into World War I. According to biographer Konrad H. Jarausch, a primary concern for Bethmann in July 1914 was the steady growth of Russian power, and the growing closeness of the British and French military collaboration. Under these circumstances he decided to run what he considered a calculated risk to back Austria-Hungary in a local war against Serbia, while risking a major war with Russia. He calculated that France would not support Russia. It failed when Russia decided on general mobilization, and his own army demanded the opportunity to use the Schlieffen Plan for quick victory against a poorly prepared France. By rushing through Belgium, Germany expanded the war to include the United Kingdom. Bethmann thus failed to keep France and Britain out of the conflict, which became the First World War. He remained in office throughout most of the war, until July 1917, when he relinquished the post in response to pressure from Erich von Ludendorff and was succeeded by Georg Michaelis." ;

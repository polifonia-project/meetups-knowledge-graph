        mtp:hasAbstract        "Albert Dean Rosellini (January 21, 1910 â€“ October 10, 2011) was an American politician who served as the 15th governor of Washington from 1957 to 1965 and was both the first Italian-American and Roman Catholic governor elected west of the Mississippi River. During a political career that spanned 40 years, Rosellini was an activist leader who worked to reform the state's prisons and mental health facilities, expand the state highway system, create the University of Washington's medical and dental schools, and build the second floating bridge across Lake Washington. Rosellini holds the record as the longest-lived U.S. state governor in American history, having reached the age of 101 years, 262 days." ;

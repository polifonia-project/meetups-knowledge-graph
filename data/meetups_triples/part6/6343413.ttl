        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jamal Robertson (born January 10, 1977) is a former American and Canadian football running back and kick returner. He played college football at Ohio Northern and played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) and Canadian Football League (CFL) from 2001 to 2011. Originally from Dayton, Ohio, Robertson was a two-time Division III All-American at Ohio Northern. An undrafted free agent in 2001, he began his professional football career on the practice squad of the CFL team Calgary Stampeders. Robertson then played for five seasons in the NFL, primarily as a kick returner. He signed with the NFL's San Francisco 49ers in early 2002 and played for the NFL Europe team Rhein Fire prior to debuting with the 49ers later that year. From 2004 to 2005, Robertson played for the Carolina Panthers, where he helped the 2005 team advance to the NFC Championship. After playing briefly for the Atlanta Falcons very late in the 2006 season, Robertson returned to the CFL for his later football career. He played for the Toronto Argonauts from 2008 to 2009 and BC Lions from 2010 to 2011. In his final pro football season, Robertson was part of the 2011 BC Lions team that won the 99th Grey Cup." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lauren Ashley Daigle (/ˈdeɪ.ɡəl/) (born September 9, 1991) is an American contemporary Christian music singer and songwriter. After being signed to the label Centricity Music, she released her debut album, How Can It Be, in 2015. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart, has been certified Platinum by the RIAA and produced three No. 1 singles on the Billboard Christian Airplay chart (\"First\", \"Trust in You\", and \"O'Lord\"). Daigle's third studio album, Look Up Child, was released in September 2018. Bolstered by the pop crossover success of the single \"You Say\", it went on to debut at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the highest-charting Christian album by a woman in over 20 years, and No. 1 on the Top Christian Albums chart, with 115,000 album-equivalent units sold in the first week. The album's lead single, \"You Say\", peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and has broken the record for the number of weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart at 129 weeks for any solo artist. The album and single earned Daigle two Grammy Awards. In addition to two Grammy Awards, Daigle has won seven GMA Dove Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and has had four No. 1 singles on both the Billboard Christian Airplay and Hot Christian Songs chart." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brent Colin Sutter (born June 10, 1962) is a Canadian former National Hockey League (NHL) player and former head coach of the New Jersey Devils and Calgary Flames. Selected by the New York Islanders 17th overall at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft, Sutter played over 1,000 games for the Islanders and Chicago Blackhawks during his 18-year career. Regarded as one of the best face-off specialists of his generation, Sutter won the Stanley Cup twice with the Islanders and was an All-Star. He represented Canada on numerous occasions, winning the Canada Cup three times. After retiring as a player in 1998, Sutter bought the Red Deer Rebels of the Western Hockey League and served as the team's head coach and general manager for eight seasons, winning the Memorial Cup in 2001. He coached the Canadian junior team to gold medals at the 2005 and 2006 World Junior Hockey Championships, as well as winning the 2007 Super Series. Sutter compiled a 19–0–1 record in three years as the national junior team coach. He joined the New Jersey Devils as their head coach in 2007. He led the Devils to one division title in two seasons before leaving New Jersey to take on the same position in Calgary, working for brother Darryl, who was at the time, the Flames' general manager. He is a member of the famous Sutter family. He was one of six brothers, along with Brian, Darryl, Duane, Ron, and Rich, to play in the NHL. He coached his son Brandon and nephew Brett while with Red Deer; both have also gone on to play in the NHL. His daughter Brooke played volleyball for Red Deer College and was a first team conference all star in 2013." ;

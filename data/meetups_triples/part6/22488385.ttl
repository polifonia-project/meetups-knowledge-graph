        mtp:hasAbstract        "Amber Rose Levonchuck (born October 21, 1983) is an American model and television personality. She first gained attention after she appeared in the music video for Young Jeezy and Kanye West's single \"Put On\". In 2008, Rose began a high-profile two-year romantic relationship with West that led her to star in his Louis Vuitton ads. She then signed a modeling contract with Ford Models in 2009. She would attain further prominence after she appeared as a video vixen in numerous hip hop music videos. After splitting from West in 2010, Rose began dating Rapper Wiz Khalifa, whom she married in 2013. Rose filed for divorce in 2014. Following this, she released her first book, How to Be a Bad Bitch, published by Simon & Schuster. In 2015, she founded the Los Angeles chapter of the SlutWalk protest march, an annual feminist demonstration founded in Toronto. Rose then hosted her own talk show, entitled The Amber Rose Show, on VH1, which debuted in 2016. That same year, she also began hosting the syndicated radio call-in program Loveline." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Duane Jarvis (August 22, 1957 â€“ April 1, 2009) was an American guitarist and singer-songwriter who recorded songs with many rock and roll and country music performers, including Frank Black, Peter Case, Rosie Flores, John Prine, Amy Rigby, Lucinda Williams, Dwight Yoakam, Gene Clark & Carla Olson. In addition to his collaborations, which included co-writing \"Still I Long For Your Kiss\", a song on Williams's Grammy-winning album Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, he also released a number of solo albums. He described his style as \"country rock by way of the British Invasion\" in a 1994 interview with The Oregonian, citing The Who, The Kinks, and The Rolling Stones as influences who themselves had borrowed much from roots music." ;

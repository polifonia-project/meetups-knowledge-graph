Nicknamed Harry, Maestro, and Ingl√©s, Hayes, with 221 official goals (including AFA and Liga Rosarina competitions) is the all-time leading top scorer in the history of Rosario Central. Moreover, Hayes is the most winning player with 20 official titles won (5 AFA championships, and 15 titles in Rosario regional leagues). His brother Ennis was another notable player for Rosario Central in the 1910s and 1920s." ;

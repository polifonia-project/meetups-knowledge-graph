        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robin Reed (October 20, 1899 â€“ December 20, 1978) was an American amateur and professional wrestler, and wrestling coach. Throughout his amateur career he never lost a wrestling match, official or unofficial, to anyone at any weight class. Reed won a gold medal in freestyle wrestling at the 1924 Summer Olympics. He led Oregon State to its first team national championship, and as a wrestler in college he consistently wrestled in the 170 pound weight division, despite his actual weight being close to 140 pounds. Reed later wrestled professionally, and was a World Welterweight Champion." ;

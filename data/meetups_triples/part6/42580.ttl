        mtp:hasAbstract        "Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri (Spanish pronunciation: [leoˈpoldo foɾtuˈnato ɣalˈtjeɾi kasˈteli]; 15 July 1926 – 12 January 2003) was an Argentine general and politician of Italian descent who served as President of Argentina from December 1981 to June 1982. Galtieri ruled as a military dictator during the National Reorganization Process as leader of the Third Junta with Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo. Galtieri was chief combat engineer of the Argentine Army and a supporter of the 1976 military coup d'état which helped him become commander-in-chief of the army in 1980. Galtieri overthrew Roberto Viola and was appointed President, establishing Argentina as a strong ally of the United States, introducing fiscally conservative economic reforms, and increasing support to Contras in Nicaragua. Galtieri and his regime continued the Dirty War with the 601 Intelligence Battalion death squad reporting directly to him. Galtieri's declining popularity due to his civil rights abuses and the worsening economic crisis in Argentina caused him to invade the Falkland Islands in April 1982. Galtieri was removed from power after Argentine defeat in the Falklands War in June, which led to the restoration of democracy and his prosecution for military misconduct in 1986. Galtieri was pardoned by Carlos Menem in 1989 and lived in obscurity until his arrest for new charges shortly before his death in 2003." ;

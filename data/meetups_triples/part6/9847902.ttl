        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chauncey Simpson (December 21, 1901 – April 20, 1970) was the interim head football coach at Missouri from 1943 to 1945 while Don Faurot, the standing head coach, served in the Navy during World War II. He compiled a 12–14–2 record including a 40–27 loss to Texas in the 1946 Cotton Bowl Classic. During that time, he also served as the school's track coach. He himself, was a football player at Missouri. With Faurot's return in 1946 Simpson reverted to his pre-war position as an assistant football coach. He was also the institution's long-time golf coach before retiring in the 1960s. He was the younger brother of hurdler and track coach Robert Simpson." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Emmanuel Lynn Gales (December 4, 1964 â€“ July 19, 2002), known professionally as Little Jimmy King, was an American Memphis blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. A left-handed guitarist who played the instrument upside down, he concocted his stage name in deference to his two musical heroes, Jimi Hendrix and Albert King. He is best known for his tracks \"Win, Lose or Draw\" and \"Upside Down and Backwards\". He was the frontman of Little Jimmy King & the Memphis Soul Survivors. He also worked with Albert King and with his brothers Eric and Eugene Gales." ;

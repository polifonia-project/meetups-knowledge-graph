        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chevalier William Henry Grattan Flood (baptised 1 November 1857 â€“ 6 August 1928) was a noted Irish author, composer, musicologist, and historian. As a writer and ecclesiastical composer, his personal contributions to Irish music produced enduring works, although he is regarded today as controversial due to the inaccuracy of some of his work. As a historian, his output was prolific on topics of local and national historical or biographical interest. In 1917, Flood was awarded the papal cross Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice by Pope Benedict XV and in 1922 was elevated by Pope Leo XIII to the Order of St Gregory with the title Chevalier, thereafter he was often called \"Chevalier Flood\". He is not to be confused with the unrelated Irish statesmen Henry Flood or Henry Grattan." ;

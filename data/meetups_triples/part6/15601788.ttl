Having started in July, 2010, Kennedy was asked to resign in October 2016. Kennedy's resignation raised serious questions about Buck Leadership. Kennedy has published over 80 manuscripts in prestigious journals including Cell, Nature, Science, Genes & Development, and PNAS. Potential public health benefits claimed in one study were questioned by the UK National Health Service in 2014. Kennedy has served on the NIH Cellular Mechanisms of Aging and Development study section since 2006, acting as Committee Chair since 2010. He has also served on the grant review committee for American Federation for Aging Research Grants since 2006.

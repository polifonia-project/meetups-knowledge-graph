        mtp:hasAbstract        "Beryl Davis (16 March 1924 â€“ 28 October 2011) was a vocalist who sang with British and American big bands, as well as being an occasional featured vocalist at a very young age with the Quintette du Hot Club de France between 1936 and 1939. She was still performing (in her 80s) into the 2000s, possibly the last surviving and performing singer of the generation of popular entertainers from the 1930s and wartime years. Her younger sister is Lisa Davis Waltz, a teen actress in the 1950s and 1960s and later, the voice of Anita in Disney's 101 Dalmatians." ;

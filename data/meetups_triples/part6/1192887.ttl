        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ron Rude (born 24 October 1956) is a rock and roll musician in Melbourne, Australia. He was one of the first Australian indie musicians to self record and release their own material, which he did with the release of his first album The Borders of Disgrace in 1979 and is considered to be a pioneer of DIY recording. Rude was also part of the post punk \"little band scene\" that flourished in Melbourne in the late 1970s to 1980s, and is probably best known (to the general public) for staging a hunger strike in the window of local record shop Missing Link, and the demand that local radio station 3XY play his records, threatening to drown himself in a bucket of water if they did not. From the years 2001 to 2003, the hunger strike was the subject of a play called 3XY Or I Die. Since 2001, Rude has been performing new material with a new band called the Ron Rude Renaissance." ;

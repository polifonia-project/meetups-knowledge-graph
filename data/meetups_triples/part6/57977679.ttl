As an editor at Opera News from 1988 to 2016, he commissioned hundreds of articles from a range of writers, seeking out well-known voices and cultivating young talent.

He was the author of five biographies: Can't Help Singing: The Life of Eileen Farrell, published in 2000, The Bennetts: An Acting Family, Ethel Merman: A Life, Pauline Kael: A Life in the Dark, and Can I Go Now?

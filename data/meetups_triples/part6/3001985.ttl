        mtp:hasAbstract        "Pamela Sydney Frankau (3 January 1908 â€“ 8 June 1967) was a popular English novelist from a prominent artistic and literary family. Abandoned by her novelist father Gilbert Frankau at an early age, she soon became a prolific writer herself. She stopped writing for a decade after the death of her lover, the poet Humbert Wolfe, in 1940. After serving in World War II, she was married for several years to an American naval officer, but returned to England and resumed her writing career." ;

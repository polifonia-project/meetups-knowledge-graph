Debuting as a soloist in 1999, Shiina released four albums with major label Sony Music Japan between 2001 and 2004, later signing a contract with R and C to release his fourth album Cruisin' (2006). In 2008 Shiina formed the band Junpei Shiina & The Soul Force, who renamed themselves in 2010, releasing their debut album Dashi no Torikata through King Records in the same year. In 2014, Shiina formed the four member band Hitosarai with Tomotaka Imamichi. Shiina has often collaborated with his sister Ringo Sheena by singing duets together, most notably the theme song of the Mika Ninagawa directed film Sakuran (2007), \"Kono Yo no Kagiri\"." ;

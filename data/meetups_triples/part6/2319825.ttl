        mtp:hasAbstract        "Al Hoffman (September 25, 1902 â€“ July 21, 1960) was an American song composer. He was a hit songwriter active in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, usually co-writing with others and responsible for number-one hits through each decade, many of which are still sung and recorded today. He was posthumously made a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984. The popularity of Hoffman's song, \"Mairzy Doats\", co-written with Jerry Livingston and Milton Drake, was such that newspapers and magazines wrote about the craze. Time magazine titled one article \"Our Mairzy Dotage\". The New York Times simply wrote the headline, \"That Song\". Hoffman's songs were recorded by singers such as Frank Sinatra (\"Close To You\", \"I'm Gonna Live Until I Die\"), Billy Eckstine (\"I Apologize\") Perry Como (\"Papa Loves Mambo\", \"Hot Diggity\"), Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong (\"Who Walks In When I Walk Out\"), Nat \"King\" Cole, Tony Bennett, the Merry Macs, Sophie Tucker, Eartha Kitt, Patsy Cline, Patti Page (\"Allegheny Moon\") and Bette Midler. In October, 2007, Hoffman's \"I'm Gonna Live Til I Die\" was the lead single from Queen Latifah's album, Trav'lin' Light. Though Hoffman had apparently little connection to Chicago, he wrote the Chicago Bears fight song \"Bear Down, Chicago Bears\" in 1941 under the pseudonym Jerry Downs." ;

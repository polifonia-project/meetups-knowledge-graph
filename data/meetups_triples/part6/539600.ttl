        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Donald Imus Jr. (July 23, 1940 â€“ December 27, 2019), also known mononymously as Imus, was an American radio personality, television show host, recording artist, and author. His radio show, Imus in the Morning, was aired on various stations and digital platforms nationwide until 2018. In 1968, he began his first radio job, at KUTY in Palmdale, California. Three years later, he landed the morning broadcast position at WNBC in New York City. Imus was fired from WNBC in 1977, and following a one-year stint at WHK in Cleveland was rehired by WNBC in 1979. Imus remained at the station until it left the air in 1988, at which time his show moved to WFAN, which took over WNBC's former frequency of 660 kHz. Following Howard Stern's success with national syndication, Imus in the Morning adopted the same model in 1993. Throughout his later career, Imus was labeled a \"shock jock\". He was fired by CBS Radio in April 2007 after describing the Rutgers University women's basketball team as \"nappy-headed hos\". In January 2018, Cumulus Media, in bankruptcy reorganization, told Imus the company was going to stop paying him. His final show aired on March 29, 2018. He died the following year of complications from lung disease." ;

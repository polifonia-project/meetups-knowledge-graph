        mtp:hasAbstract        "Henry Fothergill Chorley (15 December 1808 â€“ 16 February 1872) was an English literary, art and music critic, writer and editor. He was also an author of novels, drama, poetry and lyrics. Chorley was a prolific and important music and literary critic and music gossip columnist of the mid-nineteenth century and wrote extensively about music in London and in Europe. His opera libretti and works of fiction were far less successful. He is perhaps best remembered today for his lyrics to \"The Long Day Closes\", a part song set by Arthur Sullivan in 1868." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lex Humphries (August 22, 1936 â€“ July 11, 1994) was an American jazz drummer. He worked with two musicians known for mixing world music with jazz: Sun Ra and Yusef Lateef. As a member of Sun Ra's \"Arkestra\" he appeared in the film Space Is the Place. Humphries played on the Giant Steps sessions with John Coltrane. The renditions he and Cedar Walton recorded with Coltrane were released as alternative tracks in 1974. He was also the first drummer in the Jazztet, appearing on their first album, Meet the Jazztet, in 1960. He died in Philadelphia in 1994, aged 57. The cause of death was undisclosed, but according to fellow drummer Mickey Roker, he was distraught in his later years due to marital problems and being separated from his son." ;

He is best known for his films, which feature his erratic, loose and transgressive aesthetic, exploring taboo themes and incorporating experimental techniques, as well as his various endeavors into art, music, fashion and advertising. He has been acclaimed for his films Gummo (1997) and Julien Donkey-Boy (1999) which explore unconventional narratives and themes of dysfunctional families, as well as Mister Lonely (2007), Spring Breakers (2012) and The Beach Bum (2019)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marcelino Guerra (26 April 1914 – 30 June 1996), nicknamed \"Rapindey\", was a Cuban singer, songwriter and guitarist. He spent much of his life in the United States and retired in Spain. As a vocalist, his primary role was segunda voz (harmony singer). He is best remembered for his compositions, which included many guarachas (\"Pare cochero\", \"Me voy pa'l pueblo\"), boleros (\"Convergencia\", \"A mi manera\") and songs that straddle both genres (\"Sandunguera\"). He collaborated with lyricists Julio Blanco Leonard and Bienvenido Julián Gutiérrez, as well as his wife, Mercedes Valdés (not to be confused with Merceditas). He made his last recordings in Spain for the record label Nubenegra in the 1990s." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kendrick Melvin Nunn (born August 3, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Illinois Fighting Illini and the Oakland Golden Grizzlies. Nunn played three seasons at the University of Illinois, where he was named to the 2013–14 Big Ten All-Freshman team. He was dismissed from the Illini after the 2015–16 season, and had to sit out a season after transferring to Oakland University due to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) transfer rules. He won the 2018 Horizon League Men's Basketball Player of the Year award at Oakland after leading the nation in three-point shots made per game. After going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, Nunn spent the 2018–19 season with the Santa Cruz Warriors of the NBA G League. In April 2019, he signed with the Miami Heat and reached the 2020 NBA Finals. He was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. In August 2021, Nunn signed with the Lakers. However, he missed the entire 2021–22 season with a knee injury." ;

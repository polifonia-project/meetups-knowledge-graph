        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gabrielle Mary Antonia Hoffmann (born January 8, 1982) is an American actress. She initially found success as a child actress, appearing in Field of Dreams, Uncle Buck, and Sleepless in Seattle, and then later as a teenager with Now and Then, Volcano, All I Wanna Do, and 200 Cigarettes. After a hiatus, Hoffmann returned to film acting in 2007, appearing in various independent projects that garnered critical acclaim. This has been described as a career \"resurgence\", due to her roles in Crystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus with Michael Cera, Wild with Reese Witherspoon, and her leading role in C'mon C'mon alongside Joaquin Phoenix. On television, she starred as Ali Pfefferman in Transparent (2014–2019), and appeared as Caroline Sackler in Girls (2014–2017), which garnered her three Primetime Emmy Award nominations." ;

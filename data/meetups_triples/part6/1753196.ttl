        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Stone III (born 1966) is an American film director. He is best known for Drumline starring Nick Cannon, Mr. 3000 starring Bernie Mac, and Paid in Full. Stone directed the video to \"What They Do\" by The Roots, featuring the group running through many rap video clich√©s. Stone is the creator of the popular advertising campaign \"Whassup?\" for Budweiser in 1999. In October 2008, he directed a spoof of this campaign to depict his critical view of the Republican Party's eight years in the White House and to support the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. A 1984 graduate of Central High School in Philadelphia, he is the son of Louise Davis Stone and journalist and Tuskegee Airman Chuck Stone." ;

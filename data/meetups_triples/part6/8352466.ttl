        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Dewitt \"Homer\" Bailey Jr. (born May 3, 1986) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds from 2007 through 2018, the Kansas City Royals and Oakland Athletics in 2019, and the Minnesota Twins in 2020. The Reds selected Bailey in the first round (seventh overall) of the 2004 MLB draft. Prior to the 2007 season, both Baseball America and Baseball Prospectus named Bailey the top prospect in the Reds' farm system. Because of his success at the minor league level, Bailey's debut was highly anticipated when he was called up to the major league level in June 2007. He made his major league debut on June 8, 2007, against the Cleveland Indians. At the time of his debut, Bailey was the youngest player in the National League. Bailey has pitched two no-hitters in his career. On February 19, 2014, Bailey signed a six-year, $105 million contract with the Reds." ;

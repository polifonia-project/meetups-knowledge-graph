        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Gross FRSL (12 March 1935 â€“ 10 January 2011) was an eminent English man of letters. A leading intellectual, writer, anthologist, and critic, The Guardian (in a tribute titled \"My Hero\") and The Spectator were among several publications to describe Gross as \"the best-read man in Britain\". The Guardian's obituarist Ion Trewin wrote: \"Mr Gross is one good argument for the survival of the species\", a comment Gross would have disliked since he was known for his modesty. Charles Moore wrote in The Spectator: \"I am left with the irritated sense that he was under-appreciated. He was too clever, too witty, too modest for our age.\" Gross was the editor of The Times Literary Supplement from 1974 to 1981, senior book editor and book critic on the staff of The New York Times from 1983 to 1989, and theatre critic for The Sunday Telegraph from 1989 to 2005. He also worked as assistant editor on Encounter and as literary editor of The New Statesman and Spectator magazines." ;

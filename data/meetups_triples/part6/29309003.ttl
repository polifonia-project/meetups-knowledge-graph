        mtp:hasAbstract        "Josef Wagner the Younger (March 2, 1901 - February 10, 1957) was a Czech painter and sculptor. A pupil of Jan Štursa and Josef Mařatka, he studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts from 1922 to 1926. He was later a professor at the Art School in Prague. Here he met his future wife, , a sculptor, with whom he had two sons, who later became artists themselves. Warm stone colors best suited his own personal style, inspired by archaic Greece and the Czech Baroque style. There is a statue in his memory in Prague." ;

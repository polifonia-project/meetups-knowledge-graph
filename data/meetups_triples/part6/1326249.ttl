        mtp:hasAbstract        "Byung-hyun Kim (Korean: 김병현; Hanja: 金炳賢; Korean pronunciation: [kimbjʌŋçʌn] or [kim] [pjʌŋçʌn]; born January 19, 1979) is a South Korean former professional baseball pitcher. He had his most successful years with the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Boston Red Sox. Kim is remembered for his role in the 2001 World Series, in which he gave up consecutive ninth-inning leads in both Game 4 and Game 5, taking the loss in Game 4, though the Diamondbacks rebounded to win the Championship in 7 games over the New York Yankees. Kim went on to save 36 games for the Diamondbacks in 2002 and 16 for the Red Sox in 2003, and played in the 2002 All Star Game." ;

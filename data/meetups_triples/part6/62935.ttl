        mtp:hasAbstract        "Colonel Claus Philipp Maria Justinian Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (German: [ˈklaʊ̯s ˈʃɛŋk ˈɡʁaːf fɔn ˈʃtaʊ̯fn̩bɛʁk]; 15 November 1907 – 21 July 1944) was a German army officer best known for his failed attempt on 20 July 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler at the Wolf's Lair. Despite initial support for the Nazi Party's nationalist aspects, and a tentative opposition to democracy, Stauffenberg joined the covert resistance movement within the Wehrmacht as the war continued, opposing the criminal character of the dictatorship. Alongside Major General Henning von Tresckow and General Hans Oster, Stauffenberg was a central figure in the conspiracy against Hitler within the Wehrmacht. Shortly following the foiled Operation Valkyrie plot, he was executed by firing squad. As a military officer from a noble background, Stauffenberg took part in the Invasion of Poland, the 1941-42 Invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa and the Tunisian Campaign during the Second World War." ;

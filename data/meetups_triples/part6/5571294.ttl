        mtp:hasAbstract        "Abelardo Fernández Antuña (Spanish pronunciation: [aβeˈlaɾðo feɾˈnandeθ anˈtuɲa]; born 19 April 1970), known simply as Abelardo as a player, is a Spanish former footballer who played as a central defender, currently the manager of Sporting de Gijón. A player with good heading and marking ability, he was also known for a distinctive bald head, a style which he adopted from a relatively young age. During his career he was almost exclusively associated with Sporting de Gijón and Barcelona, having amassed La Liga totals of 385 matches and 24 goals over 14 seasons, and also managed the former club for three years. Having won more than 50 caps for Spain in one full decade, Abelardo represented the nation in two World Cups and as many European Championships." ;

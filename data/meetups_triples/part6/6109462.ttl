        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kevin Andrew Saucier (born August 9, 1956) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher from 1978 to 1982 for the Philadelphia Phillies and Detroit Tigers. Nicknamed \"Hot Sauce\", Saucier (whose name is pronounced \"So-Shay\"), was an energetic pitcher who would often display his emotions while on the mound. Saucier retired prior to the 1983 season due to his loss of control on the mound leading him to fear that he might kill someone with a pitch." ;

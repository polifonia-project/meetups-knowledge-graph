Mills was born in Trefeglwys, Powys. He has a place in the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame, as the first Welshman to win the Wales Rally. His first rally was in 1983, and his WRC debut in 1994. He joined Solberg in Ford in 1999, later moving with him to the Subaru World Rally Team. Mills lives with his partner Helen and their children in Powys. On 11 June 2010, Mills announced his immediate retirement from co-driving to concentrate on his motorsport preparation business. The 1–2 November, Mills returned to the WRC with Petter Solberg in the 2014 Rallye du Condroz with a Citroën C4 WRC. Mills later served as a co-driver for Elfyn Evans in the 2018 Tour de Corse, filling in for Daniel Barritt who suffered a concussion during the 2018 Rally Mexico. Mills also lent his voice as a co-driver in the 2019 racing video game Dirt Rally 2.0, and reunited with Solberg in the latter's final career rally, 2019 Wales Rally GB with a Volkswagen Polo GTI R5." ;

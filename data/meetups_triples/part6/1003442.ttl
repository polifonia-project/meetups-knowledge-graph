        mtp:hasAbstract        "Milton Robert Carr, commonly known as Bob Carr, (born March 27, 1943) is an American lawyer, academic, and politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. Carr served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan's 6th and 8th congressional districts for eight terms and one term, respectively. Carr's career in the U.S. House had a two-year hiatus in which he had lost his seat to Jim Dunn in 1980 before being reelected to Congress in 1982. Following his career in Congress, Carr became of counsel at a Washington, D.C.-based communications law firm in 2005. He is involved with the United States Association of Former Members of Congress, where he serves on the board of directors." ;

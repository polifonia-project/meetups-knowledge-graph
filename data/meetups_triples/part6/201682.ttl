        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Gilbert (born John Cecil Pringle; July 10, 1897 â€“ January 9, 1936) was an American actor, screenwriter and director. He rose to fame during the silent film era and became a popular leading man known as \"The Great Lover\". His breakthrough came in 1925 with his starring roles in The Merry Widow and The Big Parade. At the height of his career, Gilbert rivaled Rudolph Valentino as a box office draw. Gilbert's career declined precipitously when silent pictures gave way to talkies. Though Gilbert was often cited as one of the high-profile examples of an actor who was unsuccessful in making the transition to sound films, his decline as a star had far more to do with studio politics and money than with the sound of his screen voice, which was rich and distinctive." ;

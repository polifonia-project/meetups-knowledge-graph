        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Moule (14 January 1784 â€“ January 1851) was an English antiquarian, writer on heraldry, and one of Victorian England's most influential map-makers. He is best known for his popular and highly decorated county maps of England, steel-engraved and first published separately between 1830 and 1832. Moule was born in Marylebone, London. He sold books in Duke Street, Grosvenor Square, from 1816 to 1822. Later, he became an inspector of 'blind' (illegibly addressed) letters at the General Post Office. He died at his residence in St. James's Palace, to which he was entitled as Chamber-keeper in the Lord Chamberlain's Department." ;

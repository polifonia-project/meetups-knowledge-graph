        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mohamed Al-Fayed (/ælfaɪˈɛd/; Egyptian Arabic: محمد الفايد [mæˈħæmmæd elˈfæːjed]; born 27 January 1929) is an Egyptian-born businessman whose residence and chief business interests have been in the United Kingdom since the late 1960s. His business interests include ownership of Hôtel Ritz Paris and formerly Harrods department store and Fulham F.C., both in London. In November 2022, Fayed's wealth was estimated at US$1.9 billion, ranking his wealth at no. 1,512 in the world. Fayed's son Dodi, from his first marriage to Samira Khashoggi from 1954 to 1956, was in a romantic relationship with Diana, Princess of Wales, when they both died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Fayed married Finnish socialite and former model Heini Wathén in 1985, with whom he also has four children: Jasmine, Karim, Camilla, and Omar." ;

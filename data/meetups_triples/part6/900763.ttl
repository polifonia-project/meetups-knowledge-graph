        mtp:hasAbstract        "May Fung Yee Pang (born October 24, 1950) is an American former music executive. She worked for John Lennon and Yoko Ono as a personal assistant and production coordinator, and when Lennon and Ono separated in 1973, Pang and Lennon began a relationship that lasted more than 18 months. Lennon later referred to this time as his \"Lost Weekend\". Pang subsequently produced two books about their relationshipâ€”a memoir called Loving John (Warner, 1983) and a book of photographs, Instamatic Karma (St. Martin's Press, 2008). Pang was married to producer Tony Visconti from 1989 to 2000 and has two children." ;

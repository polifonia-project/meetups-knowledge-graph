        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kisaki (妃, born March 10, 1976) is a Japanese musician who has worked with several visual kei bands, including La:Sadie's, Syndrome, Kisaki Project and Phantasmagoria. Besides playing bass and keyboards and composing music, he also works as a producer, previously for the Matina label and currently for Under Code Production. In 2008, when Phantasmagoria broke up, Kisaki once announced his retirement as a musician (although he would continue to participate in side projects, compose for other musicians, and produce the artists on his record label). However, in 2010, he announced that he was ending his retirement and debuted his new band, Lin -the End of Corruption World (凛 -the end of corruption world-)." ;

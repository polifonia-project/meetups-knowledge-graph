        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Alfred DeLeo (born March 27, 1950 in Winthrop, Massachusetts) is a former American politician from the state of Massachusetts. He served as Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 2009 to 2020, having succeeded Salvatore DiMasi, who resigned due to allegations of an ethics violation. DeLeo represented the Nineteenth Suffolk district, and before becoming House Speaker, was the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. The Nineteenth Suffolk district includes Winthrop and Revere. In addition to serving as a state representative, DeLeo served as a Winthrop town meeting member from 1977 to 2005 and was a member of the town's board of selectmen from 1978 to 1988. On December 16, 2020, it was reported that DeLeo would be stepping down as Speaker for a job at Northeastern University. He resigned both his house seat and speakership on December 29." ;

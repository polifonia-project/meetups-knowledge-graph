According to the Egyptian army spokesperson , the army besieged groups of terrorists and foiled attacks that targeted a number of other checkpoints in the Rafah area in North Sinai. The ambush got encircled by 13 armed vehicles carrying 100 Takfiris (terrorists who claim others are unbelievers). The outcome of the battle that lasted for hours was the killing of 46 takfiris and the destruction of six vehicles. Yet, 5 officers and 15 soldiers at the ambush were killed in action, including Colonel Mansi." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Diane B. Allen (born March 8, 1948) is an American politician and television journalist. A member of the Republican Party, she represented the 7th legislative district in the New Jersey Assembly from 1996 to 1998 and New Jersey Senate from 1998 to 2018. Allen was the senate majority whip from 1998 to 2001, deputy Republican conference leader from 2002 to 2003, and later deputy minority leader. In 2002, she was an unsuccessful candidate for United States Senate, finishing second in the Republican primary. Allen was the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor in 2021 after Jack Ciattarelli announced she had agreed to join his ticket. The pair lost the general election to the incumbent Democratic ticket of Phil Murphy and Sheila Oliver." ;

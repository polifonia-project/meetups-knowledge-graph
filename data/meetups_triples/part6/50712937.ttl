        mtp:hasAbstract        "Abū Muḥammad Maʿdīkarib ibn Qays ibn Maʿdīkarib (Arabic: الأشعث بن قيس), better known as al-Ashʿath (died ca. 661), was a chieftain of the Kinda tribe of Hadhramawt and founder of the one of the leading noble Arab households of Kufa, one of the two main garrison towns and administrative centers of Iraq under the Rashidun (632–661) and Umayyad (661–750) caliphs. He embraced Islam in the presence of the Islamic prophet Muhammad only to leave the faith following the latter's death in 632. He was subsequently imprisoned and pardoned by Caliph Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) after his repentance. He joined the Muslim conquests of Mesopotamia and Persia, fighting in several battles between 636 and 642. He settled in the newly-founded garrison city of Kufa and became the leader of his tribesmen there. He served as the governor of Adharbayjan under Caliph Uthman (r. 644–656) and as a commander in the Battle of Siffin in 657 under Caliph Ali (r. 656–661). He took part in the arbitration that ended the battle and died in Kufa. He was thereafter succeeded by his son Muhammad as leader of the Kufan Kindites." ;

In the late 1970s she moved to New York City to pursue a degree in theology at Lehmans College in the Bronx. Singing in the music clubs at night to support her college tuition, she met Big Nick Nicholas, who was a teacher of tenor saxophonist John Coltrane. She became a first-call jazz singer in Harlem and Greenwich Village. In 1997 she married jazz pianist Travis Shook and they started Dead Horse Records in Woodstock, New York." ;

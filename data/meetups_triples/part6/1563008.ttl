        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sebastian Kneipp (17 May 1821 – 17 June 1897) was a German Catholic priest and one of the forefathers of the naturopathic medicine movement. He is most commonly associated with the \"Kneipp Cure\" form of hydrotherapy (often called \"Kneipp therapy\" or \"Kneippism\"), the application of water through various methods, temperatures and pressures, which he claimed to have therapeutic or healing effects, thus building several hospitals in Bad Wörishofen. Although most commonly associated with one area of nature cure, Kneipp was the proponent of an entire system of healing, which rested on five main tenets: \n* Hydrotherapy – The use of water to treat ailments \n* Phytotherapy – The use of botanical medicines was another of Kneipp's specialties \n* Exercise – Promoting health of the body through movement \n* Nutrition – A wholesome diet of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables with limited meat. \n* Balance – Kneipp believed that a healthy mind begot a healthy person" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Roland Bohanon, Jr. (born August 7, 1937) is a jazz trombonist and session musician from Detroit, Michigan. In the early 1960s, he participated in Detroit's Workshop Jazz ensemble, with Johnny Griffith, Paula Greer, David Hamilton, Lefty Edwards and Herbie Williams. After appearing on several Motown recordings, together with leading musicians such as Hank Cosby, of the Funk Brothers, he went to live in California. In 1962, he replaced Garnett Brown in the Chico Hamilton Quintet. In 1963 and 1964, he recorded two albums for Motown's unsuccessful jazz Workshop label. In 1971, he was a member of the Ernie Wilkins Orchestra, playing alongside fellow trombonist Benny Powell, that backed Sarah Vaughan on her A Time in My Life album, recorded in Los Angeles. Between 1984 and 1993, he played in orchestras backing Frank Sinatra." ;

She is referred to as MediaCorp's \"Ah Jie\" (top actress) together with Zoe Tay for being one of the top actresses in Singapore's Chinese-language entertainment industry. At Singapore's Star Awards 1995, Fann became the first actress to snag three prominent awards in the same year: Best Actress, Best Newcomer and Top 5 Most Popular Female Artiste. After gaining regional exposure and popularity in Asia through film and television productions, she became the first Singaporean actress to break into Hollywood, playing Chon Lin in the 2003 film Shanghai Knights. She was also the youngest actress to have earned an All-Time Favourite Artiste at the Star Awards after winning the Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes award from 1995 to 2004 respectively with Xie Shaoguang. She married actor Christopher Lee on 29 September 2009." ;

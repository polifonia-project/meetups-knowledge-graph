        mtp:hasAbstract        "Meghan Linsey (born December 10, 1985) is an American singer-songwriter. A Ponchatoula, Louisiana native, Linsey started her musical career by forming Steel Magnolia with her boyfriend of three years, Joshua Scott Jones. Before trying out for Can You Duet, Linsey was a karaoke host at a Nashville karaoke bar, called Lonnie's Western Room, which is where she met Jones. After becoming the top winner on the show, the duo signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records, and released its debut single \"Keep On Lovin' You\" in August 2009, which was a Top 10 hit on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. In March 2014, Linsey and Jones split and decided to pursue solo careers." ;

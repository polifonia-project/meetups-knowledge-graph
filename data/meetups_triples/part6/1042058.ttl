Gibson, under the pen-name Maxwell Grant, wrote \"more than 300 novel-length\" Shadow stories, writing up to \"10,000 words a day\" to satisfy public demand during the character's golden age in the 1930s and 1940s. He authored several novels in the Biff Brewster juvenile series of the 1960s. He was married to Litzka R. Gibson, also a writer, and the couple lived in New York state." ;

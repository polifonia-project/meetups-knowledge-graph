        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jay Presson Allen (March 3, 1922 â€“ May 1, 2006) was an American screenwriter, playwright, stage director, television producer, and novelist. Known for her withering wit and sometimes-off-color wisecracks, she was one of the few women making a living as a screenwriter at a time when women were a rarity in the profession. \"You write to please yourself,\" she said, \"The only office where there's no superior is the office of the scribe.\"" ;

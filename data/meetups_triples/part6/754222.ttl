        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christopher Baldwin (born February 25, 1973) is an American illustrator and author of several webcomics, the most significant being Bruno, a look at the life of an introspective young woman set in the real world. Other works include shorter webcomic series, some being intentionally designed to attract syndication; these tend to be lighter in tone than Bruno, and include Shepard and May (published for 5 weeks in 2000), Kim in Love (published from October 1, 2001 until October 22, 2001), and Madge's Diary (published from November 5, 2001 until January 18, 2002). Little Dee, about a young girl adopted by a bear, was released on June 7, 2004 for syndication and completed in April 2010. Baldwin later published the science fiction webcomics Spacetrawler and One Way. Aside from comics, Baldwin also wrote the 2003 novel Loved into Submission: a Dark Existential Farce." ;

Constitutional scholar and academic Joaquin Bernas described Malcolm as \"the man who more than any single American contributed most to early constitutional development in the Philippines.\" At age 35, he was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, where he would serve for 19 years. His most enduring legacy perhaps lies in his role in the establishment of the College of Law at the University of the Philippines." ;

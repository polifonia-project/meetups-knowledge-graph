        mtp:hasAbstract        "Siranush Harutyunyan (Armenian: Սիրանուշ Հարությունյան; born 7 January 1987), known professionally as Sirusho (Armenian: Սիրուշո), is an Armenian singer and songwriter. She received her first award when she was nine years old for her song \"Lusabats\". Sirusho's first studio album, Sirusho, was released in 2000; followed by the second album Sheram in 2005. In the same year, she was awarded the Future of Armenian Music, Best Album and Best Female Performer awards in the first Armenian National Music Awards. Sirusho reached international recognition after representing Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 with her co-written song \"Qélé, Qélé\" in Belgrade, Serbia. The song finished fourth in the final and became a hit in Europe. The BBC described her as \"national treasure\" of Armenia during the contest. In 2012, Sirusho released the single \"PreGomesh\", which inspired her to launch a range of handcrafted silver jewelry of the same name, representing Armenian culture and craftsmanship mixed with modern fashion trends. Sirusho is the first Armenian artist to be twice-nominated at World Music Awards with \"PreGomesh\". In 2013, W magazine featured Sirusho in their list of \"6 un-American idols\", with the author saying \"the door is still open for Sirusho to introduce the world to a sound and language largely unknown in the West\". In 2017, Sirusho was awarded with the title of Honored Artist of Armenia upon the decree of President Serzh Sargsyan. Sirusho's musical style reflects the Armenian traditional sounds mixed with modern music." ;

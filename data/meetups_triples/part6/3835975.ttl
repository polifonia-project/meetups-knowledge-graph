        mtp:hasAbstract        "Albert Eli Coury (October 21, 1934 â€“ August 8, 2013) was an American music record executive and producer who was vice-president of Capitol Records, co-founder of RSO Records, founder of and general manager of Geffen Records. Coury released some of the best selling albums of all time such as the soundtracks of Saturday Night Fever, Grease and Flashdance, and albums such as Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon and Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction, which earned him the title of the \"Vince Lombardi of the record business\". In his career that expanded almost 40 years, Coury helped to develop the careers of artists such as The Beatles, Nat King Cole, The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, Bee Gees, Eric Clapton, Irene Cara, Glen Campbell, Bob Seger, Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, Don Henley, Cher and Linda Ronstadt." ;

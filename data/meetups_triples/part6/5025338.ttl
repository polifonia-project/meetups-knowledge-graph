He was the founding publisher of conservative Encounter Books in California and held that position from 1998 until he resigned in 2005. The company moved from San Francisco to New York City, and Collier was replaced as publisher by Roger Kimball. With David Horowitz, Collier wrote many books that made The New York Times Best Seller list and was described by the New York Times Book Review as \"the premier biographer of American dynastic tragedy.\" His book Medal of Honor: Profiles of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty (2003) profiled living recipients of the Medal." ;

She was born Eva Farrance and joined a musical chorus while still in her teens. She appeared in vaudeville and on Broadway with Weber and Fields and was spotted by stage director Julian Mitchell for a role in the 1903 Babes in Toyland. \"The Blue Mouse\" was written by Clyde Fitch and Fitch himself selected Barrison for a role in the play. Barrison was plagued by health problems the last two years of her life. She died on November 1, 1912 in Toronto at the age of 30." ;

He was signed as a street free agent by the Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 where he played for three seasons before being traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He played college football for the Central Arkansas Bears. In a 2012 game against the BC Lions, Jackson returned a missed field goal deep in his own end zone for a 129-yard touchdown. When I caught it, I was going to take a knee, but I seen two guys outside, and we had two guys, I always believe in my guys up front. — Jackson on the touchdown" ;

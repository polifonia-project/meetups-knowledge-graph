        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clifford Gladwin (3 April 1916 â€“ 10 April 1988) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Derbyshire from 1939 to 1958 and in eight Tests for England from 1947 to 1949. He took over 1,600 first-class wickets. A tall right-arm medium-fast seam bowler of great accuracy and consistency, Gladwin formed, with Les Jackson, the most feared new ball attack in the English first-class game for a dozen years after World War II. Gladwin was both penetrative and mean, with around a third of his overs being maidens, and in thirteen full seasons he took 100 or more wickets twelve times, usually at an average of under 20 runs per wicket. Cricket writer, Colin Bateman noted that \"Gladwin was so proud of his miserly bowling, that he would correct the scorers at the close of play if there was an error in their figures\"." ;

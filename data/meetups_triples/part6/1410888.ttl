        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joe Michael \"Dusty\" Hill (May 19, 1949 â€“ July 28, 2021) was an American musician who was the bassist of the rock band ZZ Top for more than 50 years. He also sang lead and backing vocals and played keyboards. Hill was born in Dallas, Texas, and as a child, he began performing music with his brother, Rocky Hill. In 1968, he and drummer Frank Beard joined guitarist Billy Gibbons in the recently-formed ZZ Top, and went on to release albums, including the bestselling Eliminator (1983). Hill favored simple compositions and a \"big\", distorted sound. Critics described his basslines as a critical part of ZZ Top's sound, complementing Gibbons' guitar showmanship. Hill was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of ZZ Top in 2004. He died in 2021 after a period of declining health. He was replaced by the band's longtime guitar tech Elwood Francis, in line with his wishes." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Crowd Lu (Chinese: 盧廣仲; pinyin: Lú Guǎngzhòng; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Lô͘ Kóng-tiōng; born 15 July 1985) is a Taiwanese singer, songwriter and actor. He is also nicknamed \"Vitas Lu\" after making a parody of the song Opera No. 2 by the Russian singer Vitas, having the ability to hit the same high notes. Due to a serious car accident in his first year at Tamkang University, Lu learned to play guitar during his hospitalization. The following year, Lu won first prize for musical composition and solo performance and proceeded to once again take the gold in composition and become the crowd favorite at National Chengchi University. In 2009, Lu won Best New Artist and Best Composer at the 20th Golden Melody Awards." ;

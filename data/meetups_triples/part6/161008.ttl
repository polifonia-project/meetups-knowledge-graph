        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Barry RA (11 October 1741 â€“ 22 February 1806) was an Irish painter, best remembered for his six-part series of paintings entitled in the Great Room of the Royal Society of Arts in London. Because of his determination to create art according to his own principles rather than those of his patrons, he is also noted for being one of the earliest romantic painters working in Britain, though as an artist few rated him highly until the fully comprehensive 1983 exhibition at the Tate Gallery led to a reassessment of this \"notoriously belligerent personality\", who emerged as one of the most important Irish artists. He was also notable as a profound influence on William Blake." ;

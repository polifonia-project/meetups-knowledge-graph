        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter Hoyt Brown (October 16, 1936 â€“ December 12, 2017) was a politician who held office as an at-large council member in the city of Houston, Texas. Known locally as \"Peter Brown,\" he was a candidate for the 2009 Houston mayoral race, to succeed then Mayor Bill White, who vacated the position due to term limits. Although an independent poll conducted by 11 News/ KUHF Houston Public Radio poll in late October 2009 showed Brown holding the lead in the mayor's race with a nine-point lead over his nearest opponent, he was eliminated in the November 3, 2009, election." ;

Monarquia Indiana was the \"prime text of Mexican history, and was destined to influence all subsequent chronicles until the twentieth century.\" It was used by later historians, the Franciscan Augustin de Vetancurt and most importantly by 18th-century Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero. No English translation of this work has ever been published." ;

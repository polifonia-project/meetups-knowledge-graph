        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexander James Murphy OBE (born 22 April 1939) is an English former professional rugby league footballer, and coach of the mid to late 20th century. Known as 'Murphy the Mouth' (or \"Yapper\" by some referees) and regarded as one of the greatest halfbacks in the history of the British game, he represented Great Britain in 27 Tests and his club career was played at three clubs, St. Helens, Leigh and Warrington. Murphy assumed a player-coach role of the last two clubs and expanded his coaching role toward the end of his playing career to include clubs such as Wigan, Salford and Huddersfield. He later returned to both Warrington and Leigh respectively as a football manager. He was the first player to captain three different clubs to victory in the Challenge Cup Final ." ;

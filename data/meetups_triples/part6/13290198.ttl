        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Wells (born October 30, 1947) is a retired American professional wrestler and Canadian Football League player who competed in North American regional promotions during the early 1970s and 1980s including the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW), Stampede Wrestling, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), most notably as the opponent of Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts at WrestleMania 2. It was during this live PPV match that Roberts, after having defeated Wells, had placed his pet snake \"Damien\" on Wells causing him to foam at the mouth. A popular star in the San Francisco-area during the late 1970s, he is also credited as being the only African-American to hold the now defunct NWA United States Heavyweight Championship." ;

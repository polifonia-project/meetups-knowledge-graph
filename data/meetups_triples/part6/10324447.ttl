He was born in Mount Isa, Queensland on 4 June 1981 and learned to play from his uncle, an elder of the Wannyi, Lardil and Kalkadunga tribes of Western Queensland. He is widely recognised as one of Australia's finest traditional didgeridoo players and a leading didgeridoo player in the classical world. \"I'm doing what I love,\" Barton says. \"I want to take the oldest culture in the world and blend it with Europe's rich musical legacy.\" Barton has been featured on the ABC television program, Australian Story. Life for William BartonTaught to play the didgeridoo from an early age by Aboriginal Elders, by the age of 12 Barton was working in Sydney, playing for Aboriginal dance troupes. At the age of 15 he toured America, after which he decided he wanted to become a soloist rather than a backing musician and started to study different kinds of music. In 1998, he made his classical debut with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, and became Australia's first didgeridoo artist-in-residence with a symphony orchestra. In November 2022, Barton was named Queensland Australian of the Year." ;

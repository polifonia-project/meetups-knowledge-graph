        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas V. Morris (born 1952), is an American philosopher. He is a former Professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. He is a founderer of the Morris Institute for Human Valu , and author of several books. He is also a business and motivational speaker, applying philosophical themes and concepts to business and professional life. Morris sees the past century's focus on technical efforts in analytic philosophy as having given philosophy the image of an arcane or irrelevant endeavor. He has attempted to make philosophy widely accessible, rediscovering the practical side of philosophy, and introducing people to the themes and philosophers." ;

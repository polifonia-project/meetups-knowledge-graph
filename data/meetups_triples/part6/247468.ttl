        mtp:hasAbstract        "Óscar Gutiérrez (born December 11, 1974), better known by his ring name Rey Mysterio, is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Mysterio is credited for popularizing cruiserweight wrestling, and is one of the world's most recognizable lucha libre wrestlers. The nephew of Rey Misterio Sr., Mysterio began his professional wrestling career in 1989, at age 14, on the independent circuit, before signing with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) in 1992. After a brief period performing for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Mysterio departed to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996. In WCW, Mysterio helped popularize lucha libre in the United States, which led to the rise of cruiserweight wrestling divisions, while he also won the WCW Cruiserweight Championship five times and the WCW World Tag Team Championship three times. He then wrestled for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), and joined World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002. In WWE, Mysterio won the Cruiserweight Championship three times, the World Heavyweight Championship twice, the Intercontinental Championship twice, the United States Championship twice, the WWE Championship once, and the Tag Team Championship four times. He is WWE's 21st Triple Crown and Grand Slam champion, is a Royal Rumble match winner, and has headlined several WWE pay-per-view events. Mysterio departed WWE in 2015, and appeared in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and AAA, before returning to WWE in 2018, winning the U.S. Championship twice and SmackDown Tag Team Championship once with his son Dominik." ;

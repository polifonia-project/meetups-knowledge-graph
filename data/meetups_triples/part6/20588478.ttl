Darci and Getúlio Vargas, whom she married in March 1911, had five children. However, the president was an unfaithful husband. Aimée de Heeren, later the daughter-in-law of Fernanda Wanamaker, was reported to be one of his mistresses. She became a notable philanthropist and founded many charitable organizations." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ebba Maria Knigge Forsberg, (born in Stockholm, Sweden on 31 July 1964) is a Swedish singer and actress. She sings solo and was a member of many musical band projects, most notably in Traste Lindéns Kvintett. Forsberg's family moved from Sweden to Tortola in the West Indies when she was five years old, although her older sister Kajsa Ribbing returned to Sweden after only a year. The rest of the family stayed until Forsberg was 12, at which point they moved to South Africa for eight years before Forsberg moved back to Sweden. In 1996, she was signed by Guy Oseary to Maverick Records. Her first album for Maverick, Been There, was the subject of \"intense advance buzz.\" Been There featured lyrics written by Forsberg's older sister, Kajsa Ribbing. In addition to her own music, she has released two albums dedicated to international artists, with Swedish versions of songs from Bob Dylan (2007) and Leonard Cohen (2009). The translations were by Mikael Wiehe. She had her acting career in lead role in the television series Anderssons älskarinna. Ebba Forsberg is the daughter of Lars Lennart Forsberg. She is married to with whom she has a child and two step-children. She also has a daughter (b. 1989) from an earlier marriage. She and her husband run the Eboth record label." ;

The actor also often appears at the Salzburg Festival and played there the title role in the play Jedermann numerous times. In addition, he has also appeared in more than sixty films since 1980. Simonischek is perhaps best-known to international audiences for his leading role in the critically acclaimed comedy-drama Toni Erdmann (2016). He grew up in Markt Hartmannsdorf, a municipality in the state of Styria, where his father was a dentist. His son Max Simonischek is also an actor." ;

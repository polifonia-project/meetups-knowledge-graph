In the 1990s, he mostly appeared in smaller roles in film, such as Outbreak (1995) and television. Dempsey was also in Scream 3 (2000) where he played the role of Detective Mark Kincaid. He was successful in landing a lead role in Sweet Home Alabama (2002), a surprise box office hit.

Prior to the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey declared that he would \"walk away\" from acting if he could and dedicate himself full-time to motorsports." ;

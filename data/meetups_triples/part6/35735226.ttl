        mtp:hasAbstract        "James D. Rolfe (born July 10, 1980) is an American YouTuber, online personality, actor, and filmmaker. He is best known for creating and starring in the retrogaming web series Angry Video Game Nerd (2004â€“present), a joint production between his Cinemassacre Productions, GameTrailers, and ScrewAttack. His spin off projects include reviews of other retro films, television series, and board games. He is considered a pioneer of internet gaming videos, inspiring the younger generation of gamers to make their own videos in his style, and at a point was one of the most popular content creators on YouTube. Rolfe began creating homemade video productions in the late 1980s, and has created more than 270 videos throughout his career. His career as an online celebrity took off in 2004 with the beginning of Angry Video Game Nerd. Two years later, Rolfe gained mainstream attention after one of his videos went viral upon being published on YouTube. In the interim, he filmed videos he created on his own and most of them have been released on his website, Cinemassacre." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nonito Gonzales Donaire Jr. Order of Lakandula (/dɒˈnɛər/; Tagalog: [noˈnito gonˈsalɛs doˈnaɪre]; born November 16, 1982) is a Filipino American professional boxer. He has held multiple world championships in four weight classes from flyweight to featherweight, and is the oldest boxer in history to win a bantamweight world title, as well as being the first three-time champion in that weight class. Donaire has also held world championships in three consecutive decades: the 2000s, 2010s and 2020s, being the sixth boxer to do so after Evander Holyfield, Manny Pacquiao, Bernard Hopkins, Érik Morales, and Floyd Mayweather Jr. In total, Donaire has held nine world titles by the main four boxing sanctioning bodies. He has also held the IBO flyweight title, the WBA interim super flyweight title, and the Ring magazine and lineal super bantamweight titles. As of June 2021, Donaire is ranked as the world's second best active bantamweight by The Ring, the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, BoxRec, and ESPN. Donaire is popularly known as \"The Filipino Flash\" due to his fast hand speed and punching power, and is a two-time winner of The Ring's Knockout of the Year award, in 2007 and 2011. He reached a peak pound for pound ranking of third by The Ring in 2011, and was named Fighter of the Year in 2012 by the Boxing Writers Association of America. Donaire is one of a select few Asian boxers to win world titles in at least four weight classes, along with fellow Filipinos Manny Pacquiao and Donnie Nietes." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michel Drucker, CQ (born 12 September 1942 in Vire) is a popular French journalist and TV host. He has been on screen for so long on various shows and different networks, both public and private, that he once said that some people joked that he was included in the price of their TV sets. Drucker's younger brother, Jacques, is a doctor, and his older brother, Jean, was a television executive. He started a journalistic career in 1965 at the ORTF as sports reporter and commentator. Although he kept doing live coverage of major soccer matches until 1986, he soon turned to hosting variety shows, such as on Antenne 2 in the 1980s, then on TF1 in the 1990s, then finally on France 2 every Sunday afternoon since 1998. Drucker is known for his polite, toned-down attitude towards show-business stars, and is best known outside France for the incident between Serge Gainsbourg and American singer Whitney Houston on the television programme, ." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carson Amanda \"Carsie\" Blanton (born July 22, 1985) is an American singer-songwriter based in Philadelphia, who performs on guitar. Blanton has released eight studio albums and three EPs, all with a \"pay what you please\" pricing strategy. Blanton wrote \"My true calling as an artist is to share…What I actually want to do is make beautiful music and then give it to everyone, regardless of what they give me back.\" Fresh Air called Blanton \"one of those hard-headed open-hearted protestors who can make revolution sound desirable to your body, even if your mind wants to resist it,” in reference to her 2021 album Love and Rage." ;

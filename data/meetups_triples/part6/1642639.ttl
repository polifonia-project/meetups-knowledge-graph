        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Quinn Jones (born August 19, 1978) is an American actor and a former American football running back who played 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Virginia. He was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals seventh overall in the 2000 NFL Draft, and played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in addition to the New York Jets, Chicago Bears and Kansas City Chiefs. He retired among the top 25 leading rushers in NFL history (currently 26th, after LeSean McCoy passed him), and a member of the 10,000 rushing yards club. In September 2019 he was nominated for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2020. In 2013, performing under the name Thomas Q. Jones due to the SAG-AFTRA's unique stage name requirements, he began an acting career. Among his credits are 2015's Straight Outta Compton and a recurring role in the Luke Cage series." ;

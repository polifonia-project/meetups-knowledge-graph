Among her television appearances, she portrayed Admiral Rollman in two episodes of the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: \"Past Prologue\" in the first season and \"Whispers\" in the second. Bay was one of the Original Six, a group of women directors who created the Women's Steering Committee of the Directors Guild of America, to protest against gender discrimination in Hollywood. Bay has directed several documentaries, and the American premiere of Shakespeare's Will (2007). She returned to directing in 2018 with Eve, a film addressing issues of aging and mourning. She wrote the script while grieving for her husband, Leonard Nimoy." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rand Miller (born January 17, 1959) is a C.E.O. and co-founder of Cyan Worlds (originally Cyan). He and brother Robyn Miller became famous due to the success of their computer game Myst, which remained the all-time best-selling computer game from its release in 1993 until that record was surpassed by The Sims nearly a decade later. Rand also worked on the game's sequel, Riven, and later reprised his role as protagonist Atrus in Myst III: Exile, realMyst, Uru, Myst IV: Revelation, and Myst V: End of Ages. He also co-authored Myst novels The Book of Atrus, The Book of Ti'ana, and The Book of D'ni. He remains the C.E.O. of Cyan Worlds." ;

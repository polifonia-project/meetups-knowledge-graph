        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Stubbs (born 13 September 1962 in London) is a British music journalist. He grew up in Leeds and in the early Eighties was a student at the University of Oxford where he was a close friend of Simon Reynolds. The two were part of the Oxford-based collective that in 1984 launched the pop journal Monitor and then in 1986 both joined Melody Maker as staff writers. Stubbs remained at Melody Maker for a dozen years. He combined his serious writing career with writing the humorous \"Talk Talk Talk\" section, which featured the character of Mr Agreeable who would insult sacred cows with barrages of swear words (asterisked out to comply with IPC Media regulations)." ;

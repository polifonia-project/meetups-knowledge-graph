        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Svensson (born 20 November 1977) is a Swedish drummer. He is currently a member of the Swedish supergroup The Halo Effect (2021–) and formerly a drummer of the metal bands In Flames, Sacrilege GBG (also the vocalist) and Diabolique. In 1998, Svensson took Björn Gelotte's job occupation as drummer when Gelotte switched from drums to guitars. In Flames' first album with him as drummer along with Peter Iwers was Colony, and it was released the following year. He rejoined Sacrilege GBG in 2006. Svensson decided to leave In Flames after finishing up the Europe tour in November 2015. He now brews beer at his brewery outside Gothenburg, Odd Island Brewing, together with former In Flames bandmate Peter Iwers, among others. Svensson is a self-taught drummer. He looks up to Vinnie Paul of Pantera as a big influence on his playing." ;

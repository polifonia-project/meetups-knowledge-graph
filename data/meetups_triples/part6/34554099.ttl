She was nominated for a BAFTA award for Game On in 1997. Game On was said to be: \"a part of a zeitgeist that came to define a generation\" and was a \"sitcom that was so of its time, that it took its name from a catchphrase of the decade.\" She studied English and Drama at Goldsmiths College, University of London." ;

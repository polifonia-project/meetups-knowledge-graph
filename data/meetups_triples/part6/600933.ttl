        mtp:hasAbstract        "Norman Julius \"Boomer\" Esiason (/əˈsaɪ.əsən/; born April 17, 1961) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons, primarily with the Cincinnati Bengals. He was selected in the second round of the 1984 NFL Draft by the Bengals, where he spent 10 non-consecutive seasons. Esiason was also a member of the New York Jets and Arizona Cardinals. During his playing career, Esiason was named to four Pro Bowls and one first-team All-Pro selection. His most successful season came with the Bengals in 1988 when he won NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) and led the team to a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl XXIII, which ended in a close defeat. After nine years in Cincinnati, Esiason spent three seasons with the Jets and one season with the Cardinals before returning to the Bengals for his final season in 1997. Since retiring from football, Esiason has worked as a football analyst for CBS Sports on The NFL Today and Showtime's Inside the NFL and was previously with ABC, HBO, and Westwood One. He also hosts the morning sports radio program Boomer and Gio on WFAN in New York." ;

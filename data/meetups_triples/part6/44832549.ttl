        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Young-hoon (이영훈, 李榮薰, born 1951 in Daegu, South Korea), Lee Yong-hoon, Rhee Yong-hoon, or Yi Yŏnghun is a former professor of economics at Seoul National University and the president of the (낙성대경제연구소). He is a member of the Textbook Forum of the New Right Party.He is known for undertaking new positivistic research on the Economy of Joseon. He challenged a common belief in Korea that—Japanese colonial rule and development has been an absolute evil—by arguing that the number of comfort women (largely regarded in South Korea as sex slaves) and forced laborers is exaggerated in Korea's textbooks. In an internet lecture broadcast in August 2016 Lee contends: “The comfort woman system was a licensed prostitution system under the control of the military…. The comfort women were not sex slaves…. Korean comfort women were recruited by pimps by means of advance payments and outright fraud…. There is no evidence that there were 200,000 Korean comfort women. The number is somewhere around 5,000”. Comfort Women included women from a multitude of countries including Korea, China, Taiwan, Japan, and other parts of Asia. After raising doubts by saying, \"(If there's any) Tell me which scholar is actually claiming that Governor-General of Korea forcibly transported comfort women\", he was criticised in South Korea." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Buddy Rogers (born Herman Gustav Rohde Jr.; February 20, 1921 â€“ June 26, 1992), better known by the ring name \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, was an American professional wrestler who was one of the biggest professional wrestling stars in the beginning of the television era. His performances influenced future professional wrestlers, including \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, who used Rogers's nickname, as well as his look, attitude and finishing hold, the figure-four leglock. He was also known for his rivalry with Lou Thesz, both in and out of the ring. Rogers was a thirteen-time world champion, notably holding the top championship in both the NWA and the WWWF, today known as WWE (he was the inaugural WWWF World Heavyweight Champion). He is one of three men in history to have held both championships, along with Ric Flair and AJ Styles." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Artur Pizarro (born Lisbon, 1968) is an internationally-acclaimed Portuguese concert pianist. Designated with the prestigious title of Yamaha Artist, Pizarro won first prize in the 1987 Vianna da Motta International Music Competition and first prize in the 1990 Leeds International Pianoforte Competition. His piano technic/knowledge is linked directly to Liszt himself (3 generations apart): his teacher (for 17 years – and also stepfather) was a great portuguese pianist – Sequeira Costa-, whom had studied with José Vianna Da Motta, another world famous portuguese pianist; and this was one of the last pupils of Liszt. He performs internationally in solo recitals, in duos, with chamber music groups, and as a soloist with the world's leading orchestras, including the Gulbenkian Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. He has an extensive discography and record deals with Linn Records, Naxos Records, Hyperion, and Collins Classics, among others." ;

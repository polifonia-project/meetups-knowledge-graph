        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elaine Marjorie Brody (née Breslow; December 4, 1922 – July 9, 2014) was an American gerontologist and sociologist, who studied cases on elderly Americans tended to by caregivers. In a career lasting six decades, she was one of the first social workers to research her clients, particularly of \"women in the middle\", a term she used to refer to women who raised their children and cared for their elderly parents simultaneously. Brody contributed to the foundation of gerontology, and her works established a precedent in this field. After graduating from the City College of New York, Brody left the University of Pittsburgh with a master's degree in social work. She was employed as director of human resources and associate director at the Philadelphia Geriatric Center, which later expanded to researching the effects of aging elderly persons and their families. Additionally, Brody taught psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and served on several editorial boards of professional journals and review committees of multiple foundations. Brody published more than 200 academic articles and six books on her research and received numerous awards for it." ;

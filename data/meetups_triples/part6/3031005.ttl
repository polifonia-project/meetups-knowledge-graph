Ordained to the priesthood in 1958, Conti spent most of his life in the service of the Church, being consecrated Bishop of Aberdeen in 1977 where he served until his appointment to Glasgow. Conti died in November 2022 after what was reported as a ‘short illness’ in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrew James Dalrymple Gill (1 January 1956 â€“ 1 February 2020) was a British musician and record producer. He was the lead guitarist for the rock band Gang of Four, which he co-founded in 1976. Gill was known for his angular, jagged style of guitar on albums such as Entertainment! (1979) and Solid Gold (1981) and hit singles such as \"At Home He's a Tourist\", \"Damaged Goods\", \"Anthrax\", \"What We All Want\" and \"I Love a Man in a Uniform\". In addition to his work with Gang of Four, Gill was also a record producer, and produced or co-produced all of the band's albums. He also produced albums for artists such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Jesus Lizard, the Stranglers, the Futureheads, Michael Hutchence, Killing Joke, Polysics, Fight Like Apes, Therapy? and the Young Knives. Gill was noted for a distinctive rhythm guitar style and sound, emphasizing a treble-heavy attack likened by one critic to \"metal splintering.\" He favoured tight linkage with drums and bass, and unlike many guitarists shunned the \"warmer\" sound of valve amplifiers in favour of the \"coldness\" and \"thinness\" of a Fender Stratocaster through transistor amps." ;

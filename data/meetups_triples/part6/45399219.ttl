He was the frontman for Black Sheep, a 1980s metal band that featured a number of noteworthy musicians throughout its line-up changes. The last known line-up consisted of Basse on bass, Marshall Harrison and Brian Conroy on guitars, and James Kottak on drums. Other members included Slash, Paul Gilbert, Randy Castillo, Kurt James , Ed DeGenaro and Mitch Perry. In 1985, the band released a full-length album, \"Trouble In The Streets\", on William and Wesley Hein's Enigma Records for which Billboard Magazine noted Basse as the producer.

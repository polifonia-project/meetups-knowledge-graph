        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stu Marshall is a guitarist from Sydney, Australia. He is a member of Sydney heavy metal band Empires of Eden and Paindivision. Marshall is best known as a member of the Sydney metal band Dungeon with whom he recorded three albums and toured extensively throughout Australia, Europe and Japan between 2001 and 2005. After many years playing in cover and tribute bands, Marshall joined Dungeon as the replacement for Dale Corney in late 2001 and made his debut with the band at the annual Metal for the Brain festival. While most of the group's album A Rise to Power had been recorded by the time he joined, several tracks feature Marshall's solos. He also played on the studio albums One Step Beyond and Resurrection and on the live DVD Under the Rising Sun that was made during the band's 2003 tour of Japan. Marshall also contributed backing vocals on the Lord album A Personal Journey and he sang lead vocals on the Thin Lizzy cover \"Waiting for an Alibi\" that was a bonus track on the Australian version of Resurrection. In late 2005 Marshall founded Paindivision, originally with Dungeon's Tim Yatras on drums but before this band's first live performance the name was changed to 20 Grams. Shortlyafterwards, Dungeon disbanded. Marshall finalised the 20 Grams line-up by mid-2006. The group supported Black Label Society in Sydney a short time later. Following this, 20 Grams reverted to the name Pain Division and a four-track EP was recorded and released late in the year. At the beginning of 2007, Pain Division announced a deal with Wollongong label Riot! A self-titled album was released in October 2007. Dan Quinlan joined the band on bass guitar, who toured with the band in Japan on the November tour. In November 2007 he released a solo album called Altered States. A second Paindivision album was released in 2008 with a third due to be recorded during 2010; however this band now appears to have been on extended hiatus as Marshall concentrates on Death Dealer, a power metal band featuring Ross the Boss." ;

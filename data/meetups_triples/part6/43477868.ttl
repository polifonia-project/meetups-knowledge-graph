        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carl (Karl) Georg Ludwig Theodor Herwig Joseph Robert (8 March 1850, Marburg – 17 January 1922, Halle an der Saale) was a German classical philologist and archaeologist. He began his studies of ancient philology and archaeology at the University of Bonn, where he was a student of Otto Jahn, Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz and Anton Springer. In 1870 he began service as a volunteer in the Hessian Infantry Battalion No. 11 during the Franco-Prussian War. Afterwards, he resumed his studies at the University of Berlin under Theodor Mommsen, Adolf Kirchhoff and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff. In 1873 he obtained his doctorate in Berlin with the thesis De Apollodori bibliotheca. From a travel grant by the German Archaeological Institute, he conducted scientific research in Greece and Italy. In 1877 he became an associate professor at Berlin, attaining a full professorship in 1880. In 1890 he was appointed chair of classical archaeology and philology at the University of Halle. At Halle he served as director of its archaeological museum, of which, he made important improvements via new acquisitions. In the 1920s the museum was renamed the \"Robertinum\" in honor of his accomplishments." ;

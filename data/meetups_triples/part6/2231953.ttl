        mtp:hasAbstract        "The Reverend Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing FRS, FLS (6 February 1835, London â€“ 8 July 1926, Royal Tunbridge Wells) was a British zoologist, who described himself as \"a serf to natural history, principally employed about Crustacea\". Educated in London and Oxford, he only took to natural history in his thirties, having worked as a teacher until then. Although an ordained Anglican priest, Stebbing promoted Darwinism in a number of popular works, and was banned from preaching as a result. His scientific works mostly concerned crustaceans, especially the Amphipoda and Isopoda, the most notable being his work on the amphipods of the Challenger expedition. His zoological author abbreviation is Stebbing. Species he authored are listed at Category:Taxa named by Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing and by this query." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donald Lee Morton (September 12, 1934 – January 10, 2014) was an American Surgical Oncologist who was best known for developing sentinel lymph node evaluation, a procedure that, by some estimates, saves the U.S. healthcare system nearly $4 billion annually in the treatment of melanoma and breast cancer. At the time of his death, he was Chief of the melanoma program and co-director of the surgical oncology fellowship program at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, California, now known as Saint John’s Cancer Institute. He published in excess of 600 articles in peer reviewed journals and received funding for his research from the National Institutes of Health for 35 years. Dr. Morton trained more than 100 postdoctoral fellows, most of whom hold academic positions in medical schools or cancer institutes." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "At 4:43 p.m. on August 12, 2013, Tiffany Daniels (born March 11, 1988) left her job as a theater technician at Pensacola State College in Pensacola, Florida, United States, telling her supervisor that she would not be returning for a few days but did not say why. Although she returned home briefly afterwards, Daniels's housemate was busy with a telephone conversation and did not see her. She has not been seen since. Because she had told her supervisor she would be taking time off, Daniels was not reported missing until the end of the week, after she had failed to return to work. Her friends and family were unaware of any plans she might have made that would explain her absence. Daniels's housemate also reported that she had left unusually early for work that day after some strange activity even earlier that morning. A security camera on the Pensacola Beach Bridge connecting Gulf Breeze and Santa Rosa islands recorded her car crossing the bridge almost three hours after she had left work. Eight days after her disappearance, the vehicle was found at a parking lot in Pensacola Beach, along with her bicycle, purse and cell phone. Residents in the area said the car had only been there a few days, and reported seeing an unidentified male around it. Two unidentified fingerprints were found on the car, but a search of the surrounding beach area found no trace of Daniels. Several theories have been put forth to account for Daniels's disappearance, ranging from foul play to an accidental drowning. Based on an anonymous tip and several reported sightings further west along Interstate 10, Daniels's family believes she was a victim of human trafficking and may still be alive. The case was the subject of a 2016 episode of Investigation Discovery's Disappeared." ;

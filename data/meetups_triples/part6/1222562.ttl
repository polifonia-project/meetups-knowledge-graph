        mtp:hasAbstract        "Luis Palau Jr. (November 27, 1934 – March 11, 2021) was an international Christian evangelist living in the Portland area in Oregon, United States. He was born in Argentina and moved to Portland in his mid-twenties to enroll in a graduate program in Biblical studies. Palau had a long and close relationship with evangelist Billy Graham, and has been characterized by many as Graham's successor. \"One of the world’s leading evangelical Christian figures,\" he is known for his strong appeal to young people, and for his efforts to reach out to secular leaders to address issues like homelessness. In 2007, Palau was estimated to have shared the message of Jesus Christ with 25 million people in 70 nations. Palau's ministry employs 70 people in their headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon and another 25 around the world which include offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina and London, England. In January 2018, Palau shared on Facebook and YouTube that he had stage-four lung cancer. In November 2018, he told a reporter for the Beaverton Valley Times that his cancer had \"stabilized for now\". His health worsened in early 2021, however, leading to hospitalization in February and his death in March 2021." ;

He was one of the best centres in the world throughout the 1990s due to his attacking prowess, formidable defence and playmaking ability. He became one of only 21 players who have won the Rugby World Cup on multiple occasions. As well as inside centre, Horan also played fly-half and earned one international cap on the wing." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rupert Alexander Lloyd Grint (/ɡrɪnt/; born 24 August 1988) is an English actor. Grint rose to fame for his role as Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter film series. He was cast as Weasley at age eleven, having previously acted only in school plays and his local theatre group. Since then, he continued his work on film, television, and theatre. Beginning in 2002, he began to work outside of the Harry Potter franchise, with a co-leading role in Thunderpants. He has had starring roles in Driving Lessons, a dramedy released in 2006, and Cherrybomb, a limited-release drama film in 2010. He co-starred with Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt in the comedy Wild Target. His first film project after the Harry Potter series was a supporting role in the 2012 anti-war film Into the White. In 2013, his film CBGB was released, and he was cast in CBS's new show Super Clyde. He made his stage debut in Jez Butterworth's Mojo in October 2013 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London. In 2014, he voiced the character of Josh in Postman Pat: The Movie; and from 2017 to 2018, he executive-produced and starred in the television series Snatch, based on the film of the same name. Since 2019, he stars in the Apple TV+ psychological horror series Servant." ;

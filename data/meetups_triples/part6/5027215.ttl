        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kurt Kasznar (born Kurt Servischer; August 13, 1913 â€“ August 6, 1979) was an Austrian-American stage, film and television actor who played roles on Broadway, appearing in the original Broadway productions of Waiting for Godot, The Sound of Music and Barefoot in the Park. He also appeared in feature films and had many notable parts in television, including the science fiction series Land of the Giants. \"A big, glib, dapper man who spoke with an accent, he was almost always cast as some sort of a Continental gentleman,\" reported The New York Times. As a soldier in World War II, Kasznar was among the first U.S. Army photographers to film the ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki." ;

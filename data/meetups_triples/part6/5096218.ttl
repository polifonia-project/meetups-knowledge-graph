        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Frank Rieley III (November 24, 1942 – April 17, 2015) was an American record producer, songwriter, and disc jockey who managed the Beach Boys between mid-1970 and late 1973. He is credited with guiding them back to popular acclaim and was described by New Statesman as \"a radio DJ turned career mentor.\" Rieley co-wrote a total of ten songs included on the Beach Boys' albums Surfs Up (1971), Carl and the Passions – \"So Tough\" (1972), and Holland (1973). He also sang lead on the Surf's Up track \"A Day in the Life of a Tree\" and narrated Brian Wilson's fairy tale Mount Vernon and Fairway (1972). Following his work with the Beach Boys, Rieley collaborated with artists such as Kool & the Gang, Ride, and Jaye Muller (aka Count Jaye). In 1975, Rieley released a solo album, Western Justice. He died in 2015 at the age of 72." ;

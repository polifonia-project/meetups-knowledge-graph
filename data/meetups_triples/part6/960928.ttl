        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Carter Walker Jr. (born June 25, 1947) is an American actor and comedian. Walker portrayed James Evans Jr. (\"J.J.\"), the older son of Florida and James Evans Sr., on the CBS television series Good Times, which ran from 1974 to 1979, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1975 and 1976 for his role. While on the show, Walker's character used the catchphrase \"Dyn-O-Mite!\" which he also used in his midâ€“1970s TV commercial for a Panasonic line of cassette and 8-track tape players and a 2021 and 2022 Medicare commercial. He also starred in Let's Do It Again with John Amos, and The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened with James Earl Jones. Walker continues to tour the country with his stand-up comedy routine." ;

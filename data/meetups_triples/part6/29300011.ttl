        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tyisha Shenee Miller (March 9, 1979 â€“ December 28, 1998) was an African American woman from Rubidoux, California. She was shot and killed by police officers called by family members who could not wake her as she lay unconscious in a car with a gun on her lap. The incident sparked demonstrations against police anti-blackness. The officers involved were fired from Riverside Police Department but did not face prosecution due to insufficient evidence, and were later afforded full back-pay after the decision to terminate their employment was found to be an \"abuse of administrative discretion,\" though they were not reinstated." ;

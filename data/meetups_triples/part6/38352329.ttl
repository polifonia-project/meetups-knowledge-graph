Her first involvement in the music industry was at the age of 13 when she released the track \"Little Horn\". Since then she has sold 25 million albums across Asia. Cheng's latest album was Collaborations the album, which was produced by Grammy Award winning producer KC Porter. Cheng is also a keen player of the erhu, a traditional two-string violin. She was taught to play at a young age by her father, and still uses the instrument in her music today. She studied in the United States and learned English, learning more about Western music in the process. She was the first Chinese national to have her music videos air on national television in China in the 1980s." ;

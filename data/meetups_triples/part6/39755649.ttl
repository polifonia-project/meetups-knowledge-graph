He rose to fame as a singer during the summer of 2003, when he released his debut single, \"La canzone del capitano\", which became a hit in Italy. Before retiring from his music career in 2007, he released three studio albums, and he competed in the Sanremo Music Festival three times. He is the founder of Italian EDM trio \"We Are PresidentS\". In 2004, he was also a contestant of the Italian reality show L'isola dei famosi. Three years later, he became the co-presented of the show. Starting from 2008, Facchinetti presented the first four series of X Factor, the Italian version of the talent show created by Simon Cowell in the United Kingdom. When RAI decided to discontinue the show, Facchinetti presented Star Academy, which replaced X Factor. Together with his father Roby Facchinetti, he was part of a duo coach on the third series of talent show The Voice of Italy. He was one of the Italian commentators for the second and third seasons of Netflix's Ultimate Beastmaster alongside Bianca Balti." ;

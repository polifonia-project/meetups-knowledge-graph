        mtp:hasAbstract        "Samantha Newark (born 27 June 1967) is an English-born American musician, singer and actress. She is best known for her voice-over work as the speaking voice of Jem and Jerrica in the animated cartoon series Jem. As a teenager, Newark became a voice-over talent in mainstream television. Her work on \"Jem\" produced a serious cult following that persists to this day. She lent her voice to many radio and TV projects while writing and performing her original music as a solo recording artist in Los Angeles CA, Nashville TN and Dallas, Texas. In 2015 Newark appeared in the live action feature film adaptation on Jem and the Holograms directed by Jon Chu." ;

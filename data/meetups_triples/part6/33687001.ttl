        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tomas Costanza (born September 2, 1976) is a certified-platinum American record producer/songwriter and owner of the Killingsworth Recording Company. Born in Massapequa, New York, he was first noted in the music industry as the lead singer and guitarist for the band Diffuser. In addition to being signed to Hollywood Records in 2000, several of the band's songs were featured on major motion picture soundtracks including Freaky Friday, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Mean Girls and Mission: Impossible 2. As a record producer, Costanza has worked with artists such as Macklemore, Boys Like Girls, Darren Criss, Rachel Platten, 2 Chainz, Icona Pop and Trixie Mattel. Costanza's big break came in 2011 after producing X-Factor finalist Katie Waissel's debut album which reached #1 on the U.K. charts and remained there for five weeks." ;

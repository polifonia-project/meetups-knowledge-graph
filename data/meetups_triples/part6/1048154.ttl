        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harbhajan Singh Khalsa (born Harbhajan Singh Puri) (August 26, 1929 â€“ October 6, 2004), also known as Yogi Bhajan and Siri Singh Sahib to his followers, was an Indian-born American entrepreneur, yoga guru, and spiritual teacher. He introduced his version of Kundalini Yoga to the United States. He was the spiritual director of the 3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization) Foundation (and business ventures), with over 300 centers in 35 countries. Harbhajan Singh has been accused posthumously of sexual abuse by hundreds of his female followers; an investigation called the Olive Branch Report found the allegations most likely true." ;

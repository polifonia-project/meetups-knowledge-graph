        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marguerite Scypion, also known in court files as Marguerite, (c.1770s â€“ after 1836) was an African-Natchez woman, born into slavery in St. Louis, then located in French Upper Louisiana. She was held first by Joseph Tayon and later by Jean Pierre Chouteau, one of the most powerful men in the city. In 1805, two years after St. Louis came under US rule, Marguerite filed the first \"freedom suit\" in the city's circuit court, 41 years before Dred Scott and his wife Harriet filed their more well-known case. In November 1836 Marguerite, her children; her sister and other descendants of , her mother, finally won their case as free people of color. The unanimous jury decision in their favor was based on their maternal descent from a Natchez woman, as Indian slavery had been ended by the Spanish in 1769. The trial venue was moved to Jefferson County, because the Chouteau family was so powerful in St. Louis. The decision withstood appeals to the state and the United States Supreme Court in 1838. The case was considered to end Indian slavery in Missouri. Throughout their struggle, Marguerite and her two sisters argued that their mother Marie Jean Scypion had been held illegally as a slave after 1769, because, after the Spanish started ruling the area, the colonial governor abolished Indian slavery in the Louisiana Territory to make regional policy consistent with other Spanish colonies. Since her mother was Natchez, Marie Jean Scypion was legally free. Thus her descendants born after that date were also free, as they were born to a free mother. Although an 1806 ruling in the Louisiana territorial supreme court went against the Scypion descendants, they did not give up their desire for freedom. Following passage of a new law in 1824 protecting slaves' right to sue against illegal enslavement, the women and their children renewed their petitions. In 1826 Marguerite Scypion and her children, and her two sisters filed separate suits against their masters. One of the Scypion sisters and some of their descendants died before the cases were finally decided. The suits were combined by the court under the name of Marguerite (free woman of color) for the final trial. She and the other descendants of Marie Jean Scypion finally achieved freedom in 1836." ;

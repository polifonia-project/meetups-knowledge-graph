        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jenifer Yésica Martínez Fernández (Córdoba, Spain, October 13, 1985), known professionally as India Martínez, is a Spanish flamenco and pop singer. Her artistic name was made out by the first manager she had at the age of 17, when she signed her first record contract. Her first contact with flamenco was through the dance classes she received from Nieves Camacho in Córdoba at the age of 5. When she was 11 years old, she moved with her parents to Puerto de Roquetas de Mar (Almería), where a year later she began to sing and also started to be called \"La Niña del Puerto\". She was nominated to Latin Grammy Award for Best New Artist during Latin Grammy Awards of 2009. She won Premio Cadena Dial 2012 award for the album Trece Verdades certified gold.

He was born on 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1883 in , near Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk), former Russian Empire (now Ukraine), and died on 18 March 1970 in Moscow, Russia. He was an offspring of a renowned klezmorim's family. Pulver studied violin since early childhood, at first with his father; later on, he studied with his brother-in-law, a disciple of Czech violinist Otakar Sevcik. Pulver graduated from St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he studied violin and composition under A.K. Lyadov. Initially, he was a violinist and composer in a wandering Ukrainian theatre group. Later on, he was a symphonic concert-master and conductor, a founding member of the Stradivari Quartet. He was the musical director of the State Jewish Theatre in Moscow (the GOSET). Pulver was awarded the titles of People's Artist of RSFSR and Distinguished Arts Master of RSFSR." ;

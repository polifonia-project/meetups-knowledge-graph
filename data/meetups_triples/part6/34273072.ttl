        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Mitchell Bohart (September 28, 1913 â€“ February 1, 2007) was an American entomologist, university professor, and a member of the University of California, Davis Department of Entomology for more than 50 years. He taught courses in general entomology, insect systematics, and summer field courses in insect identification. From 1963 to 1967 he served as chair of the Department of Entomology for the University of California at Davis. In 1946 the Department of Entomology established a research-oriented insect collection, and Richard Bohart contributed research material in the Diptera, Hymenoptera and Strepsiptera. Bohart's interests in aculeate wasps resulted in one of the most comprehensive collections in the USA. His contributions to the Department of Entomology led to the dedication of the on campus Bohart Museum of Entomology, named after him in 1986." ;

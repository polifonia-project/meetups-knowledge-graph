He is currently based in Brooklyn. Moshe comes from a musical family. His paternal grandfather, Theodore Burnett (known professionally as \"Ted Barnett‚Äù) played tenor and alto saxophone with bands led by Lucky Millinder, Earl Bostic, Don Redman, Louis Armstrong, and others. Moshe's father, Theodore Burnett II, also played saxophone. \"The name Ras came when I was around the Rastafarian community and playing in some reggae bands,\" he said in a 2014 interview. \"Moshe is a name given to me when I was a little younger based on a religious conversion in the family.\"" ;

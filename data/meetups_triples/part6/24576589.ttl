He was a singer with great success in the 1960s and in the first half of the 1970s. He was married two times and had two sons: Wilson Simoninha and Max de Castro, both are artists today. He also had a daughter, named Patricia. Although relatively unknown outside of South America, two of his biggest hits were successfully covered by Sérgio Mendes-- \"País Tropical\" and \"Sá Marina\" (the latter as \"Pretty World\" with English lyrics by Marilyn and Alan Bergman)." ;

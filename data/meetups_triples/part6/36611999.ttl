He previously played in MLB for the Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets. Stroman is listed at 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), making him one of only six pitchers shorter than 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) to make a start at the MLB level in the 21st century. Stroman attended Duke University, and played college baseball for the Duke Blue Devils. He made his MLB debut with the Blue Jays in 2014. In 2017, he was the World Baseball Classic MVP. After the regular season, he won a 2017 Gold Glove Award. Stroman was named an All-Star in 2019, and the Blue Jays traded him to the Mets later in the 2019 season." ;

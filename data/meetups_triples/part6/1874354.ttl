        mtp:hasAbstract        "Amado Carrillo Fuentes (/fuˈɛntəs/; December 17, 1956 – July 7, 1997) was a Mexican drug lord who seized control of the Juárez Cartel after assassinating his boss Rafael Aguilar Guajardo. Amado Carrillo became known as \"El Señor de Los Cielos\" (\"The Lord of the Skies\"), because of the large fleet of jets he used to transport drugs. He was also known for laundering money via Colombia, to finance this fleet. He died in July 1997, in a Mexican hospital, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery to change his appearance. In his final days, Carrillo was being tracked by Mexican and U.S. authorities. Amado carillo Fuentes was assessed to be worth around $25 billion (about $40 billion by the present appraisals) at the hour of death. A Mexican drug ruler held onto control of the Juárez Cartel after killing his supervisor Rafael Aguilar Guajardo. Amado Carrillo got known as ‘The Lord of the Skies’ due to the massive armada of planes he used to ship drugs." ;

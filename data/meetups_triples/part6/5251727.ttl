        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gary V. Janetti (born March 22, 1966) is an American television writer, producer, and actor. He has written for Family Guy, and was an executive producer on Will and Grace. He co-created and wrote the British sitcom Vicious, which aired on ITV from 2013 to 2016. Janetti's Instagram page has gained international media attention primarily for a satirical characterization of Prince George and the child's imagined, and often catty, response to various photos and news stories about members of the British royal family. The page has more than 950,000 followers. Janetti produced a satire-animated sitcom version of Prince George called The Prince for HBO Max. He also provides the voice of Prince George. Janetti's first solo nonfiction book, Do You Mind If I Cancel? (Things That Still Annoy Me), was published in October 2019, and became a New York Times Best Seller. His second is Start Without Me (I'll Be There in a Minute)." ;

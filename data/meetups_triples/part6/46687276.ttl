        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrea Jarvis Hamilton (born in 1968) is a conceptual artist and fine-art photographer best known for her extensive series of photographic images of the ocean, natural phenomena and the Kelvin scale. Her work encompasses the long term, systematic collection of subjects within a strict conceptual framework, creating expansive archives. These are retrospectively organised according to common visual characteristics (movement, colour, light) into series which highlight certain themes: the nature of time and memory, climate change, colour theory and being. Her work also encompasses still life, long exposure, landscape and portraiture, street photography and landscape. Hamilton has been short-listed for several notable photography prizes including the 7th Julia Margaret Cameron Award for Women Photographers, Chantel Paulâ€™s Honorable Mention at The Centre for Fine Art Photography in Colorado, the 9th Arte Laguna Prize and the Judges Choice at the AOP Open Awards 2013." ;

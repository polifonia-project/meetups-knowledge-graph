        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeon Jung-kook (Korean: 전정국; born September 1, 1997), known mononymously as Jungkook (stylized as Jung Kook), is a South Korean singer. He is the youngest member and vocalist of the South Korean boy band BTS. Jungkook has released three solo tracks as part of BTS discography: \"Begin\" in 2016, \"Euphoria\" in 2018, and \"My Time\" in 2020, all of which have charted on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. He also sang the soundtrack for the BTS-based webtoon 7Fates: Chakho, titled \"Stay Alive\". In 2022, he was featured on the single \"Left and Right\" by American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth, which peaked at number 22 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Later that year, he became the first South Korean singer to release a song for the FIFA World Cup soundtrack, with \"Dreamers\", which he subsequently performed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony. Jungkook's tracks as a soloist have also seen success on Spotify charts, with \"Dreamers\", \"Stay Alive\", and \"Left and Right\" all breaking records as the highest-debuting songs by a Korean soloist on the Spotify Global chart." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Colby Daniel Lopez (born May 28, 1986) is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Seth Rollins (often referred to as Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins). Prior to signing with WWE, Lopez wrestled under the ring name Tyler Black for Ring of Honor (ROH) and was part of the Age of the Fall stable with Jimmy Jacobs. During his time in ROH he held the ROH World Championship once and the ROH World Tag Team Championship twice with Jacobs, and won the 2009 Survival of the Fittest tournament. Lopez also wrestled for various independent promotions including Full Impact Pro, where he was a one-time FIP World Heavyweight Champion, as well as Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, where he was a one-time PWG World Tag Team Champion, also with Jacobs. Lopez signed with WWE in 2010 and was sent to its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he was renamed Seth Rollins and became the inaugural FCW Grand Slam Champion. After WWE rebranded FCW into NXT, he became the inaugural NXT Champion. Lopez debuted on WWE's main roster at the 2012 Survivor Series as part of a faction called The Shield, alongside Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns. Rollins won his first main roster championship, the WWE Tag Team Championship, with Reigns. Rollins then went on to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, WWE Universal Championship, WWE Intercontinental Championship and the WWE United States Championship, making him the promotion's 29th Triple Crown Champion and 19th Grand Slam Champion, as well as the second wrestler to accomplish the latter twice under the revised 2015 format. He also won the 2014 Money in the Bank ladder match, the 2015 Slammy Award for Superstar of the Year and the 2019 men's Royal Rumble. In addition, he holds the record for most title reigns with the Raw Tag Team Championship, with six. Rollins has headlined numerous major pay-per-view events for WWE, including WrestleMania 31. Industry veteran Sting, who wrestled his final WWE match against Rollins, described him as the most talented professional wrestler who he has ever seen or worked with. Rollins was the cover star for the video game WWE 2K18, and was named the number one wrestler in the world by Pro Wrestling Illustrated's PWI 500 list in both 2015 and 2019. Rollins is the only wrestler to cash in a WWE Money in the Bank contract at a WrestleMania event, and is the only wrestler to have held all three of WWE's current top titles (WWE, Universal, and NXT Championships)." ;

Thomson represented the 1st District, encompassing all or portions of Atchison, Holt, Nodaway, and Worth counties in northwest Missouri. Previously this district was known as the 4th. However the 2010 U.S. Census led to redistricting and renumbering across Missouri. Having served in the Missouri House since first being elected in 2006, Thomson is term-limited from running again in 2014." ;

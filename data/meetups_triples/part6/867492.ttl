        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christy Nicole Turlington Burns (born January 2, 1969) is an American model and humanitarian. She represented Calvin Klein's Eternity campaign in 1989 and again in 2014, and also represents Maybelline. Turlington was named one of Glamour's Women of the Year in 2013, and, in 2014, was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. Turlington initially attracted fame in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a supermodel. Grace Coddington, the long-time creative director of American Vogue magazine, has described Turlington as \"the most beautiful woman in the world.\" In 2010, Turlington founded Every Mother Counts, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization devoted to making pregnancy and childbirth safe for every mother. Every Mother Counts informs, engages, and mobilizes new audiences to take action and raise funds that support maternal health programs around the world. It was founded after the completion of Turlington's documentary, No Woman, No Cry, a film about pregnant women and their caregivers in Tanzania, Bangladesh, Guatemala, and the United States. In 2013, Turlington directed the documentary film Every Mile, Every Mother, which explores Every Mother Counts' participation in long distance running to highlight distance from healthcare providers as barriers to women receiving quality care." ;

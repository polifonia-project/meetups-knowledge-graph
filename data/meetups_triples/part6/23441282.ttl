        mtp:hasAbstract        "Grace Ethel Knight (born 23 December 1955) is an English-born Australian vocalist, saxophone player and songwriter. During the 1980s she was a mainstay of Indie pop group Eurogliders which formed in Perth, Western Australia. Knight later became a solo jazz singer and musician based in Sydney. In 1984, Eurogliders released an Australian top ten album, This Island, which spawned their No. 2 hit single, \"Heaven (Must Be There)\". \"Heaven\" also peaked at No. 21 on the United States' Billboard Mainstream Rock charts and appeared on the Hot 100. The song, written by Eurogliders' guitarist, Bernie Lynch, and vocals by Knight, was their only hit in United States. Knight and Lynch married in 1985 but separated soon after. Another Australian top ten album, Absolutely, followed for Eurogliders in 1985, which provided three further local top ten singles, \"We Will Together\", \"The City of Soul\" and \"Can't Wait to See You\". Since Eurogliders disbanded in 1989, Knight has had a successful career as a jazz singer. Knight made a cameo appearance in the 1990 TV series Come In Spinner and sang on its soundtrack, Come in Spinner, recorded with jazz artist Vince Jones, which peaked at No. 4 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) albums charts. This launched a new career for Knight, with her first solo album, Stormy Weather, which peaked at No. 16 in 1991. Other solo albums followed, Gracious in 1993, Live in 1996 and Zeitgeist in 2000. Eurogliders briefly reformed with Lynch and Knight in 2005 to release two additional albums by 2007. Knight returned to her solo career and released Willow in 2008." ;

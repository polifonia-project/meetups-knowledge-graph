        mtp:hasAbstract        "Terry Craig Shannon (August 16, 1952 â€“ May 26, 2005) was an American information technology consultant, journalist and author. For over 30 years, he was involved in implementing PDP, VAX, and Alpha computers with their respective operating systems RSX, VAX/VMS, OpenVMS and Windows NT. He was a respected journalist and analyst, paying particular attention to Compaq and Hewlett-Packard after the merger of Digital Equipment Corporation and the high-performance computing (HPC) space, writing a series of newsletters. He has been credited with assigning Intel Corporation the nickname \"Chipzilla\". Terry Shannon participated and was a keynote speaker at DECUS (the Digital Equipment Corporation Users Society), the international users group of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), later known as Connect, and currently HP-Interex. He also spoke as an authority at other IT and HPC conferences, and was quoted by other authors as an authority on the subject." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christopher Colin Brunt (born 14 December 1984) is a Northern Irish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest West Bromwich Albion midfielders in the clubâ€™s history. A versatile player, Brunt has featured primarily as a left winger, but can also operate as a left back or attacking midfielder. Brunt started his career with Middlesbrough but did not manage to make an appearance in the first team. He joined Sheffield Wednesday in 2004 and amassed 153 appearances for the club before joining West Bromwich Albion in 2007, where he went on to appear over 400 times. Brunt earned 65 caps for the Northern Ireland national team between 2004 and 2017. He also represented his country at youth level. In March 2021, Brunt returned to West Bromwich Albion as an academy coach." ;

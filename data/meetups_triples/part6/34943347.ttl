        mtp:hasAbstract        "Addie Muljadi Sumaatmadja or better known as Addie MS (born in Jakarta, Indonesia on 7 October 1959) is an Indonesian conductor, producer and composer of Sundanese and Javanese descent. He currently directs the Twilite Orchestra, which he founded in 1991. Born in Jakarta to a tile factory owner, Addie became interested in music at an early age. By the age of 12 he was studying to play the piano, and during high school he became involved with several musical projects. After failing to finish his university studies, Addie focused entirely on music. His first forays were into pop music, but in 1991 he abandoned the genre for classical music by dedicating himself entirely to his new orchestra. Since then, he has continued to conduct Twilite Orchestra, although he occasionally ventures into film soundtracks and pop songs." ;

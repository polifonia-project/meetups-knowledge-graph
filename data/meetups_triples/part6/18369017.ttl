He became CEO of Activision in 1991 after purchasing a company stake the previous year.

He has also served on several boards, including The Coca-Cola Company from 2012 to 2022, Yahoo from 2003 to 2008, and the Call of Duty Endowment (CODE), which he co-founded in 2009 and continues to retain his position on." ;

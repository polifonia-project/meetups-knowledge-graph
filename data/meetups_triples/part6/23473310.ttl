        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elizabeth Eaton Converse (born August 3, 1924, disappeared August 1974), known professionally as Connie Converse, was an American singer-songwriter and musician, active in New York City in the 1950s. Her work is among the earliest known recordings in the singer-songwriter genre of music. Converse left her family home in 1974 in search of a new life and was not heard from again. Her music was largely unknown until it was featured on a 2004 radio show. In March 2009, a compilation album of her work, How Sad, How Lovely, was released." ;

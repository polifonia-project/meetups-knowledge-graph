A member of the Democratic Party, he is in his 15th term in Congress. He was originally elected to represent the state's 17th congressional district (1992–1993), which was renumbered the 8th congressional district (1993–2013) and now is the 10th congressional district. Nadler has chaired the House Judiciary Committee since 2019. The 10th congressional district includes Manhattan's west side, from the Upper West Side down to Battery Park, including the World Trade Center; the Manhattan neighborhoods of Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen, and Greenwich Village; and parts of Brooklyn, such as Coney Island, Bensonhurst, Borough Park, and Bay Ridge. It includes many of New York City's most popular tourist attractions, including the Statue of Liberty, New York Stock Exchange, Brooklyn Bridge, and Central Park.

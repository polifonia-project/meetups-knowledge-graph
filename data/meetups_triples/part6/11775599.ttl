        mtp:hasAbstract        "Debashish Bhattacharya (Bengali: দেবাশীষ ভট্টাচার্য, Hindi: देवाशीष भट्टाचार्य, Devāśiṣ Bhaṭṭācārya, born 12 January 1963) is an Indian classical musician, singer, composer and educator. He is said to have introduced the first Slide Guitar Syllabus in the world. Bhattacharya redefined Indian classical music on slide guitar through the introduction of a new playing technique and sound, as well as a blending of traditional and uniquely contemporary approaches in designing his music. A music producer who plays lap slide guitar, he has taught more than a thousand students, created a new genre (Hindustani Slide Guitar), designed his own instruments (including the Chaturangui, Anandi and Gandharvi) and performed in more than two thousand concerts and workshops, with Grammy nominations and several world music awards.His latest guitar creation, the Pushpa Veena, is perhaps the first slide instrument in the world with a top made of animal skin.For Hindustani Raag music he has composed three new Raag, set to evening time: \"Raag Palāsh Priyā,\" \"Raag Shankar Dhwani\" and \"Raag Chandra Mālikā\"." ;

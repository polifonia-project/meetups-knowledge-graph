        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bob \"Slim\" Dunlap (born August 14, 1951) is an American rock musician. He is a Minnesota-based guitarist and singer-songwriter who is best known as a member of The Replacements from 1987 to 1991, replacing original lead guitarist Bob Stinson. Dunlap also recorded two solo albums in the mid-1990s. Dunlap was influenced by Hank Williams and Keith Richards, and has been called \"one of the last old-school cool guitar players\". Ralph Heibutzki at AllMusic said that he \"epitomizes the journeyman musician who plays for the fun of it, when his day gig allows\"." ;

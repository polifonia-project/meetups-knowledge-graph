During a playing career of 18 years, Collins played for many sides across England, Ireland and Northern Ireland. While towards the end of his career he became a joint-manager and player, Collins eventually turned his hand entirely to management. He managed Bohemians, the side he started his career at and played for during four spells throughout his career, before moving to England to manage Carlisle. After several successful spells in Ireland and one in Malta, Collins is currently unemployed." ;

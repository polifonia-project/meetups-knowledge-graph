        mtp:hasAbstract        "Puma King (born July 6, 1990) is a Mexican Luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler currently working with Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), but also as a freelancer in many Mexican promotions such as Lucha Memes, MexaWrestling and many more. He is best known for his time working for the Mexico City-based professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). Puma frequently teams with his brother, luchador Tiger. Puma's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. He is part of the Casas wrestling family, son of El Felino, using a ring character and a mask very similar to his father and has been trained by his uncle, professional wrestler Negro Casas." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Fernando Otero (born 1 May 1972) is a Grammy-award-winning Argentine pianist, vocalist, and composer. His first contact with music was receiving vocal lessons from his mother Elsa Marval, an internationally acclaimed singer and actress. He started taking piano lessons at five. He also studied the guitar, drums, accordion, and melodica, instruments he plays occasionally. A classically trained and virtuoso pianist, Otero studied classical music since childhood. He has since developed his own style which has elements of jazz, tango, and contemporary classical music." ;

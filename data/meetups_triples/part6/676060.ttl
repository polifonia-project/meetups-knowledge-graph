        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edward Macdonald Carey (March 15, 1913 â€“ March 21, 1994) was an American actor, best known for his role as the patriarch Dr. Tom Horton on NBC's soap opera Days of Our Lives. For almost three decades, he was the show's central cast member. He first made his career starring in various B-movies of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s (with a few A-picture exceptions like Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt). He was known in many Hollywood circles as \"King of the Bs\", sharing the throne with his \"queen\", Lucille Ball." ;

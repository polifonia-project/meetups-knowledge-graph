        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donald Scott Drysdale (July 23, 1936 – July 3, 1993) was an American professional baseball player and television sports commentator. A right-handed pitcher for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers for his entire career in Major League Baseball, Drysdale was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984. Drysdale won the 1962 Cy Young Award and in 1968 pitched a record six consecutive shutouts and 58+2⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings. One of the most dominant pitchers of the late 1950s to mid 1960s, Drysdale stood 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall and was not afraid to throw pitches near batters to keep them off balance. After his playing career, he became a radio/television broadcaster." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clinton Conger Ballard Jr. (May 24, 1931 â€“ December 23, 2008) was an American songwriter, singer, and pianist. He wrote two Billboard Hot 100 number one hits. The first was \"Game of Love\" by Wayne Fontana and The Mindbenders in 1965. The second was the 1975 hit, \"You're No Good\" by Linda Ronstadt (first sung by Dee Dee Warwick, covered by The Swinging Blue Jeans and later recorded by Van Halen). He wrote two UK number one singles, recorded by Jimmy Jones (\"Good Timin'\", 1960) and The Hollies (\"I'm Alive\", 1965). Ballard also pursued a solo singing career. With minor success he recorded under his own name, as well as under the pseudonym Buddy Clinton." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frank Huntington Stack (born October 31, 1937 in Houston, Texas) is an American underground cartoonist and fine artist. Working under the name Foolbert Sturgeon to avoid persecution for his work while living in the Bible Belt, Stack published what is considered by many to be the first underground comic, The Adventures of Jesus, in 1964. Stack's main artistic influences were Gustave Dor√©, Roy Crane, and V. T. Hamlin. He is widely known as a printmaker, specializing in etchings and lithographs, and his sketchy comics style evokes Stack's background as an etcher. (His technique of creating etchings on-site was featured in American Artist magazine.) His oil paintings and watercolors mostly feature landscape and figure compositions. He lives in Columbia, Missouri where he was a longtime professor at the University of Missouri." ;

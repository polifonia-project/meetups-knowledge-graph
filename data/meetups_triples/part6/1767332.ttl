        mtp:hasAbstract        "Barry Truax (born 1947) is a Canadian composer who specializes in real-time implementations of granular synthesis, often of sampled sounds, and soundscapes. He is credited with developing the first ever implementation of real-time granular synthesis in 1986, with being the first composer to explore the range between synchronic and asynchronic granular synthesis in Riverrun (1986), and being the first to use a sample as the source of a granular composition in Wings of Nike (1987). Truax is Professor Emeritus of Simon Fraser University, where he taught both electroacoustic music and acoustic communication. He was one of the original members of the World Soundscape Project." ;

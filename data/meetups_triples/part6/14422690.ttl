        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jean-Jacques Birgé (born 5 November 1952) is an independent French musician and filmmaker, at once music composer (co-founder of Un Drame Musical Instantané with which he records about 30 albums, as well as for movies, theater, dance, radio), film director (La nuit du phoque, Sarajevo a Street Under Siege, The Sniper), multimedia author (Carton, Machiavel, Alphabet), sound designer (exhibitions, CD-Roms, websites, Nabaztag, etc.), founder of record label GRRR. Specialist of the relations between sound and pictures, he has been one of the early synthesizer players and home studio creators in France in 1973, and with Un d.m.i. the initiator of the return of silent movies with live orchestra in 1976. His records show the use of samplers since 1980 and computers since 1985. Since 1995, this polymath has become a sound designer in all multimedia areas and interactive composition. Hardly classifiable musically, he may be likened to the encyclopedist current, such as Charles Ives, İlhan Mimaroğlu, Frank Zappa, René Lussier, Francois Sarhan, Jonathan Pontier, Jim O'Rourke or John Zorn who are mostly self-taught composers. His compositions follow cinematographic syntax more than the laws of harmony and counterpoint! He has been writing a daily blog since 2005, actually on Mediapart, with more than 5000 articles." ;

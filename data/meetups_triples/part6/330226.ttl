        mtp:hasAbstract        "Karolina Gočeva (Macedonian: Каролина Гочева, pronounced [ karɔˈlina ˈɡɔtʃɛva]; born 28 April 1980), sometimes credited as Karolina Gocheva or known only as Karolina, is a Macedonian pop singer. Gočeva launched her music career in 1991 with a performance at a local children's show and continued participating in the following years, receiving recognition for her talent. In 1992, she released her first children album titled Mamo, pušti me (English: Mom, let me go). After several years of participating at the Skopje Fest, the Macedonian regional show for a song selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, she signed a contract with the record label Avalon Production in 2000. Gočeva's discography consists of a total of nine studio albums, spanning pop, R&B rock, traditional folk and ethno, jazz and world musical styles. Shortly after signing her contract with Avalon Production, Gočeva released her debut studio album Jas Imam Pesna which included the song \"Nemir\" featuring Toše Proeski. Her second, third and fourth studio albums Zošto Sonot Ima Kraj, Znaeš Kolku Vredam and Vo Zaborav were released in 2002, 2003 and 2005, respectively. While her initial five albums were more pop-, R&B-, and rock-oriented, her later records Makedonsko Devojče (English: Macedonian Girl) (2008), Makedonsko Devojče 2 (2014) and Izvor (English: Spring) (2018) incorporated elements of Macedonian traditional music and jazz. This switch in sound led to increased popularity, wide acclaim from the public, and sold-out concerts in North Macedonia, Serbia and Bulgaria. Her ninth studio album, in collaboration with Duke Bojadziev and Ismail Lumanovski, Pesni za Ljubov i Kopnež is expected for release on 23 December 2022. She represented Macedonia in the Eurovision Song Contests 2002 and 2007, ranking 19th and 14th, respectively. Gočeva has received numerous awards and accolades both in North Macedonia as well as other Balkan award ceremonies. She is widely known as the most famous Macedonian female pop singer and has received the label \"Macedonian pop princess/queen\" and a \"pop diva\". Although most of her songs are sung in Macedonian, Gočeva has also released records in Serbo-Croatian and English leading to an increase in popularity in Bulgaria and ex-Yugoslav countries such as Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Croatia. Additionally, Gočeva is renowned for her casual fashion style for which she frequently collaborates with Caci Pakoska. With her music work, Gočeva has also taken part in campaigns against drug use and uterine cancer." ;

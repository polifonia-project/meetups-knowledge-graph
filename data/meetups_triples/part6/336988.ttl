        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter John Gzowski CC (July 13, 1934 â€“ January 24, 2002), known colloquially as \"Mr. Canada\", or \"Captain Canada\", was a Canadian broadcaster, writer and reporter, most famous for his work on the CBC radio shows This Country in the Morning and Morningside. His first biographer argued that Gzowski's contribution to Canadian media must be considered in the context of efforts by a generation of Canadian nationalists to understand and express Canada's cultural identity. Gzowski wrote books, hosted television shows, and worked at a number of newspapers and at Maclean's magazine. Gzowski was known for a friendly, warm, interviewing style." ;

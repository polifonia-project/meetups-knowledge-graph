        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hsieh Su-wei (Chinese: 謝淑薇; pinyin: Xiè Shūwēi (Taiwan); Taiwanese Mandarin: [ɕjê sǔ wěi]; born 4 January 1986) is an inactive Taiwanese professional tennis player. She has won three singles titles and 30 doubles titles on the WTA Tour, one WTA 125 doubles title, 27 singles and 23 doubles titles on the ITF Circuit, seven medals at the Asian Games (2 gold, 3 silver, and 2 bronze), 1 gold and bronze medal at the 2005 Summer Universiade, and has amassed over $10 million in prize money. On 25 February 2013, she reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 23, and on 12 May 2014, she reached world No. 1 in the doubles rankings for the first time; she has spent a total of 47 weeks with the top ranking, the longest tenure by a tennis player from the Far East. Hsieh is the highest-ranked Taiwanese player in history, in both singles and doubles. Known for playing with two hands on both sides, flat and quick groundstrokes, crafty gameplay, aggressive volleys, and unorthodox variety of shots, Hsieh is regarded as one of the most successful and versatile doubles players in history. She has won four Grand Slam titles in doubles, claiming the 2013 Wimbledon Championships and the 2014 French Open with Peng Shuai (with whom she also won the 2013 WTA Championships), the 2019 Wimbledon Championships with Barbora Strýcová, and the 2021 Wimbledon Championships with Elise Mertens. Hsieh and Strýcová also were the runners-up at both the 2019 WTA Finals and the 2020 Australian Open. She also reached the quarterfinals in doubles at the 2012 London Olympics with compatriot Chuang Chia-jung. Though Hsieh has yet to win a Grand Slam on hardcourts, most of her titles have come on hardcourts, including seven of her WTA 1000 titles. While primarily known for her doubles prowess, Hsieh has also found success on the singles tour. Most of her singles success has come on hardcourts, where she has won all three of her WTA Tour titles, as well as reached the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in 2021, a Premier 5 semifinal at Dubai in 2019, and a Premier Mandatory quarterfinal at the Miami Open in 2019 (defeating world No. 1 Naomi Osaka in the third round). She has also been successful on other surfaces, including reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2018 (defeating world No. 1, Simona Halep in the third round) and the third round of the French Open in 2017. Hsieh has recorded singles victories over several top 15, top 10 and top 5 players. Hsieh is one of two active female players with over 500 career wins in both singles and doubles, the other being Lucie Hradecká. She is also the first Taiwanese female player to reach a Grand Slam singles quarterfinal, achieved at the 2021 Australian Open. At 35, she became the oldest debutante Grand Slam quarterfinalist." ;

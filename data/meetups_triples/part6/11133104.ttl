        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dennis (Denus) McGee (born January 26, 1893, Eunice, Louisiana, USA – October 3, 1989) was one of the earliest recorded Cajun musicians. A fiddle player, he recorded and performed with Creole accordionist and vocalist Amédé Ardoin, with accordionist , and with fiddlers Sady Courville (McGee's brother-in-law) and . The recordings with Courville and Frugé are among the few surviving examples of Cajun music as it existed before the influence of the accordion became prominent. McGee's repertoire included not only the waltz and the common to Cajun music but also such dances as the one-step, polka, mazurka, reel, cotillion, the varsovienne, and others." ;

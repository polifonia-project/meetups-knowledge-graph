        mtp:hasAbstract        "Camille François Sauvageau (12 May 1861 – 5 August 1936) was a French botanist and phycologist. Sauvageau was born in Angers. He studied at the University of Montpellier, receiving his degree in natural sciences in 1884. Afterwards he served as an assistant to Charles Flahault (1884–88) in Montpellier and to Philippe Van Tieghem (1885–91) in Paris. In 1891 he received his doctorate in Paris with the thesis \"Sur les feuilles de quelques Monocotylédones aquatiques\" (On the leaves of some aquatic monocots). In 1892 he attained a professorship at the University of Lyon, later serving as a professor of botany at the Faculty of Sciences of Bordeaux (1901–32). He is known for his investigations of Phaeophyceae, being a taxonomic authority of numerous brown algae species. In 1926 he described the order Sporochnales. His name was lent to the mycological genus Sauvageautia Har., 1892 (now a synonym of Urosporella G.F.Atkinson, 1897) as well as to the algae genus Sauvageaugloia (Hamel ex Kylin, 1940). The French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Prix Montagne for 1904." ;

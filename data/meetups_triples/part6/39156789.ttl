        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dzhokhar \"Jahar\" Anzorovich Tsarnaev born July 22, 1993) is a Kyrgyz-American man of Chechen descent, convicted of terrorism. Tsarnaev was convicted of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombing by planting pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the race on April 15, 2013, along with his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The bombings killed three people and injured approximately 280 others. Tsarnaev and his family had traveled to the United States on a tourist visa and subsequently claimed asylum during their stay in 2002. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012. At the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev was a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Previously, Tsarnaev had attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. Following the bombings, on April 18, the Tsarnaev brothers shot and killed MIT Police Officer Sean Collier in a failed attempt to steal his firearm. Later that night, they engaged in a shootout with the police. Tamerlan was killed and a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police officer was critically injured in the course of the escape in an SUV. Dzhokhar was injured but escaped, and a manhunt ensued, with thousands of police searching a 20-block area of Watertown, Massachusetts. On the evening of April 19, Tsarnaev was found seriously wounded and unarmed hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown just outside the police perimeter. After the police opened fire at the boat, they arrested him and took him to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Tsarnaev was charged on April 22 with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death. Tsarnaev later said during questioning that the brothers next intended to detonate explosives in Times Square in New York City. Tsarnaev reportedly also told authorities that he and his brother were inspired, at least in part, by watching lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki. He was convicted on April 8, 2015 and sentenced to death on June 24, 2015. His death sentence was vacated on appeal in July 2020, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed this decision in March 2022." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jakob Luke Dylan (born December 9, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter. He rose to fame as the lead singer and primary songwriter for the rock band the Wallflowers. Born in New York City to musician Bob Dylan and model Sara Lownds, Dylan began his music career in various indie bands before creating the Wallflowers in 1989. As part of that group, he has written hit songs such as \"6th Avenue Heartache\" and \"One Headlight\", which is listed at number 58 on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Pop Songs\", and for which he won two Grammy Awards. More recently, Dylan has released two solo albums: Seeing Things (2008) and Women + Country (2010). The latter became Dylan's highest-charting album since the Wallflowers' 1996 breakthrough Bringing Down the Horse, peaking at number 12 on the Billboard 200." ;

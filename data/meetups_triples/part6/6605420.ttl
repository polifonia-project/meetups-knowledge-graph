He later became the president of Myspace and a strategic adviser for the company. Due to the long-running practise of his profile being automatically added as the first \"friend\" of new Myspace users upon the creation of their profiles, he is popularly known as \"Tom from Myspace\", \"Myspace Tom\", or \"my friend Tom\"." ;

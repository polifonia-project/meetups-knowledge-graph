        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maia Estianty (born 27 January 1976), known as Maia Ahmad during her marriage to fellow musician Ahmad Dhani, is an Indonesian singer and television personality. Estianty was born in Surabaya, and showed interest in music at an early age, winning a marching band competition while still in elementary school. She began training as a disc jockey while still in junior high school. After studying at University of Indonesia, Estianty joined Dewa 19 as a backing vocalist. In 1999, she and Dhani came up with the idea for the musical duo Ratu. Estianty played the music, while other women – first Pinkan Mambo, then Mulan Kwok – sang. Ratu was highly successful. After the dissolution of the band in 2007 and bitter divorce in September 2008, Estianty formed Duo Maia with Mey Chan. She is currently focusing on producing music with her label, Le Moesik." ;

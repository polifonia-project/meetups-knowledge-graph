        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Allen Johnson (born January 30, 1943) is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He played as a second baseman from 1965 through 1978, most notably as a member of the Baltimore Orioles dynasty that won four American League pennants and two World Series championships between 1966 and 1971. Johnson played in Major League Baseball from 1965 to 1975, then played for two seasons in the Nippon Professional Baseball league before returning to play in Major League Baseball with the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs from 1977 to 1978. A three-time Rawlings Gold Glove Award winner, he was selected to four All-Star Game teams during his playing career. After retiring as a player, Johnson became a successful manager. He led the New York Mets to the 1986 World Series title, and to an additional National League East title in 1988. He won the American League's Manager of the Year Award in 1997 when he led the Baltimore Orioles wire-to-wire to the American League East division championship. He won the same award in the National League in 2012 when he led the Washington Nationals to the franchise's first division title since moving to Washington, D.C., and their first overall since 1981. Johnson managed teams to their respective League Championship Series in three consecutive years â€“ the Cincinnati Reds in 1995 and the Orioles in both 1996 and 1997. He also managed the Los Angeles Dodgers." ;

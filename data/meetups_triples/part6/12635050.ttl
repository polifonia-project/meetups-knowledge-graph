        mtp:hasAbstract        "Holly Rene Holm (born October 17, 1981) is an American mixed martial artist, who competes in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. She is the former UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion, and a former professional boxer and kickboxer. She was a multiple-time world champion in boxing, defending her titles 18 times in three weight classes, and a two-time Ring magazine fighter of the year (2005, 2006). She is ranked by BoxRec as the best female professional boxer of all time. She has the notable distinction of being the first (and currently only) fighter to hold a world-boxing title and a UFC title. Holm's most notable win in mixed martial arts (MMA) occurred at UFC 193 (November 15, 2015), in front of a record-breaking crowd for a UFC event (56,215 people) in Melbourne, when she captured the bantamweight title and gave Ronda Rousey her first loss in the sport. This fight is generally considered to be one of the biggest upsets in combat-sports history. As of May 23, 2022, she is ranked #3 in the UFC women's bantamweight rankings, and as of November 21, 2022, she is #10 in the UFC women's pound-for-pound rankings." ;

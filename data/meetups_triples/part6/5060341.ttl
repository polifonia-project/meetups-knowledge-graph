        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jörg Buttgereit (born 20 December 1963) is a German writer/director known for his controversial films. He was born in Berlin, Germany, and has lived there his entire life. He is best known for his horror films Nekromantik (1987), Der Todesking (1990), Nekromantik 2 (1991) and Schramm (1993). In 1999, he directed an episode of the television series Lexx, after a six-year absence from the entertainment industry. In 2013, Buttgereit announced that he would be teaming up with fellow horror directors Andreas Marschall and Michal Kosakowski to work on an anthology film called German Angst, in which each director would do one short. The film was released on May 7, 2015. Buttgereit's superhero character, Captain Berlin, was adapted into a comic book series in 2013. There is also a comic book version of Nekromantik." ;

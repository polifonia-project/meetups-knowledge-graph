        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nina Cassian (pen name of Renée Annie Cassian-Mătăsaru; * 27 November 1924, Galați – 14 April 2014, New York City) was a Romanian poet, children's book writer, translator, journalist, accomplished pianist and composer, and film critic. She spent the first sixty years of her life in Romania until she moved to the United States in 1985 for a teaching job. A few years later Cassian was granted permanent asylum and New York City became her home for the rest of her life. Much of her work was published both in Romanian and in English." ;

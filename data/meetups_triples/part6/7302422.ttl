She represented Spain at the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest. Remedios Amaya has been popular with international audiences since the debut of her first self-titled album in '78. Her first album, the self-titled Remedios Amaya, was published in 1978. In 1983 she was internally selected by Televisión Española to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983 in Munich. She scored nul points with the song \"¿Quién maneja mi barca?\". Amaya's first works, Luna nueva (1983) and Seda en mi piel (1984), were an example of flamenco-rock.

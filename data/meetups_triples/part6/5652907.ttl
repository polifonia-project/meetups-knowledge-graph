Adams was born in Glasgow, and married Irene Adams on 24 February 1968. He was elected as a Member of Strathclyde Regional Council for Paisley Craigielea in 1974, a position he held until standing down due to his election as the MP for Paisley. He served as Labour's Scottish whip whilst an MP. In a notable speech on 31 March 1988, he described Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons as having \"behaved towards Scotland with all the sensitivity of a sex-starved boa constrictor\", a remark immediately withdrawn, as is the custom in the Commons." ;

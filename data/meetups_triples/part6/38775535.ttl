He is known for his extensive scholarship on the history and meaning of the thought of Karl Marx. Draper was a lifelong advocate of what he called \"socialism from below\", that is, self-emancipation by the working class, in opposition to capitalism and Stalinist bureaucracy. He was one of the creators of the Third Camp tradition, a form of Marxist socialism." ;

In 2010, he released his debut solo album, Warm Is Your Color, which had a top-ten song hit on Sirius XM's The Coffee House radio station.

On September 9, 2014, he released the EP Staring at My Ceiling in the Dark. Driver tours and records as part of The Nick Driver Band, which has appeared at festivals such as FloydFest.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Frank Andrews (born 20 May 1951) is an Australian Christian anarchist author, speaker, social activist, community worker, and a founder of the Waiters' Union, an inner city Christian community network working with Aboriginals, refugees and people with disabilities in Brisbane, Australia. In India at the time of Indira Gandhi's 1984 assassination, he helped protect Sikhs from the backlash through non-violent intervention. Andrews and his wife were forced to leave that year. Andrew works to advance Christian-Muslim relations, quotes Islamic leaders, and counts many Muslims as colleagues. He released a statement of regret when Maulana Wahiduddin Khan died in Delhi in April 2021 of COVID-19." ;

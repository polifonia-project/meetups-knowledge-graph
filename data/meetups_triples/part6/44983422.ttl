        mtp:hasAbstract        "Manuel Godoy y Álvarez de Faria, Prince of the Peace, 1st Duke of Alcudia, 1st Duke of Sueca, 1st Baron of Mascalbó (12 May 1767 – 4 October 1851) was First Secretary of State of Spain from 1792 to 1797 and from 1801 to 1808. He received many titles, including that of príncipe de la Paz ('Prince of the Peace'), by which he is widely known. Godoy is best known for his diplomacy with Napoleon. In 1804 Godoy was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Godoy came to power at a young age as the favourite of King Charles IV and Queen Maria Luisa. Despite multiple disasters, Godoy maintained power. Many Spanish leaders blamed him for the disastrous war with Britain that cut off the Spanish Empire and ruined its finances. Crown Prince Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias, led an attempt to oust Godoy in 1807. Godoy's unpopularity culminated in the Tumult of Aranjuez in March 1808, which forced him into exile." ;

During his musical career he was signed to Al Khouyoul Records and from 2003 onwards with Rotana Records. In 2013 and after an illustrious career as a singer, Fadel Chaker joined the ranks of imam-turned-terrorist Ahmed al-Assir and participated in the attacks on the Lebanese army which later evolved into the 2013 Sidon clash. As of 2013, he is a wanted fugitive by the Lebanese government and has hidden in Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp. On 16 December 2020, he was sentenced in absentia to a total of 22 years of imprisonment and hard labour by a Lebanese Military Tribunal." ;

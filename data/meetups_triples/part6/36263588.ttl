Although retired, Aarseth is still an active researcher. He has dedicated his career to the development of N-body codes. He is the author of the NBODY family of codes, the current iteration is NBODY7. His current areas of research include the effects of stellar evolution in N-body codes, the influence of black holes on stellar systems, the evolution of globular clusters, and the use of GPUs to increase the speed of his codes. Aarseth was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1986-87. He was awarded the 1998 Brouwer Award for his work on advancing dynamical astronomy. The asteroid 9836 Aarseth is named in his honour. Outside of research, Aarseth's interests include mountaineering, trekking and wildlife.

Born 30 May 1900 in the Smallthorne area of Stoke-on-Trent and he started work aged 14 on the railway. He continued as a clerk at the railway until he was elected at the 1945 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Burslem division of Stoke-on-Trent. The Burslem seat was abolished for the 1950 general election, when Davies was re-elected for the new Stoke-on-Trent North constituency, and held that seat until his death in 1953. Davies was on his way to Jamaica as member of a delegation from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association on board the SS Bayano when he died, aged 52, and was buried at sea." ;

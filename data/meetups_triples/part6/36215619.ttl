Randall's work normally finds its way into boutique hotels, restaurants and private residences as well as the clothing brand Ted Baker. She has designed much of their bespoke lighting pieces for their international stores. In 2008 Randall started working in the controversial medium of taxidermy She took the ethical stance to work only with already dead or culled animals and so has worked a lot with vermin.

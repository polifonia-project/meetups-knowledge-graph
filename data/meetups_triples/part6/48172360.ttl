        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nicole Ann Bell (born September 8, 1991), known professionally as Nicole Dollanganger, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and artist. Dollanganger's music is characterized by a feminine, high-pitched vocal style, minimal instrumentation, and lyrical themes frequently pertaining to true crime, sexuality, and romance. Her music has been described as \"lo-fi\", \"atmospheric\", and \"bedroom folk\", is associated with the folk music, folk pop, bedroom pop, sadcore and dream pop genres. In 2015, Rolling Stone named Dollanganger in an article titled \"10 New Artists You Need to Know\", stating that her \"gothic folk songs\" described as \"macabre millennial nightmares, softened by dream-pop tranquilizers, reverberating from a casket-shaped music box\", are \"as beautiful as they are brutal.\" Her stage name comes from the Dollanganger Series of novels by V. C. Andrews." ;

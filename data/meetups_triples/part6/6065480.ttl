He holds B.M., M.M., and D.M.A. degrees from the Juilliard School, where he studied composition with Elliott Carter and Vincent Persichetti. He also has studied composition with Peter Maxwell Davies and conducting with Harold Farberman and Gennady Rozhdestvensky. His music has been commissioned by the Emerson Quartet, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the San Francisco Symphony, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra; additional ensembles that have performed his works include the Arditti Quartet, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Hong Kong Sinfonietta, and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. A theatrical work, the chamber opera Marrying the Hangman (1999), is on a text by Margaret Atwood and was written for the Psappha New Music Ensemble. Caltabiano has received awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, Broadcast Music, Inc.

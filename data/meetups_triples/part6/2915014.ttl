He was a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1901 to 1914. The year after his retirement, he became a manager, and he led two teams to their first-ever modern-era National League championships: the 1915 Philadelphia Phillies and the 1919 Cincinnati Reds. Moran was the first manager to win National League pennants with two different teams. Moran's 1919 Reds also captured their first World Series championship." ;

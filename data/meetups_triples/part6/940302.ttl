        mtp:hasAbstract        "Juhani Juice Leskinen (officially Pauli Matti Juhani \"Juice\" Leskinen; 19 February 1950 – 24 November 2006), better known as Juice Leskinen (pronounced [ˈjui̯se ˈleskinen] as if the word juice were Finnish) was one of the most important and successful Finnish singer-songwriters of the late 20th century. From the early 1970s onward he released nearly 30 full-length albums and wrote song lyrics for dozens of other Finnish artists. Several of Leskinen's songs have reached classic status in Finnish popular music, e.g., \"Viidestoista yö\", \"Kaksoiselämää\" and \"Syksyn sävel\". His early records are considered staples of the so-called Manserock movement of the mid-'70s. He also wrote poetry and plays and published nine collections of verse and seven plays. After moving to Tampere to study English translation in 1970, Leskinen began his recording career in 1973 with the eponymous debut album of Juice Leskinen & Coitus Int. One more record, Per Vers, runoilija, was made under the same band name, but from then on he released records with several line-ups, most notably Juice Leskinen Slam and Juice Leskinen Grand Slam from the late 1970s until the mid 1980s. Although concentrating more on poetry from the early 1990s, Leskinen still released new music every few years despite his failing health, which was caused by the unhealthy lifestyle he had led for years. After the longest hiatus of his recording career, L marked Leskinen's 50th birthday in 2000. His last record, Senaattori ja boheemi (released in 2004), is a collaboration with Mikko Alatalo, a return to their partnership of the early 1970s. He wrote \"Nuku pommiin\" in 1982 for the Eurovision Song Contest. Juice Leskinen's most famous songs include \"Viidestoista yö\" (\"Fifteenth Night\"), \"Musta aurinko nousee\" (\"A Sun Rises in Me\", often misunderstood as \"The Black Sun Rises\" despite a clear pause between \"musta\" and \"aurinko\"), \"Marilyn\", \"Rakkauden ammattilainen\" (\"Love Pro\"), \"Norjalainen villapaita\" (\"Norwegian Sweater\") and \"Kaksoiselämää\" (Double Life). Leskinen was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome in the early 2000s. He qualified 38th in the poll of the 100 greatest Finns held during the summer of 2004. Leskinen died in 2006 after suffering from chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis and diabetes. He is buried in Kalevankangas cemetery, Tampere, near the main gate. Leskinen has gained a considerable amount of posthumous recognition. A musical about Leskinen, titled Juice – taiteilijaelämää (an artist's life) premiered in Tampere on 30 August 2011.In 2015, two film companies announced plans for biography films. One of them was cancelled.In 2014 a biography of Leskinen was published, written by Antti Heikkinen, and named Risainen elämä. Juice Leskinen 1950–2006." ;

Sebastian Kawa is a second-generation glider pilot, together with his father Tomasz Kawa (an accomplished competition pilot as well) associated with the Mountain Gliding School \"Żar\" in southern Poland. In his youth, before becoming a pilot, Sebastian Kawa was a competitive sailor in Cadet, Optimist and 420 class, with multiple titles in national championships and participation in top level European and world events. He is also (like his parents) a qualified physician, working at the General Hospital in Bielsko-Biała. Sebastian is also known in the Polish gliding community for numerous Web writings and films popularizing the sport. His autobiography and advanced gliding tutorial Sky Full of Heat (English and Polish language editions) was published in December 2012." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 â€“ 15 December 2011) was an American-British author and journalist who wrote or edited over 30 books (including five essay collections) on culture, politics, and literature. Born and educated in England, Hitchens worked as a journalist with the New Statesman magazine in London in the 1970s after leaving Oxford. In the early 1980s he emigrated to the United States and wrote for The Nation and Vanity Fair. Hitchens political views evolved greatly throughout his life. Originally describing himself as a democratic socialist, he was a member of various socialist organisations in his early life, including the International Socialists. Hitchens eventually no longer regarded himself as socialist, but continued to admire aspects of Marxism, particularly its materialist view of history. He was critical of aspects of American foreign policy, including its involvement in Vietnam, Chile, and East Timor. However, he also supported the United States in the Kosovo War. After Hitchens disenchantment with Marxism, he emphasized the centrality of the American Revolution and Constitution to his political philosophy. Hitchens had complex views on abortion; being ethically opposed to it in most instances, and believing that a fetus was entitled to personhood, while holding ambigious, changing views on its legality. He supported LGBT rights, contraception access, gun rights, and opposed the War on Drugs. Beginning in the 1990s, and particularly after 9/11, his politics shifted to the right, advocating for the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, and endorsing the re-election campaign of George W. Bush in 2004, viewing Islamism as the principal threat to the Western World. Hitchens described himself as an anti-theist and saw all religions as false, harmful and authoritarian. He argued for free expression, scientific discovery, and the separation of church and state, arguing that they were superior to religion as an ethical code of conduct for human civilisation. The dictum \"What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence\" has become known as Hitchens's razor. Hitchens wrote critical biographies of Catholic nun Mother Teresa in The Missionary Position, President Bill Clinton in No One Left To Lie To, and American diplomat Henry Kissinger in The Trial of Henry Kissinger. Hitchens died from complications related to esophageal cancer in December 2011." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "The Happy Land fire was an act of arson that killed 87 people on March 25, 1990. The 87 victims were trapped in the unlicensed Happy Land social club, located at 1959 Southern Boulevard in the West Farms section of the Bronx in New York City, United States. Most of the victims were young Hondurans celebrating Easter, many of them part of the Garifuna American community. Cuban refugee Julio Gonz√°lez, whose former girlfriend was employed at the club, was arrested soon afterward and ultimately convicted of arson and murder. The fire was the deadliest in New York City since the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which coincidentally occurred on the same day in 1911, and the deadliest in American territory since the Dupont Plaza Hotel fire in Puerto Rico in 1986." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jesse Thomas Lacey (born July 10, 1978) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and record producer who is best known as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the American alternative rock band Brand New. He is known for his enigmatic and private nature, rarely giving interviews and describing himself as a perfectionist. Lacey was the founding bassist of fellow Long Island rock band Taking Back Sunday but left the band after a personal incident involving guitarist John Nolan. Along with members of the Rookie Lot, Lacey formed Brand New in 2000. With Brand New, Lacey earned a number-one album in the United States due to the commercial success of 2017's Science Fiction. As well as fronting Brand New, Lacey has performed as a solo artist since 2004, although has not yet released any solo material, and instead performs material by Brand New, as well as covering other bands. Lacey has produced and co-produced a number of records, including those Brand New, as well as Kevin Devine's Bubblegum and a track by Cymbals Eat Guitars." ;

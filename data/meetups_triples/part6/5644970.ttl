        mtp:hasAbstract        "Albert Pyun (May 19, 1953 – November 26, 2022) was an American film director who made low-budget B-movies and direct-to-video action films. The Independent Film Channel said that Pyun \"has carved out a unique niche as a director of low-budget, high-concept genre films starring actors past their prime\", adding that \"others believe this a charitable description for Pyun, who has also been derided as the new Ed Wood.\" Though his films frequently blended kickboxing and hybrid martial arts with science fiction and dystopic or post-apocalyptic themes, which often include cyborgs, Pyun stated in a 2012 interview that \"I have really no interest in cyborgs. And I've never really had any interest in post-apocalyptic stories or settings. It just seemed that those situations presented a way for me to make movies with very little money, and to explore ideas that I really wanted to explore — even if they were [controversial].\" Pyun's films include The Sword and the Sorcerer, Cyborg, Captain America, and Nemesis." ;

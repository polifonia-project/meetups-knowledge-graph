        mtp:hasAbstract        "Raymond Roger Miller (April 30, 1945 – May 4, 2021) was an American pitching coach and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). A highly regarded pitching coach, he was known for bringing improvement to the pitchers he coached at many stops over his career. His successes as a pitching coach twice led him to be promoted to manager, where he was much less successful. He managed the Minnesota Twins (1985–86) and the Baltimore Orioles (1998–99), each for less than two seasons and with a losing record each time, compiling an overall managerial record of 266–297 (.472)." ;

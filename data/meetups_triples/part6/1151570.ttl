        mtp:hasAbstract        "Garrett Robin Hamler, known professionally as Sean Garrett, is an American songwriter, record producer and R&B singer. He is responsible for a series of chart-topping compositions, most notably Usher's \"Yeah!\" which ranks second on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade for 2000–2009, and other songs written by him which include Ciara's breakout track \"Goodies\", Teairra Marí's debut single \"Make Her Feel Good\", Mario's single \"Break Up\", Nicki Minaj's first single \"Massive Attack\", The Pussycat Dolls' hit single \"Buttons\", and Britney Spears' \"Toy Soldier\". Garrett has produced eighteen number-one singles in seven years of producing music, putting him in fifth place on the Billboard list of producers with the most number-one hits. Garrett is the first producer to achieve this measure of success in under a decade since George Martin, who produced 20 number-one hits for The Beatles in 6+1⁄2 years from 1964 to 1970. He is also the only active hip hop producer that is mentioned on the Billboard list of producers with the most number-one hits. Garrett is in a production duo with Swizz Beatz, and together they produced several Beyoncé singles: \"Ring the Alarm\", \"Get Me Bodied\", \"Upgrade U\", \"Check on It\", \"Diva\", and \"Video Phone\". He also writes often over productions by Polow da Don and has been nominated for four Grammy Awards." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edin Dervišhalidović (Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic: Един Дервишхалидовић; born 12 September 1962), known professionally as Dino Merlin (Дино Мерлин), is a Bosnian singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. Born in Sarajevo, he was the founder and leader of Merlin, which eventually became one of the best-selling rock-bands of Southeast Europe. Nicknamed \"The Wizard\", he is considered one of the most prominent and commercially successful artists ever to emerge from former Yugoslavia. Dino is recognised for his later solo work, which established him as one of the best-selling regional artists of all time. Over the course of his career, he has produced over a dozen chart-topping albums, held several record-breaking tours, won many awards including the Sixth April Award of Sarajevo, and has authored the first national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is widely known for his distinctive voice, stage performances and poetic lyrics." ;

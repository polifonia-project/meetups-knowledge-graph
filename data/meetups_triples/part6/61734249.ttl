        mtp:hasAbstract        "Emeka Akumefule, known professionally as Blaqbonez, is a Nigerian rapper signed to Chocolate City. Blaqbonez is popularly known for his distinct rap style as well as his creative ingenuity. In 2019, he was profiled by The New York Times as one of the new guards of Nigerian music. He is widely known for his controversial self-proclaimed status as the \"Best Rapper in Africa\" (abbreviated as \"BRIA\"), which became the most talked about topic in the Nigerian hip hop space between July and September 2019. After carving out one of rap's most loyal fan bases, Blaqbonez unleashed his debut album “Sex Over Love” to a public that was more than ready to receive it. His unorthodox approach and humorous personality, resonated with the younger generation, and earned him co-signs from the likes of Wizkid and Burna Boy." ;

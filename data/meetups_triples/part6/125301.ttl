        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mary Baker Eddy (July 16, 1821 â€“ December 3, 1910) was an American religious leader and author who founded The Church of Christ, Scientist, in New England in 1879. She also founded The Christian Science Monitor, a Pulitzer Prize-winning secular newspaper, in 1908, and three religious magazines: the Christian Science Sentinel, The Christian Science Journal, and The Herald of Christian Science. She wrote numerous books and articles, the most notable of which was Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, which had sold over nine million copies as of 2001. Members of The First Church of Christ, Scientist consider Eddy the \"discoverer\" of Christian Science, and adherents are therefore known as Christian Scientists or students of Christian Science. The church is sometimes informally known as the Christian Science church. Eddy was named one of the \"100 Most Significant Americans of All Time\" in 2014 by Smithsonian Magazine, and her book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures was ranked as one of the \"75 Books by Women Whose Words Have Changed the World\" by the Women's National Book Association." ;

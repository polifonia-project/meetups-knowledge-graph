        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Trujillo, better known by his stage name Jay Tee, is a rapper, songwriter and hip hop producer from Vallejo, CA. He has been a part of the city's scene since the early 1990s as the lead member of N2Deep and Latino Velvet along with Baby Beesh. Even though N2Deep's 2000 album Slightly Pimpish/Mostly Doggish was a solo album, it was not until 2001 that Jay Tee released a solo album under his own name, So Cold. Latino Velvet was originally composed of Jay Tee and Baby Beesh in 1997 on the album Latino Velvet Project. Although the album featured several tracks with Frost and Don Cisco, it was not until 2000 that they were featured on the cover with equal billing to Jay Tee and Baby Beesh. Velvet City featured several west coast artists including: E-40, Levitti, Rappin' 4-Tay, Bosko, Cool Nutz and the Mary Jane Girls. Jay Tee is the founder and owner of 40 Ounce Records. Jay Tee has remained an underground presence in The Bay Area since his debut almost two decades ago." ;

As a songwriter and music arranger, Beckett collaborated with Tim Buckley in the late 1960s and early 1970s on several songs and albums, including the critically acclaimed \"Song to the Siren\" which has been recorded by many artists, from This Mortal Coil to Robert Plant. He has also collaborated with British group The Long Lost Band, and local Portland indie band Eyelids. Beckett has had several books of poetry published including Songs and Sonnets, Beat Poetry, and a few book-length poems entitled Paul Bunyan, Wyatt Earp, and Amelia Earhart. American Cycle, a 47-year project, will be published in April 2021 by Running Wild Press." ;

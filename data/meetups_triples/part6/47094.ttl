        mtp:hasAbstract        "Concetta Kirschner (born February 25, 1971), better known as Princess Superstar, is an American rapper and DJ. She has had two chart hits in the UK, \"Bad Babysitter\", which reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart in 2002, and \"Perfect (Exceeder)\", which reached number three in 2007. She has recorded with Moby, The Prodigy, Arthur Baker, Prince Paul, and Grandmaster Flash, amongst others. During the peak of her career, she was acclaimed as Pennsylvania's top female Jewish rapper. Her musical style, as she describes it, is \"flip-flop\"â€”a mixture of hip hop, electroclash and electronic. In summer 2014 she debuted her reality television show I Love Princess Superstar on her YouTube channel. In 2018 she released a children's record called These Are the Magic Days." ;

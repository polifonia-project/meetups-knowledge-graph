        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dennis James (born Demie James Sposa, August 24, 1917 â€“ June 3, 1997) was an American television personality, philanthropist, and commercial spokesman. Until 1976, he had appeared on TV more times and for a longer period than any other television star. Alternately referred to as \"The Dean of Game Show Hosts\" (along with fellow emcee Bill Cullen) and the \"Godfather of Gameshows\", he was the host of television's first network game show, the DuMont Network's Cash and Carry (1946). James was also the first person to host a telethon (raising more than $750,000,000 for United Cerebral Palsy throughout his nearly 5 decade run as its host), the first to appear in a television commercial (for Wedgwood china), first to emcee a variety show, and first to appear on video tape; more than 25 \"firsts\" in all." ;

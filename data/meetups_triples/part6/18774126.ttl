        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tyson Smith (born October 16, 1983), better known by the ring name Kenny Omega, is a Canadian-born professional wrestler. Omega is an executive vice president of All Elite Wrestling (AEW), in which he also performs. Omega is a former one-time AEW World Champion, one-time AEW World Tag Team Champion, and was one-third of the inaugural AEW World Trios Champions. Prior to joining AEW, Omega was known for his tenure in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), during which he held the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, the inaugural IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion, as well as several other titles. Also known for his video games-inspired persona, he was a member of the Bullet Club stable, later serving as the group's leader. Throughout his career, Omega has also performed as part of independent promotions worldwide, including DDT Pro-Wrestling, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, as well as larger national and international promotions, such as Ring of Honor, Impact Wrestling, and Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide. While wrestling in the last two promotions, he held the Impact World Championship and AAA Mega Championship. Hailed as one of the best professional wrestlers in the world, Omega was named Sports Illustrated's Wrestler of the Year in 2017, and topped Pro Wrestling Illustrated's list of top 500 male wrestlers the following year and in 2021. He has also attained the latter publication's Match of the Year distinction three times; one of those matches, in which Omega competed against Kazuchika Okada in a two out of three falls match at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall in June 2018, received a seven-star rating from combat sports journalist Dave Meltzer, the highest rating Meltzer has ever awarded a professional wrestling match. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 2020." ;

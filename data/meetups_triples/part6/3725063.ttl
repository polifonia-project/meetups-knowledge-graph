        mtp:hasAbstract        "Matthew \"Spider\" Burton (born 19 May 1970) is a retired Australian rules footballer. He played as a ruckman and began his Football career at Subiaco. \"Spider\" Burton, as he's commonly known, because of his 210 cm (6 ft 11 in) frame, was formerly the AFL's tallest player. He has since been eclipsed by another Docker in Aaron Sandilands, Western Bulldogs' Peter Street, Collingwoodâ€™s Mason Cox and Ned Reeves, all of whom stand at 211 cm tall." ;

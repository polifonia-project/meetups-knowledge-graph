        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kyle Pfeiffer (born June 9, 1990), known primarily by his stage name, Blacklite District, is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer from the Black Hills of South Dakota. Blacklite District's sound relies heavily on the influence of classic hard rock, heavy metal, alternative, and pop. He began writing music at age 10 as a way to cope after the death of his mother. Blacklite District rose to international YouTube fame in 2017-18 with the release of viral songs \"Cold As Ice\" and \"The Struggle\". Combined, the two songs have over 150 million streams across streaming platforms, and led to the release of Blacklite District's self-titled debut album in 2020. Blacklite District has had four Billboard Top 40 charting singles, over 200,000 subscribers on YouTube, and 500 million career streams. On December 31, 2021, Blacklite District released his latest album, 1990. The album featured the Top 40 rock single \"Gotta Get Outta Here\", and the album hit the Top 100 on the US iTunes Rock charts." ;

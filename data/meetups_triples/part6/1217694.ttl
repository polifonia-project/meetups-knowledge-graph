        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edward Gresham Ball (March 21, 1888 â€“ June 24, 1981) was a financier who wielded powerful political influence in Florida for decades. Referred to as \"a law unto himself\", despite the fact that he never held public office and did not own much of the assets he controlled, he led a forest products company, a railroad and owned newspapers. He worked for and with his brother-in-law Alfred I. du Pont for nine years before running the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust's businesses himself for another 46 years. He founded and led the St. Joe Paper Company to become a major player in several industries in Florida. He was a leader of the pro-segregation, anti-homosexual, and anti-communist Pork Chop Gang, a group of Democratic Party legislators from North Florida." ;

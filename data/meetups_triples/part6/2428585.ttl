Henry James Marris-McGee (14 May 1929 â€“ 28 January 2006) was a British actor, best known as straight man to Benny Hill for many years. McGee was also often the announcer on Hill's TV programme, delivering the upbeat intro \"Yes! It's The Benny Hill Show!\". He was familiar to British children throughout the 1970s as \"Mummy\" in the Sugar Puffs commercials, the catchphrase of which was \"Tell them about the honey, Mummy\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eugene Church (January 22, 1938 â€“ April 3, 1993) was an American R&B singer and songwriter. Church was born in St. Louis, Missouri. In the 1950s, he collaborated with Jesse Belvin releasing singles on Modern Records as The Cliques. Their 1956 single, \"The Girl in My Dreams\" b/w \"I Wanna Know Why\", peaked at #45 on the Billboard Hot 100. Late in the 1950s, he released four singles of his own, as Eugene Church & the Fellows. The first two were U.S. hits: \"Pretty Girls Everywhere\" went No. 6 R&B, No. 36 Pop, and \"Miami\" hit No. 14 R&B and No. 67 Pop. They were followed by \"Good News\" and \"Mind Your Own Business\", neither of which charted. Church later pursued a career in gospel music in Dallas, Texas, and returned to secular music in the 1990s in doo-wop revues. Church died from cancer in Los Angeles, California in April 1993, at age 55." ;

He currently hosts his own podcast series titled \"The Proving Ground with Tank Abbott.\" Abbott is perhaps best known for being an icon in the early stages of mixed martial arts and the UFC, but has also competed in the PRIDE Fighting Championships, Strikeforce, EliteXC, and Cage Rage. His fighting style, which he developed brawling in the bars and streets of Huntington Beach, California, was described by his future manager Dave Thomas as \"Pit Fighting\". He also authored a novel titled Bar Brawler." ;

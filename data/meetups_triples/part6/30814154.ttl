        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Edward Bradley (November 5, 1948 â€“ September 23, 2017) was an American singer. After years of obscurity and a part-time music career, Bradley came to prominence in his early 50s. His performances and recording style were consistent with the revivalist approach of his main label Daptone Records, celebrating the feel of funk and soul music from the 1960s and 1970s. One review said he \"echoes the evocative delivery of Otis Redding\". Called \"The Screaming Eagle of Soul\", Bradley was the subject of the documentary Soul of America which premiered at South by Southwest in 2012." ;

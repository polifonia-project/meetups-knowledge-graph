        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christopher Robert Turner (born 15 September 1958) is an English former footballer and who is now director of football at Wakefield. He made 589 league and cup appearances in a 19-year career as a professional in the English Football League, and then took charge of a further 469 matches as a manager. A goalkeeper, he began his career at hometown club Sheffield Wednesday, winning the club's Player of the Year award in his debut season in 1977–78. He then won a place on the PFA Team of the Year the following season, and also played on loan at Lincoln City, before being sold to Sunderland for £80,000 in July 1979. He helped Sunderland to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1979–80, and in 1985 played on the losing side in the League Cup final, before he was named as the club's Player of the Year. He was signed by Manchester United for a £275,000 fee in July 1985. He was sold back to Sheffield Wednesday for £175,000 in September 1988. He briefly played on loan at Leeds United the following year. He helped Wednesday to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1990–91, and kept a clean sheet against former club Manchester United as Wednesday won the League Cup in 1991. He was moved on to Leyton Orient for £75,000 in 1991, and again named on the PFA Team of the Year in 1991–92. He began his managerial career at Leyton Orient in August 1994, working alongside John Sitton. The pair were sacked in April 1995, and he coached at Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, before being appointed manager at Hartlepool United in February 1999. He turned the club from relegation candidates to consistent play-off challengers, and was lured to Sheffield Wednesday in November 2002. He lasted 22 months in the job, before he was sacked in September 2004. He took charge at Stockport County three months later, but was again unsuccessful, and left the club by mutual consent in December 2005. He returned to Hartlepool United as Director of Sport in February 2006, before being named as first-team manager in December 2008. He resigned in August 2010, and went on to work behind the scenes at Chesterfield, Port Vale and Wakefield." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Damián Gutiérrez Hernández (born April 12, 1976), better known by his ring name El Terrible, is a Mexican professional wrestler who currently works for the Mexican wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). He portrays a rudo (\"bad guy\") wrestling character. He started out under the ring name Engendro del Mal (\"Spawn of Evil\") and later adopted the name Damián El Terrible, before being shortened to his current name. His CMLL career started in 2002 and included winning the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, the Mexican National Heavyweight Championship, the CMLL World Tag Team Championship twice, with Tama Tonga and Rush, the CMLL World Trios Championship with Héctor Garza and Tarzan Boy. During his time in CMLL, he has also won several major tournaments, including the 2008 Leyenda Azul, the 2012 and 2019 Universal Championship, the 2012 Gran Alternativa with Euforia and the 2015 and 2018 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increíbles with Máximo and Rush respectively. Gutiérrez is currently the leader of Los Nuevos Ingobernables, alongside Ángel de Oro and Niebla Roja; he was the last remaining member of Los Ingobernables (\"The Ungovernables\") following the departure of leader Rush and his father La Bestia del Ring from the promotion. He was originally brought into CMLL as part of Los Guapos (\"The Handsome Ones\"), then later joined CMLL's main rudo faction Los Perros del Mal. When Los Perros del Mal left CMLL El Terrible was put together with Rey Bucanero and Texano Jr. to form La Fuerza TRT." ;

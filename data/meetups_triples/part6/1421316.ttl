He has composed the scores for many anime series, including Inuyasha, D.Gray-man, Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas, Samurai 7 and, more recently, Tesla Note.

Wada, along with other later-famous musicians, studied at the Tokyo College of Music under Akira Ifukube and Sei Ikeno. He is also an apprentice of the famed Godzilla composer, Akira Ifukube. He is married to Inuyasha voice actress Akiko Nakagawa, who voices Sota Higurashi in that anime." ;

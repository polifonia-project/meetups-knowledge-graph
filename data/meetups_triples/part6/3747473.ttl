She is the President of Living Proof Ministries, a Christian organization which she founded in 1994 to teach women to know and love Jesus through the study of Scripture. Living Proof Ministries is based in Houston, Texas. Moore is one of the most prominent American evangelical women, speaks at arena events and has sold millions of books. The ministry, in conjunction with LifeWay Christian Resources, conducts more than a dozen conferences, known as \"Living Proof Live\", around the United States annually. Travis Cottrell leads worship at the conferences. From 2007 to 2011, Moore, Kay Arthur, and Priscilla Shirer collaborated on another LifeWay weekend conference, \"Deeper Still: The Event\". Moore also teaches through her radio show, Living Proof with Beth Moore, and on her YouTube channel of the same name. She is of no relation to Baptist theologian and preacher Russell Moore. Additionally, Moore writes books and produces video resources based on the Bible studies that she conducts at the Living Proof Live conferences. She has taught at conferences for women in numerous countries, including Ireland, England, Singapore, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and India. She and her husband Keith joined the Anglican Church in North America in 2021." ;

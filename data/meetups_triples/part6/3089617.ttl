A member of the Democratic Party, he was first elected in the 2013 election, and reelected in 2017. A former member of the Los Angeles City Council, Garcetti served as City Council President from 2006 to 2012. He is the city's first elected Jewish mayor, and its second consecutive Mexican American mayor. He was elected as the youngest mayor in over 100 years, having been 42 at the time of his inauguration. In July 2021, Joe Biden nominated Garcetti as the United States Ambassador to India, but by May 2022 it was acknowledged Garcetti would not have the required votes in the Senate for confirmation." ;

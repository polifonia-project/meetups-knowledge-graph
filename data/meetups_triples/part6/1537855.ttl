Also known as Imp the Dimp, he was a member of the trio The Sugarhill Gang, the first hip hop act to have a hit with the cross-over single \"Rapper's Delight\" in the pop charts in 1979. He contributed to many documentaries based on the rap music industry. Lyrics to his verse from \"Rapper's Delight\" were plagiarized from rhymes written by Grandmaster Caz." ;

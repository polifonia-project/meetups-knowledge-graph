In his survey of contemporary French cinema, Tim Palmer discusses Civeyrac's career in the context of his teaching at the major French film school, la Fémis; Civeyrac's status as an \"applied cinephile\" in which he carefully cites and revives the aesthetics of historical filmmakers like Mizoguchi and Cocteau; his neglected situation outside France; and his position as a remarkably uncompromising director, whose films often refuse to differentiate between fantasy and diegetic reality." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tiffany Pollard (born January 6, 1982) is an American television personality. She came to public prominence for her participation on the first two seasons of VH1's Flavor of Love (2006–2007). Pollard was given the nickname \"New York\" by rapper Flavor Flav. She is also known colloquially by her self-proclaimed nickname \"HBIC\" (\"Head Bitch in Charge\"), which she exclaimed in the Flavor of Love series to taunt her competitors. Her temperamental nature often led to tension with the other women on the show. Pollard starred in the show's spin-off I Love New York (2007–2008). In recent years, Pollard took part in the 17th series of Celebrity Big Brother in early 2016, finishing in fourth place. In 2017, Pollard began hosting Brunch with Tiffany, a talk show series featured on VH1's YouTube channel, which was later picked up debuting on the VH1 television network. In 2022, Pollard began hosting Hot Haus, a queer sex reality competition on OutTV. She has also previously hosted the Fenty Beauty holiday gift guide twice." ;

Russel was born in Ladysmith, South Africa, and joined Ladysmith Black Mambazo in 1976. It was at this time that Joseph converted to Christianity, which saw the group's output include Zulu hymns and songs of a religious nature. Russel joined the group as a bass voice, along with Jabulani Dubazana (who later sung as a tenor voice). Russel has been a full-time member of the group since the 1980s." ;

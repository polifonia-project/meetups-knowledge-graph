Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair named it his favourite score of the year, dubbing it \"a string-heavy stunner\", though Dennis Harvey writing for Variety magazine described it as \"clich√©d, saccharine score\". Gregson was interviewed as part of BBC Radio Ulster's Classical Connections with John Toal programme in May 2015." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alan Ward (born 10 August 1947) is an English former cricketer, who played in five Test matches for the England cricket team between 1969 and 1976. He played for Derbyshire County Cricket Club from 1966 to 1976, and for Leicestershire from 1977 to 1978. A fast right-arm bowler, he could, with more fortune, have been the perfect foil of his era for John Snow. Injury-plagued, and subject to great fluctuations in form, he never fulfilled his promise." ;

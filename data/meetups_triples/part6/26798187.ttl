        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julie Aileen Kelly (1 November 1913 â€“ 22 October 1991), known professionally as Judy Kelly, was an Australian-born British actress. She arrived in Britain in 1932 after winning a competition organised by the Australian British Empire Films, which included 3 months tuition at the British International Studios at Elstree. She appeared in a number of films for British International Pictures during the 1930s. She was sometimes cast as a love interest for the comedian Leslie Fuller, and also appeared alongside the musical stars Gene Gerrard and Stanley Lupino. She appeared in the 1941 stage musical Lady Behave. Other wartime stage roles include Vernon Sylvaine's Women Aren't Angels and Warn That Man. Her final film was a supporting role in the comedy Warning to Wantons in 1949." ;

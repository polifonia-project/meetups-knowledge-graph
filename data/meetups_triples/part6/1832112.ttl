        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frank Mohammed Sinclair (born 3 December 1971) is an English-born Jamaican former professional football player and manager and current coach at Doncaster Rovers. He made 756 league and cup appearances in a 25-year playing career, scoring 27 goals. A defender, he began his career at Chelsea, turning professional in May 1990 and then making his debut in the Football League in April 1991. He played on loan at West Bromwich Albion between December 1991 and March 1992. He established himself in the first-team back at Chelsea during the 1992–93 Premier League campaign and went on to be named as the club's Player of the Year for 1993. He played on the losing side in the 1994 FA Cup final, before picking up a winners medal after Chelsea beat Middlesbrough 2–0 in the 1997 final. Chelsea also won the League Cup by beating Middlesbrough 2–0 in the final the following year, and Sinclair scored the opening goal in extra-time. Chelsea also won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1998, though Sinclair was ruled out of the final due to injury. He was sold on to Leicester City in August 1998 for a fee of £2 million. He won his second League Cup final in 2000, as Leicester defeated Tranmere Rovers 2–1. He spent a total of six seasons at Leicester, five of which were spent in the Premier League, the exception being the 2002–03 First Division promotion campaign. He joined Championship club Burnley on a free transfer in June 2004 and served as club captain from January 2005 to summer 2006. He joined League One side Huddersfield Town on an emergency loan in February 2007, which became a permanent transfer in the summer. He dropped into League Two to join Lincoln City in July 2008, who loaned him out to Wycombe Wanderers in March 2009; he helped Wycombe to win promotion out of League Two at the end of the 2008–09 season. He then spent the next two seasons in the Conference with Wrexham, before playing for Hendon in November 2011 and Colwyn Bay in January 2012. Born in England, he was called up to represent Jamaica at the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and played five games as the team finished in fourth-place after losing to Brazil in the third-place play-off match. He also played all three of his country's games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He went on to feature twice in the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup and ended his international career in October 2003 after a total of 28 caps. Sinclair was appointed as player-manager at Colwyn Bay in February 2013 and was named as Conference North Manager of the Month in April and December 2013. He went on to serve Brackley Town as caretaker-manager in October 2015 and served as Hednesford Town manager from December 2015 to April 2016. He later spent time as a coach at Stoke City, Radcliffe, Port Vale and Doncaster Rovers. He is the father of fellow professional footballer Tyrese Sinclair.

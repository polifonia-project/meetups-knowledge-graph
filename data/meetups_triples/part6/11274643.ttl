        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elizabeth Cook (born July 18, 1972) is an American country music singer and radio host. She has made over 400 appearances on the Grand Ole Opry since her debut on March 17, 2000, despite not being a member. Cook, \"the daughter of a hillbilly singer married to a moonshiner who played his upright bass while in a prison band\", was \"virtually unknown to the pop masses\" before she made a debut appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman in June 2012. The New York Times called her \"a sharp and surprising country singer\" and an \"idiosyncratic traditionalist\"." ;

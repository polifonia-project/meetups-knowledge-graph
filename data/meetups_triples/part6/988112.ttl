In 1914 he joined the navy, where he rose to lieutenant. After the end of World War I he matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge on a scholarship; it was while at Cambridge that he edited an anthology of student poetry and met the writer J. B. Priestley, who would remain a lifelong friend. Davison emigrated to the United States in 1925, and became an academic, teaching at Vassar College, the University of Miami, and the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he was involved in the Colorado Writers 1937 conference. He was a friend of Robert Frost. The poet Peter Davison is his son. He was widely published as a poet in the 1920s, featured in the J. C. Squire anthologies, and became known as a writer of sonnets.His Be Thou At Peace has been set to music by John Raynor." ;

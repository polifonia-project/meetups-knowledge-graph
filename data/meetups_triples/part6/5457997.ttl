        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeremy Shane Guthrie (born April 8, 1979) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies, Kansas City Royals, and Washington Nationals. Prior to playing professionally, he attended Stanford University. Guthrie was selected by the Indians in the first-round of the 2002 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut in 2004, but continued to stay in the Indians' minor-league system. In 2007, he was claimed off waivers by the Orioles, where he had a 3.70 ERA and went 7–5 across 32 starts. In 2009, he pitched for Team USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In 2012, he was traded twice, landing on the Royals in July. He proved to be the best pitcher for the Royals in the second half of the season, posting a 3.16 ERA and a 5–3 record. In 2014, he made his only appearance in the postseason, including two starts in the 2014 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, going 1–1. After becoming a free agent at the end of the 2015 season, he signed multiple minor-league contracts before being released each time. In 2017, he signed with the Nationals and appeared in one game before being released." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sharon Rachel Osbourne (née Levy, later Arden; born 9 October 1952) is a British-American television personality, music manager and author. She is married to heavy metal singer-songwriter Ozzy Osbourne and came to prominence while appearing on The Osbournes (2002–2005), a reality television show that aired on MTV, which followed her family's daily life. Osbourne later became a talent show judge on television shows, such as The X Factor (2004–2007, 2013, 2016–2017) and America's Got Talent (2007–2012). Osbourne is credited with reviving her husband's heavy metal career by founding the summer Ozzfest tour, which was held almost annually between 1996 and 2018. From 2003 to 2006, she hosted her own television talk show The Sharon Osbourne Show. In 2010, Osbourne was a contestant on NBC's The Celebrity Apprentice, and became a co-host on the CBS talk show The Talk, appearing until her termination in 2021. In 2022, she joined TalkTV, hosting a prime time show also titled The Talk. Osbourne has released three autobiographies and two novels. Her first autobiography, Extreme, debuted at number one on the Sunday Times best-seller list and went on to become the most successful female autobiography ever. Osbourne holds both British and American citizenship and has resided in the United States with her husband since 2002." ;

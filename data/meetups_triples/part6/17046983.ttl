She has had a successful career spanning some 80 years, both locally and internationally, including in the United Kingdom and United States She was given the nickname of \"Lolly-Legs Lamond\" by actor Noel Ferrier, after being voted as having the second-best pair of legs in television while appearing on TV show In Melbourne Tonight. Lamond started her career as a variety entertainer at only ten and was the first woman in the world to host a midday show. The second was her younger half-sister Helen Reddy. She appeared in the series Number 96 as Karen Winters in a controversial \"Black Mass\" storyline Alongside contemporaries Jill Perryman and Nancye Hayes, she has been called one of the three grand dames of Australian musical theatre, and in her prime a talent that could rival Doris Day" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harrison Potter (May 9, 1891 â€“ October 3, 1984) was an American pianist and educator. Potter was born in North Adams, Massachusetts and studied piano with Felix Fox, and, in Paris, Isidor Philipp. Early in his career, Potter taught for a time at Boston's Fox-Buonamici Piano School. He also served as assistant conductor of the 301st Army Regiment Band during World War I. He performed widely as a recitalist and accompanist during his career. Potter's recording of Charles Tomlinson Griffes' Piano Sonata is referenced in the 1943 first edition of Edward Maisel's biography of Griffes, though due to its unavailability at the time of the second edition, other recordings were referenced instead. From 1946 to 1957, Potter taught at Mount Holyoke College. He was also the Chautauqua Institution's Choral Director from 1948 to 1952. Potter also taught at the Felix Fox School of Pianoforte Playing in Boston, Massachusetts and Sarah Lawrence College. He died in Holyoke, Massachusetts in 1984." ;

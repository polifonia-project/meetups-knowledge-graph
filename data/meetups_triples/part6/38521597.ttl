        mtp:hasAbstract        "DeShane Davis Larkin (born October 2, 1992) is an American-Turkish professional basketball player for Anadolu Efes of the Turkish Basketball Super League and the EuroLeague. He also represents the senior Turkish national team in international competition. He played college basketball for the University of Miami. He was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 18th overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, where he was immediately traded to the Dallas Mavericks. He last played in the NBA in 2018 with the Boston Celtics. Larkin is the son of Hall of Fame baseball player Barry Larkin. Larkin holds the record for the most points scored in a single EuroLeague game since the 2000–01 season, with 49 points scored on November 29, 2019. The record does not include the EuroLeague's games played from 1958–2000, when FIBA ran the competition. That record is held by Radivoj Korać, who scored 99 points in a single EuroLeague game on January 14, 1965." ;

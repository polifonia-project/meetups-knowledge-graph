        mtp:hasAbstract        "Glenn Brown CBE (born 1966 in Hexham, Northumberland) is a British artist known for the use of appropriation in his paintings. Starting with reproductions from other artists' works, Glenn Brown transforms the appropriated image by changing its colour, position, orientation, height and width relationship, mood and/or size. Despite these changes, he has occasionally been accused of plagiarism. His work has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions including Domaine de Kerguéhennec, Centre d’Art Contemporain, France (2000); Serpentine Gallery, London (2004); Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (2008); Tate Liverpool, England (2009), which travelled to the Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin, Ludwig Múzeum, Budapest (2010); Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem, The Netherlands (2014); Fondation Vincent Van Gogh, Arles, France (2016); Des Moines Art Center, Iowa (2016); Contemporary Arts Center, Ohio (2017); Rembrandt House Museum, Amsterdam (2017); Museo Stefano Bardini, Florence (2017); and British Museum, London (2018); and numerous group exhibitions including The Saatchi Gallery (1995, 2015); Centre Georges Pompidou (2002, 2014); Venice Biennale, Italian Pavilion, (2003); Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2005); Gwangju Biennale, Korea (2010), Kunsthalle, Vienna (2011), Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague (2012), Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao (2013), Rennie Collection, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (2013), Cognacq-Jay Museum, Paris (2015); Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh (2018), Museum of Fine Arts-Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest (2019); and British Museum, London (2019). Brown lives and works in London and Suffolk, England. He was nominated for the Turner Prize in 2000. There was some controversy over his exhibition at Tate Britain for the Turner Prize, as one of the paintings was closely based on the science-fiction illustration \"Double Star\" produced in 1973 by the artist Tony Roberts. Brown was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to art." ;

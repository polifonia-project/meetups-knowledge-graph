        mtp:hasAbstract        "Caitlin Canty (born January 24, 1982) is an American singer/songwriter. The San Francisco Chronicle calls Canty's alto a \"casually devastating voice\" and NPR says her music mixes \"a gritty side with aching ballads.\" Her latest album, Motel Bouquet, was produced by Noam Pikelny (Punch Brothers) and was recorded live over three days in Nashville, TN. The band features Aoife O’Donovan (vocals), Paul Kowert (bass), Stuart Duncan (fiddle), Gabe Witcher (fiddle), Russ Pahl (pedal steel), and Pikelny on electric guitar and banjo. Rolling Stone has described her new music “dreamy and daring” and she was one of Rolling Stone Country’s “Ten Country artists you need to know.\" Originally from Vermont, Canty moved to East Nashville, Tennessee in 2015. She tours internationally and spends much of her time on the road. Canty writes and performs primarily on a 1930s Recording King guitar." ;

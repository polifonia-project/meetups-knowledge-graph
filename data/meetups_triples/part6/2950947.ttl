        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dan Rice (January 23, 1823 â€“ February 22, 1900) was an American entertainer of many talents, most famously as a clown, who was active before the American Civil War. At the height of his career, Rice was a household name. Dan Rice also coined the terms \"One Horse Show\" and \"Greatest Show\" while popularizing the barrel-style \"French\" cuff. He was a figure in the new American mass culture brought on by the technological changes of the Industrial Revolution. Rice ran for President of the United States in 1868. With changes in circus venues and popular culture after the Civil War, his fame has gradually slipped into such historical obscurity that in 2001 biographer David Carlyon called him \"the most famous man you've never heard of\"." ;

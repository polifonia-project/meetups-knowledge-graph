        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mordechai Tzemach Eliyahu (Hebrew: מרדכי צמח אליהו, March 3, 1929 – June 7, 2010, on the Hebrew calendar: 21 Adar I, 5689 - 25 Siwan, 5770), was an Israeli rabbi, posek, and spiritual leader. The son of a Jerusalem Kabbalist, in his youth Eliyahu was active in Brit HaKanaim, a radical religious underground organization. He served as a dayan in Beersheba, and in the Supreme Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem. He later served as the Rishon LeZion, or Chief Rabbi of Israel, from 1983 to 1993. As a leader of Religious Zionism, Eliyahu was instrumental in moving many of its members over to the religious right, sparking the beginnings of the Hardal movement. A supporter of Meir Kahane and Jonathan Pollard, Eliyahu expressed his opposition to the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. Eliyahu died at age 81 after complications from a heart condition. He was buried on Har HaMenuchot in Jerusalem." ;

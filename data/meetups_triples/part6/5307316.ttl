He also holds the second highest number of race wins at 59. He is the son of former motorcycle racer George Fogarty. In 2011, Fogarty was named a FIM Legend for his motorcycling achievements. Retired from racing since 2000, Fogarty is renowned for his high corner speed riding style, combined with an aggressive competitiveness, which brought him 59 victories and four World Superbike Championships (1994, 1995, 1998 and 1999).

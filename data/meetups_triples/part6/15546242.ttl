        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zbigniew Drzewiecki (Polish pronunciation: [ˈzbiɡɲɛv dʐɛˈvjɛtskʲi]; 8 April 1890 – 11 April 1971) was a Polish pianist who was for most of his life a teacher of pianists. He was especially associated with the interpretation of Frédéric Chopin's works. His pupils include several famous pianists of the 20th century, and his influence was therefore very pervasive. Drzewiecki was born in Warsaw. He commenced study under his father, and then, at Warsaw, under Oberfeldt and Pilecki. After he had matriculated he went (from 1909 to 1914) to Vienna, to the atelier of Theodor Leschetizky, where he studied with , the master's assistant. He gave many recitals in Polish towns, and also in Vienna, Prague and Berlin. In 1916 he became professor of advanced pianoforte classes at the Warsaw Conservatory, and continued to teach there until his death in 1971. He assisted in establishing the International Chopin Piano Competition, and served upon their juries from the first occasion, 1927, until 1971. After the Second World War, and especially after the death of Józef Turczyński (1884–1953), he was considered the greatest Polish piano teacher." ;

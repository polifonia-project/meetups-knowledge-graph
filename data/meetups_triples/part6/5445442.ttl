        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frank \"Poncho\" Sampedro (born Manuel Francisco Sampedro de Victoria, February 25, 1949) is an American guitarist and member of the rock band Crazy Horse, known mainly for his longtime collaboration with singer-songwriter Neil Young. Sampedro has played and recorded with Young in many other configurations aside from Crazy Horse and earned co-writing credits on several Young songs. Out of all Young's musical collaborators (aside from the late pedal steel guitarist Ben Keith), Sampedro has proven perhaps the most adept at working with the mercurial artist. \"Most people turn a corner. Neil ricochets,\" says Sampedro." ;

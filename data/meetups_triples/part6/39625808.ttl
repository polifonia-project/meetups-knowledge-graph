In July 1975 his single, \"Denim and Lace\", peaked at No. 8 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. He had another hit in June 1977 with \"Mean Pair of Jeans\", which reached No. 10. As an actor, he appeared on the Australian stage in Godspell (1972–73); on TV in Number 96 (1974) and Class of '75 (1975); and in the London theatre production of The King and I (1979–80) alongside Yul Brynner. From late 1987 to August 1990, he was the business manager of a trio of brothers, the Australian boxing champions: Dean (heavyweight class), Guy (light heavyweight) and Troy Waters (junior middleweight)." ;

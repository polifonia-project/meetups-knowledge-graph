        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Barton (May 25, 1902 â€“ December 5, 1981) was an American film and vaudeville actor and film director. He won an Oscar for best assistant director in 1933. His first film as a director was the Zane Grey feature Wagon Wheels, starring Randolph Scott, in 1934. Barton worked in Hollywood B-movie units. From 1946, he was a principal director of the Abbott and Costello comedies, such as The Time of Their Lives, Buck Privates Come Home, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Africa Screams. He later directed Walt Disney films such as The Shaggy Dog and Toby Tyler. His extensive work for television included every episode of Amos 'n' Andy in the 1950s, a total of 90 episodes of Dennis the Menace in the 1960s, and 106 episodes of Family Affair from 1967 to 1971. One obituary said he directed 580 television episodes, 70 feature films and dozens of commercials." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kapila (Sanskrit: कपिल), also referred to as Cakradhanus, is a sage in Hindu tradition. According to Bhagavata Purana, he is the son of the sage Kardama and Devahuti, the daughter of the Svayambhuva Manu. Kardama had nine daughters, who were very learned and went ahead to marry Marici, as well as other great sages. When he came of age, Kapila is most well-known as the founder of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. Kapila of Samkhya fame is considered a Vedic sage, estimated to have lived in the 6th-century BCE, or the 7th-century BCE. His home was in Mithila. His influence on Buddha and Buddhism have long been the subject of scholarly studies. According to the Brahmanda Purana, Kapila is described to be an incarnation of Vishnu: \"Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa will protect us all. The Lord of the universe has now been born in the world as Kapilācārya.\" Many historic personalities in Hinduism and Jainism, mythical figures, pilgrimage sites in Indian religion, as well as an ancient variety of cow, are named after Kapila, or share his name." ;

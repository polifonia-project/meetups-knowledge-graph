Square has also composed music for dance performance, most notably Rhythm and Hues, a kinaesthetic exploration of 20th-century works of art in collaboration with the Tate Gallery and Helen McCookerybook. Also in collaboration with McCookerybook, he composed soundtrack music for the Channel 4 documentaries Pictures of Women and No-one Likes Us, We Don't Care, Akiko Hada and Wolfgang Müller's 1991 parable on the fall of the Berlin Wall, The Fall of a Queen, or the Taste of the Fruit to Come. He has released five solo albums since leaving The Monochrome Set: Carcass in 2017, Serotonin in 2018, Chautauqua in 2019, Nuevo Laredo in 2021 and Invisible Man in 2022. As a visual artist Square has regularly exhibited his work and between 1996 and 2004 he sat on the editorial board of The International Journal of Art and Design Education , acting as Literary Editor for 5 years. In 2006 he edited “Art Education in a Postmodern World” (Intellect Books).

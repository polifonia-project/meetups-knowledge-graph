        mtp:hasAbstract        "Art Greenhaw (born July 14, 1954) is an American musician, record producer and audio engineer who was awarded the Grammy Award in 2003 for the Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album for We Called Him Mr. Gospel Music: The James Blackwood Tribute Album. Additionally, he founded the independent record label, Greenhaw Records. Greenhaw is the bassist, multi-instrumentalist and manager for the Light Crust Doughboys, which he officially joined as a band member in 1993 under the direction of Marvin \"Smokey\" Montgomery, one of Greenhaw's musical mentors. The symphony performances and other enterprises of the Light Crust Doughboys in the 1990s and in the new millennium, are largely the product of Greenhaw's imagination and promotional skill. In addition, his musicianship, production, arranging and songwriting has included work with Nokie Edwards, Tom Brumley, James Blackwood, Ann-Margret, Engelbert Humperdinck, Trini Lopez and Ronnie Dawson." ;

At age eighteen, Hensley moved to Newport Beach, California to study to become an aesthetician. She also opened a tanning salon and did some modeling. After placing in the Top 20 in a Hawaiian Tropic pageant, she submitted photos to Playboy. It was not until the second time she submitted photos that she received a callback and became a Playmate. She made an appearance on the television series Bikini Destinations in 2008. Hensley was born in Price, Utah. She was found dead of an apparent overdose, in the bathtub at a friend's home in Los Angeles, California, on January 15, 2014." ;

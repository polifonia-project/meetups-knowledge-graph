Five of his studio albums have topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, with Aura (2018) charting at number seven on the Billboard 200. His musical style is primarily reggaeton and trap, but he has collaborated with artists spanning a variety of genres, including reggae, bachata, and moombahton. Born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, he decided to become a singer at age 12, drawing influence from the Latin American genres of reggaeton, salsa, and bachata. He made his musical debut in 2012 with the song \"Imaginando\", which attracted the attention of recording labels and led to collaborations with Daddy Yankee and Anuel AA. He released several singles before signing with Sony Music Latin in 2017, who funded the recording of his debut album Odisea. His second studio album Aura, released on August 24, 2018, debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200. His 2018 collaboration with DJ Snake, Cardi B, and Selena Gomez on \"Taki Taki\" was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA. He released his third studio album, Nibiru on November 29, 2019. His fourth studio album, ENOC, was released in September 2020. Since the beginning of his career, he has sold around 15 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin American music artists of all time. On 1 February 2019 Ozuna had the most one billion-view videos on YouTube of any artist and he has won two Latin Grammy Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, twelve Billboard Latin Music Awards, four Guinness World Records, among other accolades. In 2019, Time included him on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. He made his acting debut in the film Que León. He appeared in F9, the ninth film in the Fast & Furious franchise." ;

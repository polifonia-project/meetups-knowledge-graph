He also raced in NASCAR's now named Monster Energy Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Camping World Truck Series. He is best known for competing in NASCAR's Whelen Modified Tour, where he has over 40 victories and a championship in 2008. He was also well known for his success on the 1.058 mile New Hampshire Motor Speedway where Christopher has won five Camping World East Series events and 5 Whelen Modified Tour events.

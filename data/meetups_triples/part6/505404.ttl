He was also the first elected president in Singapore's history. A former member of the governing People's Action Party (PAP) and Ong served as Chairman of the People's Action Party between 1981 and 1993, after Toh Chin Chye stepped down from the position. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Kim Keat SMC between 1972 and 1991, and Toa Payoh GRC between 1991 and 1993. He also served as Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts between 1978 and 1981, Minister for Manpower between 1981 and 1983, and Deputy Prime Minister between 1985 and 1993. Ong resigned from the PAP and his political positions and contested in the 1993 presidential election as an independent candidate and won. He was sworn on 1 September 1993 as the fifth president of Singapore. He decided not to run for a second term as president in 1999 partially due to the death of his wife. Ong died in his sleep from lymphoma at the Singapore General Hospital on 8 February 2002, at the age of 66." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yanis Sahraoui (born 16 September 1988)is a French pop musician and singer-songwriter. Yanis (who uses gender-neutral pronouns since 2021) debuted in the late 2000s under the stage name Sliimy (pronounced \"Slimmy\") through social networking websites where they released their songs. The artist soon received attention online and signed into recording label Warner Music Group, releasing the single Wake Up and their debut album Paint Your Face in 2009, which reached number 2 in the French charts. The singer then performed on stage, in concerts and in opening acts for Britney Spears and Katy Perry. The artist, singing mostly in English with an accent that has been described as \"mockney\", with androgynous looks and a falsetto voice, was compared to Mika or Prince by the press. They were sometimes also dubbed \"the French Mika\" in their native France and internationally. In 2015, the singer began performing as Yanis, and released the EP L'heure Bleue in 2016." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Vincent Campbell (23 June 1863-16 December 1930) was a physician, missionary and an entomological collector in India. He helped establish sanatoria for tuberculosis treatment in Madanapalle, a hospital in Jammalamadugu which is now named after him, and the Ralph Wardlaw Thompson memorial hospital at Chikkaballapur (now known as the CSI Hospital) and was awarded a Kaiser-i-Hind for his contributions to the health of the poor. His collections of Hemiptera from India resulted in the descriptions of many new species of bug, several of which were named after him." ;

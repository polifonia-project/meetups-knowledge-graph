        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeurys Familia Mojica (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxewɾis faˈmilja]; born October 10, 1989) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Oakland Athletics, Philadelphia Phillies and the Boston Red Sox. Familia was signed by the Mets as a non-drafted free agent in 2007. He made his MLB debut in 2012, and became the team's closer in 2015. He was named an MLB All-Star in 2016. The Mets traded him to the Athletics in July 2018, then re-signed him in late 2018 to a three-year deal that spanned the 2019–2021 seasons. He then spent parts of the 2022 season with the Phillies and Red Sox." ;

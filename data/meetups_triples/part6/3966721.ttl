        mtp:hasAbstract        "Attilio Lombardo (Italian pronunciation: [atˈtiːljo lomˈbardo]; born 6 January 1966) is an Italian retired football player turned manager; he is currently the assistant manager for the Italy national team. Throughout his career he was usually deployed as a wide midfielder, or as an offensive right winger, although he also played as a fullback or wingback on occasion later in his career. Lombardo played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, and is best known for his two spells with Sampdoria. He is one of the six players to have won the Serie A title with three different teams: Sampdoria, Juventus, and Lazio; the other five players to have managed the same feat are Giovanni Ferrari, Filippo Cavalli, Pietro Fanna, Sergio Gori, and Aldo Serena. Lombardo also had a spell in the Premier League with English side Crystal Palace. At international level, Lombardo represented the Italy national football team on 19 occasions, although he was never called up for a major tournament. During his career, he was given the nicknames \"Popeye\", as he was thought to resemble the cartoon character's appearance due to his own bald head and strong physique, as well as \"the Ostrich\" (or \"Struzzo\", in Italian), because of his pace, stamina, and running style. He was also given the nickname \"The Bald Eagle\" during his time at Crystal Palace." ;

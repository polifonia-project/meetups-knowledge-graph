        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Mark O'Donnell (born 12 September 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for EFL League Two club Rochdale. Having started his career with Sheffield Wednesday's youth system, O'Donnell progressed to the first team where he was largely used as an understudy goalkeeper. He played 20 times for Wednesday between 2006 and 2012, earning a significant amount of first-team appearances elsewhere as he spent time on loan with York City, Buxton, Rotherham United, Oldham Athletic, Grimsby Town, Alfreton Town and Macclesfield Town. He was released in the summer of 2012 and joined Chesterfield. In 2013, following limited first-team appearances, he signed a one-year contract at Walsall." ;

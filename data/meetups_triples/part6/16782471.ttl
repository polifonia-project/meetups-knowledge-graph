        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Dee Wilson (July 31, 1948 – October 16, 2018) was an American jazz alto saxophonist. Born in Wichita Falls, Texas, Wilson began playing saxophone at age 11, and led his own trio while still in high school. He attended North Texas State University and spent much of his career in various big band ensembles. He was with Jerry Gray at the Fairmont Hotel in Dallas around 1972, and following the leader's death in 1976, he played with Buddy Rich from 1977 to 1980. He did much studio work in New York City in the 1980s, on clarinet and flute in addition to saxophone. He played with Tito Puente in 1980–81, Gerry Mulligan from 1981 to 1989, Bob Wilber (1983), Loren Schoenberg (1984), Benny Goodman's last ensemble (1985–86), Buck Clayton (1986–90), and Walt Levinsky. He was with Howard Alden and Dan Barrett's quintet from 1985 to 1991. He led his own group, Chuck Wilson and Friends, from 1996, which included Murray Wall, Alden, and Joel Helleny as sidemen. Wilson died on October 16, 2018 at the age of 70 in New York City." ;

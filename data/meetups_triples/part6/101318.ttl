        mtp:hasAbstract        "Isabelle Yasmina Adjani LdH; born 27 June 1955) is a French actress and singer of Algerian and German descent. She is the only performer in history to win five César Awards for acting; she won the Best Actress award for Possession (1981), One Deadly Summer (1983), Camille Claudel (1988), La Reine Margot (1994) and Skirt Day (2009). She was made a Knight of France's Legion of Honour in 2010 and a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters in 2014. Her performance as Adèle Hugo in the 1975 film The Story of Adèle H. earned then 20-year-old Adjani her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, making her the youngest nominee in the Best Actress category at the time. Her second nomination—for Camille Claudel–made her the first French actress to receive two nominations for foreign-language films. She won the Best Actress award at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival for her performances in Possession and Quartet, and, later, she won the Best Actress award at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival for Camille Claudel. Her other notable film performances include The Tenant (1976), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), Subway (1985), Diabolique (1996) and French Women (2014)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kevin Wu (born June 12, 1990) is an American former YouTuber best known under the username KevJumba. The San Francisco Chronicle's Jeff Yang has noted that Wu is not a comedian in the conventional sense but that by \"just talking [he] is, well, pretty hilarious\" due to his deadpan vocal delivery, animated facial expressions and tendency toward unexpected digressions. Wu previously appeared on The CW Television Network's short-lived Online Nation and co-starred with Jessica Lee Rose and Philip DeFranco in Hooking Up from HBOLabs (the online arm of HBO) in 2008. In 2010, Wu and his father, Michael, competed as a team on the 17th season of The Amazing Race, placing seventh out of eleven teams. In 2014, Wu starred in crime drama film Revenge of the Green Dragons (executive produced by Martin Scorsese). In 2013, Wu ceased production of YouTube content. In 2016, Wu returned for a brief period of time on social media. In November 2020, Wu created an account on Twitch, originally titled cybermuse." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Simon Joseph Bridges (born 12 October 1976) is a former New Zealand politician and lawyer. He served as Leader of the National Party and Leader of the Opposition between 2018 and 2020, and as the Member of Parliament for Tauranga from the 2008 election to May 2022, when he resigned. A self-described \"compassionate conservative\", Bridges served in several Cabinet positions, including Minister of Transport (2014–2017) and Minister of Economic Development (2016–2017). He took the role of Leader of the House from May to October 2017. Bridges was elected as National Party leader on 27 February 2018, succeeding former Prime Minister Bill English, who resigned. He became the first person with Māori ancestry to serve as leader of a major party in New Zealand. On 22 May 2020, following poor polling for the party, Bridges was challenged for the party leadership and replaced by Todd Muller, who would relinquish the leadership less than two months later. On 24 November 2021, Bridges was sacked from the shadow cabinet of Judith Collins, who cited a crude comment he made to fellow MP Jacqui Dean in 2016 that had been previously dealt with, with Bridges formally apologising to Dean in private. Collins' actions triggered a successful vote of no-confidence in her leadership by the National Party caucus the following day, with a leadership election scheduled for 30 November 2021. Bridges had intended to contest the election, but withdrew on the day of the vote and endorsed Christopher Luxon. Bridges announced his retirement from politics in March 2022, triggering a by-election." ;

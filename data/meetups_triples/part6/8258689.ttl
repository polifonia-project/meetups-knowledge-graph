        mtp:hasAbstract        "Pedro Infante Cruz (Spanish: [ˈpeðɾo iɱˈfante]; 18 November 1917 – 15 April 1957) was a Mexican ranchera music singer and actor, whose career spanned the golden age of Mexican cinema. His popularity spread across Latin America. Infante was born in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, and raised in nearby Guamúchil. He died on 15 April 1957 in Mérida, Yucatán, while en route to Mexico City when his plane crashed due to engine failure. From 1939 until his death, Infante acted in over 60 films (30 of them with his brother Ángel) and recorded over 350 songs. For his performance in the movie Tizoc, he was posthumously awarded the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival." ;

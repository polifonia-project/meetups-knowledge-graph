        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Henry Mapleson (Colonel Mapleson) (4 May 1830 â€“ 14 November 1901) was an English opera impresario, a leading figure in the development of opera production, and of the careers of singers, in London and New York in the mid-19th century. Born in a musical family he briefly pursued a career as a singer, before turning to management. In the 1860s he was the dominant force in London's operatic scene. At the Academy of Music in New York, from 1879 to 1883 he presented opera in an unprecedentedly glamorous style. After his early successes Mapleson failed to keep pace with changing public tastes. His productions and repertoire were seen as old-fashioned and he was no longer able to engage the top operatic stars, who were to be seen at the Metropolitan Opera and Covent Garden." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Taylor Daniel Lautner (/ˈlaʊtnər/; born February 11, 1992) is an American actor. He is best known for playing shapeshifter Jacob Black in The Twilight Saga film series. Lautner began his acting career playing bit parts in comedy series such as The Bernie Mac Show (2003) and My Wife and Kids (2004), before having voice roles in television series like What's New, Scooby-Doo? (2005) and Danny Phantom (2005). In 2005, he appeared in the film Cheaper by the Dozen 2 and starred in The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D. He also starred in the 2011 action film Abduction. From 2014 to 2018, Lautner starred in the BBC sitcom Cuckoo as the son of the titular character. In 2016, he played a leading role, Dr. Cassidy Cascade, in the second season of FOX black comedy series Scream Queens. The late 2000s saw Lautner become a teen idol and sex symbol, after extensively changing his physique to keep the role of Jacob Black in further Twilight installments, and generating media attention for his looks. In 2010, he was ranked second on Glamour's \"The 50 Sexiest Men of 2010\" list, and fourth on People's \"Most Amazing Bodies\" list. Also in the same year, Lautner was named the highest-paid teenage actor in Hollywood." ;

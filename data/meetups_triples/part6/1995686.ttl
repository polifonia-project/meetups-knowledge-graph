Her obituary in The Irish Times described her as \"once seen as a British rival to Ginger Rogers.\" According to her obituary in The Independent: \"In the Thirties she was a charming soubrette of light movies and musical comedy. After a break from performing, she emerged in the mid-Forties as a sultry beauty who starred in a series of moody dramas and potent thrillers.\"" ;

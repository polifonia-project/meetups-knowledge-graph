Eisenhower. C. Wesley Roberts (or Wes Roberts) was born in Oskaloosa, Kansas, where he died, the son of Daisy Marian (née Needham) and Francis Henry \"Frank\" Roberts. The Roberts family published the smalltown weekly Oskaloosa Independent for more than a century. Davis Publications currently owns The Oskaloosa Independent. He was the father of U.S. Senator Pat Roberts. Alvin Scott McCoy of The Kansas City Star won a Pulitzer Prize in 1954 for local reporting for a series of articles that drove Roberts to resign his RNC chairmanship. Roberts was accused of collecting a $10,000 commission on the sale of a hospital to the State of Kansas which the state already owned." ;

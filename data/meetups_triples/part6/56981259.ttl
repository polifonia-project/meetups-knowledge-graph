        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edward Anthony Thompson (7 August 1928 â€“ 3 March 2018), known as Anthony Lejeune, was an English writer, editor, and broadcaster. He was known for his weekly radio talk London Letter that was broadcast in South Africa for nearly 30 years and for his crime novels and writing about the history of London's gentleman's clubs. He also produced a number of political books written from a conservative point of view. He was described by The Times as \"always out of period, a misfit in the modern world for whom the term 'young fogey' might have been invented\"." ;

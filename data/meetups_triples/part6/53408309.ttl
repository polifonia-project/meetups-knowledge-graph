Kermani was born into a middle-class educated family in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. She went to the Convent of Jesus and Mary in Karachi. Later she went to London to earn a degree in arts and returned to Pakistan. She realized that women in the Pakistani society were not able to get equality in the society so she started a movement called 'Tehrik-e-Niswan' (Women's Movement) and raised her voice for their rights, health issues, education and equality. Kermani's father was a Retired Brigadier from Pakistan Army and a Chairman of KESC(Karachi Electric Supply Corporation). Her education was at convent schools where her father used to get posted. Kermani started learning Bharatanatyam in the mid-1960s. Her first solo performance was at Pakistan in 1984. In 1988, Sheema proceeded to India on an ICCR (Indian Council of Cultural Relations) scholarship and studied Bharatanatyam under Leela Samson, Kathak under Ram Mohan and Odissi under Guru Mayadhar Raut and Aloka Pannikar. She also conducts theater workshops under the guidance of theater director Prasanna Ramaswamy in Karachi and heads a cultural organization, Tehrik-e-Niswan in Karachi." ;

He was a member of the Jaguars for four seasons before having one season stints with the Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons. Leftwich also played four non-consecutive seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers as the backup to Ben Roethlisberger, where he was part of the Super Bowl-winning team in Super Bowl XLIII. Following his retirement, Leftwich began a coaching career under Bruce Arians with the Arizona Cardinals.

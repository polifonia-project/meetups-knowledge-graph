        mtp:hasAbstract        "Burt Boyar (November 30, 1927 â€“ April 4, 2018) was a Broadway columnist, voice actor, and author. He voiced the title character of Archie Andrews for NBC Radio in 1945 and co-wrote Yes I Can: The Story of Sammy Davis, Jr. with wife Jane Boyar and Davis himself. Boyar's work as a columnist was featured in The Morning Telegraph, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and TV Guide. He reached out to Davis for an interview after Mr. Wonderful opened on Broadway in 1956. They became close friends and after almost a year they began working on the best-selling memoir. Later a follow-up book, Why Me?, was published in 1989. Boyer also compiled a book of photographs taken by Davis, entitled Photo by Sammy Davis Jr, which was published in 2007. Boyer's collection of material relating to Sammy Davis Jr. can be found at the Library of Congress." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sonny Drane (born 13 March 1939) (sometimes erroneously referred to as \"Sonny Freeman Drane\"), is a German-born woman who was briefly popular as a model in Britain in the 1960s. She was propelled to prominence when her first husband, noted British photographer Robert Freeman, included images of her in the first-ever Pirelli Calendar, for which he was the sole photographer. At that time, she was known as Sonny Freeman. She has been married since the 1970s to her second husband, John Drane. In 2008, biographer Philip Norman wrote that Drane was the inspiration for John Lennon's composition \"Norwegian Wood\", recorded by The Beatles in 1965." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kevin Myers (born 30 March 1947) is an English-born Irish journalist and writer. He has contributed to the Irish Independent, the Irish edition of The Sunday Times, and The Irish Times's column \"An Irishman's Diary\". Myers is known for his controversial views on a number of topics, including single mothers, aid for Africa, the Holocaust and Irish nationalism. In July 2017, The Sunday Times announced that Myers would no longer be writing for them following an article he wrote on the BBC gender pay gap, for which he was accused of antisemitism and misogyny, although the chair of the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland stated, \"Branding Kevin Myers as either an antisemite or a Holocaust denier is an absolute distortion of the facts.\"" ;

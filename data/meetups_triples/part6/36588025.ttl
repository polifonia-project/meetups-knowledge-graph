        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alia Bhatt (/ˈɑːliə ˈbʌt/; born 15 March 1993) is a British actress of Indian descent who predominantly works in Hindi films. She has received several accolades including four Filmfare Awards. One of India's highest-paid actresses, she has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2014 and was awarded the TIME100 Impact Award in 2022. Born into the Bhatt family, she is the daughter of filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and actress Soni Razdan. After making her acting debut as a child in the 1999 thriller Sangharsh, she played her first leading role in Karan Johar's teen film Student of the Year (2012). She won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress for playing a kidnapping victim in the road drama Highway (2014), and went on to establish herself with starring roles in several films produced by Johar's studio Dharma Productions, including the romances 2 States (2014) and Badrinath Ki Dulhania (2017), and the coming-of-age drama Dear Zindagi (2016). Bhatt won three Filmfare Awards for Best Actress for playing a Bihari migrant in the crime drama Udta Punjab (2016), an undercover spy in the thriller Raazi (2018), and the volatile girlfriend of an aspiring rapper in the musical drama Gully Boy (2019). Following two poorly received films, she gained praise for playing the titular role in the biopic Gangubai Kathiawadi, had a brief role in the period film RRR, and starred in the fantasy film Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva, all of which rank among the top-grossing Indian films of 2022. In addition to acting in films, Bhatt has launched her own line of clothing and handbags, and is the founder of the ecological initiative CoExist. She has sung seven of her film songs, including the single \"Samjhawan Unplugged\" in 2014. Bhatt is married to the actor Ranbir Kapoor, with whom she has a daughter." ;

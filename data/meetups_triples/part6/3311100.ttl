Wicks was best known as the lead singer-songwriter for the UK rock and power pop band The Records, who formed in London from the ashes of The Kursaal Flyers, during the 1977 punk rock movement. After The Records went their separate ways in 1982, Wicks remained musically active, writing, recording and performing new material, including with several musicians such as Debbi Peterson. The songs of Wicks and his lyricist partner, Will Birch, have been recorded by The Searchers, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Too Much Joy, Michael Monroe, and numerous other artists." ;

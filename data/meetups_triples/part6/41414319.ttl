Amoruso was born in San Diego, California, and moved to Sacramento, California, after High school, soon after relocating to San Francisco.

In 2016, she was named one of the richest self-made women in the world by Forbes. However, Nasty Gal filed for bankruptcy. In 2017, Amoruso founded Girlboss Media, a company that creates content for women in the millennial generation to progress as people in their personal and professional life.

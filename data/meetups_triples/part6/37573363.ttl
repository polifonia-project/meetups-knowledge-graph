        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brandon Eugene Maurer (born July 3, 1990) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres and Kansas City Royals. From Costa Mesa, California, Maurer pitched in Little League Baseball and high school at Orange Lutheran High School. The Mariners selected Maurer in the 23rd round of the 2008 MLB Draft. After being overshadowed by other prospects, Maurer had a strong spring training showing with the Mariners in 2013, and made the team's Opening Day roster in the starting rotation. The Mariners traded Maurer to the Padres after the 2014 season, and he became a relief pitcher. The Padres traded Maurer to the Royals in 2017. Maurer signed a minor league free agent deal with the Pirates during prior to the 2019 season." ;

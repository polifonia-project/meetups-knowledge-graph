        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sally Edwards (born September 10, 1947) is the CEO and Founder of Heart Zones, Inc. She is a best-selling and prolific author, serial entrepreneur, professional triathlete, motivational speaker, innovative app developer and a living legend. Edwards is a pioneer in modern women's sports. She supported and then qualified for the first women's marathon Olympic Trials in 1983. She is one of the original founders of the national governing body of triathlon, USA Triathlon. Edwards has been inducted into two Hall of Fames: the Triathlon Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Sacramento Running Hall of Fame in 2016. She has authored the first books written on subjects including triathlons, training with a heart rate monitor, indoor cycling with wearables, sports snowshoeing, school PE curriculums using wearable devices, and 6 subsequent books on the sport of triathlon. Altogether, Edwards has written 25 books in her effort and her focused mission to get America fit. For twenty-two years, Edwards served as the national spokeswoman for the Danskin Women's Triathlon Series volunteering to finish last as a professional triathlete so that no other woman would have to. Today, she runs the day-to-day of her 25 year old company, Heart Zones after developing the federally patented Heart Zones Training Method. The company currently licenses their technology in 10 countries, almost 2,000 locations including schools, health clubs, and healthcare facilities. Sally resides in Sacramento, California with her partner and her best dog companion, a red healer named Lucy." ;

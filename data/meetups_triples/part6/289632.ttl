        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas James Laughlin (born February 13, 1971), is an American professional wrestler and promoter better known by the ring name Tommy Dreamer. He is signed to Impact Wrestling and is the owner and promoter of the House of Hardcore (HOH) promotion. Dreamer is best known for his tenures with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the 1990s and early 2000s and with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) (previously the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)), primarily from 2001 to 2010. During this time, he held numerous championships including, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship (which he held twice, being the only man to capture the title in both the original ECW and WWE's ECW brand). He has also held the ECW World Tag Team Championship and WWF/E Hardcore Championship. Dubbed the \"heart and soul\" of ECW, Dreamer regularly featured in prominent storylines for the promotion as well as holding a number of back office roles. Dreamer has also appeared for notable promotions such as Impact Wrestling, Ring of Honor (ROH), and AAA. After departing from WWE in 2010, Dreamer joined Impact Wrestling (then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) and was a part of an ECW-inspired stable known as EV 2.0. In 2012, Dreamer started his own wrestling promotion called House of Hardcore, named in honor of ECW's former wrestling school of the same name. Since then, Dreamer has made sporadic appearances with WWE in 2012, 2015, and 2016, as well as wrestling on the independent circuit." ;

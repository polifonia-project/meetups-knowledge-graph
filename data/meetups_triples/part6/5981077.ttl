Previously, he was a military and diplomacy correspondent for The New York Times for 32 years. During the first phase of the Iraq War, he was the only newspaper reporter embedded with the allied land command under General Tommy Franks, a position that \"granted him unique access to cover the invasion strategy and its enactment\". He and General Bernard E. Trainor have written three books together, including the best-selling Cobra II. As journalists for The New York Times, Gordon and Judith Miller were the first to report Saddam Hussein's alleged nuclear weapons program in September 2002 with the article \"U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts.\"" ;

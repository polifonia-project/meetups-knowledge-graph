She has been with the Sun-Times, for over four decades, joining in 1976. Sweet is also a columnist for The Hill and The Huffington Post. She has appeared on CNN and MSNBC as a political analyst and has been a frequent guest on C-SPAN and Charlie Rose. In 2009, Sweet was among the winners of the \"50 Top Journalists\" of the year, chosen by Washingtonian. In naming Sweet, she was described as, \"a one-woman multimedia newsroom who often seems to out-produce whole teams of correspondents.\" During her career, Sweet built a reputation as being committed to accountability in journalism; her philosophy is described in remarks made at 5th annual Washington Women in Journalism Awards, in 2018: \"The most important thing is for journalists to do the job, no matter what platform, and not be distracted by everything going on around you...Get it right, make the extra call, these principles never change. Look up the extra document, just the things that you do every day no matter if it's your first day or your last...A fact is fact.\"" ;

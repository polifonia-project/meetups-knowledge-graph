        mtp:hasAbstract        "Takuma Sato (佐藤 琢磨, Satō Takuma, born 28 January 1977), nicknamed \"Taku\", is a Japanese professional racing driver. Sato is a two time winner of the Indianapolis 500, having won the event in 2017 and 2020. He was the first Asian driver to win the Indianapolis 500, and the twentieth driver to win the race more than once. Before winning the Indianapolis 500, Sato became the first Japanese-born driver to win an IndyCar Series race when he won the 2013 Grand Prix of Long Beach. He currently drives for Dale Coyne Racing with Rick Ware Racing. Sato has raced full-time in the IndyCar Series since 2010 for KV Racing Technology, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, A. J. Foyt Enterprises, and Andretti Autosport, all with Honda engines. He competed in Formula One from 2002 to 2008 for the Honda-powered Jordan, BAR and Super Aguri teams, scoring 44 points overall, and a single podium which was at the 2004 United States Grand Prix. His 8th-place finish in the 2004 Formula One World Drivers' Championship is the best-ever result for a Japanese driver in the series. Sato has become known among fans and media for his motto \"no attack, no chance\" with regards to his racing style." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "LaTavia Marie Roberson (born November 1, 1981) is an American R&B singer. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as an original member of the R&B group Destiny's Child, one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. During her time as a member, Roberson recorded two studio albums, sold over 25 million records and won two Grammy Awards and three Soul Train Music Awards. Following her departure from the group, Roberson formed Anjel along with former Destiny's Child member LeToya Luckett. After their album was shelved, Roberson went on hiatus and returned to Houston. Roberson has starred in various stage plays including Those Jeans, How to Love, and Not My Family. Roberson also became a main cast-member for R&B Divas: Atlanta alongside singers such as Angie Stone, Keke Wyatt and long-time friend Meelah of 702." ;

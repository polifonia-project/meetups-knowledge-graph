        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Frederick Schreiber (October 8, 1902 â€“ January 28, 1982) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball. He pitched in ten games for the Brooklyn Robins during the 1922 and 1923 baseball season. He returned to the major leagues as a batting practice pitcher and coach for the New York Yankees. In 1945, while he was coaching for the Yanks, he briefly came out of retirement to pitch in two more games when the staff was depleted due to World War II. His span of 22 years and 2 days between consecutive major league appearances remains an MLB record. Schreiber then was a coach for the Boston Red Sox for 13 seasons, from 1946 to 1958, and scouted for them during the 1960s." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sanne Keizer (born 6 February 1985) is a Dutch beach volleyball player who plays as a right-side defender with her partner Madelein Meppelink. Her career highlights include two gold, two silver and four bronze medals on the FIVB World Tour. She is a two-time European Champion and she represented the Netherlands at the 2012 Summer Olympics, finishing ninth with Marleen van Iersel. Keizer took up indoor volleyball at the age of 11 and spent several years playing in the Dutch volleyball leagues. She competed in her first international beach volleyball event in 2002 and became the inaugural U18 World Champion the same year. Keizer debuted on the World Tour the following year. For the next eight seasons, she had limited international success competing with three different partners. Her breakthrough came at the end of 2008 when she teamed up with van Iersel. The pair entered the top ten of the world rankings the year after and medalled on the World Tour five times in total, including their first World Tour title in 2011. They continued to play together until Keizer retired from beach volleyball at the end of 2013. After a four-year hiatus, Keizer returned to full-time competition partnered with Meppelink. Having been a blocker in the first leg of her career, she came back as a defender instead. Keizer and Meppelink found success quickly, medalling on the World Tour twice in their first season together and winning the 2018 European Championships." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Crawford Lochary (August 21, 1944 â€“ July 29, 1977) was an American actor, one of the regular \"Dreamlander\" actors in early films of the controversial \"trash\" film director John Waters. He starred in such films as Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, and Multiple Maniacs, in which he typically played exotically-dressed, sophisticated perverts. Lochary co-wrote The Diane Linkletter Story with Divine, and worked as an uncredited hair and makeup artist on many of Waters' films. Lochary met Divine at beauty school and used to style his wigs and makeup for parties. Divine later commented that he had \"never even heard the word 'drag' before David.\"" ;

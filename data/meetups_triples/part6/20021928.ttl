        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Kieran Harvey (born 7 July 1961) is an Australian pianist and composer whose career has been notable for its diversity and wide repertoire. He is renowned for commissioning, performing and composing new music. He has especially promoted the works of Australian composers, such as Carl Vine, most of whose piano music he has recorded and much of which was written for him. He is also particularly associated with the piano music of Olivier Messiaen. According to critic Clive O'Connell in The Age: \"Few Australian pianists can touch Michael Kieran Harvey, one of the most exciting exponents of contemporary music in the country\"." ;

Born in Ancona, Amurri was author of some of the most popular RAI variety shows, such as Canzonissima, Gran Varietà, Fantastico and Studio Uno. He was also author of fourteen books, several of them best sellers, which were mainly collections of short stories consisting of satirical portraits of collapsing family groups.

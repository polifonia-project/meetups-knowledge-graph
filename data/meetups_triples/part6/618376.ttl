        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elisha Nelson Manning (born January 3, 1981) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons with the New York Giants. A member of the Manning football dynasty, he is the youngest son of quarterback Archie Manning and younger brother of quarterback Peyton Manning. Manning played college football at Ole Miss, where he won the Maxwell and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Awards as a senior. He was selected first overall in the 2004 NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers and traded to the Giants during the draft. Although Manning struggled with consistency throughout much of his career, he is recognized for twice leading the Giants to underdog Super Bowl victories against the New England Patriots' dynasty in Super Bowl XLII and Super Bowl XLVI. The former, which saw the wild card Giants defeat a Patriots team that was the first to win all 16 regular season games, is regarded as one of the greatest sports upsets of all time. Manning was named Most Valuable Player in both championships, making him one of five players to have multiple Super Bowl MVP awards. As the Giants' starting quarterback from 2004 to 2019, Manning holds the franchise records for passing yards, touchdown passes, and completions. Never missing a game due to injury, he started 210 consecutive games from 2004 to 2017, the third-longest consecutive starts streak by an NFL quarterback. Manning ranks eighth all-time in passing yards and ninth in touchdowns." ;

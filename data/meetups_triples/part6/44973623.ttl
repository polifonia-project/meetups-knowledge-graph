He was Professor of Flute at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and Supervisor of School (Flute) Bands with the New South Wales Department of Education. He is credited with introducing the flute and recorder to New South Wales schools, greatly increasing the popularity of the flute to generations of students around the state. Among the professional flautists he taught were Don Burrows, Margaret Crawford, Linda Vogt, Jane Rutter, Peter Richardson, Geoffrey Collins, and Mark Underwood. The Victor McMahon Music Centre at St. Kevin's College, Melbourne is named after him." ;

She is recognised as the country's “Comedy Princess” for her wit, humor, and energy that made her one of the pillars of Philippine entertainment. Quinto is a ten-time Best Comedy Actress winner at the PMPC Star Awards for Television, setting the record with more wins than any other artist in the category. She also earned a nomination at the prestigious FAMAS Awards in the 'Best Actress' category. The Philippine Star listed her as one of the \"greatest comedians of all time\", stating that \"she is the best\" among her contemporaries. In 2019, she was honored with an Award of Distinction by the Red & Black Gala Awards, recognizing her prowess as an actress and performer as a whole. Quinto has made an undeniable mark on Philippine pop culture, with her unforgettable signature lines in some of her iconic films, such as the famous “Todo na ‘to!” and “Go! Go!

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Summer Lynn Lee (born November 26, 1987) is an American community organizer and politician serving as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 34th district. With the support of the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, she defeated incumbent Paul Costa in the 2018 Democratic primary election with over 67% of the vote. Lee is the first black woman to represent Southwestern Pennsylvania in the state legislature. Lee was the Democratic nominee in the 2022 election to represent Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. She won the primary by less than 1% of the vote over her closest opponent, Steve Irwin, the chair of the State Advisory Committee for the United States Commission on Civil Rights. She won the general election, and will become the first Black woman from Pennsylvania in the House of Representatives." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sara Jordan Powell (born October 6, 1938) is an American gospel musician. Her first works, \"Touch Somebody's Life\" and \"When Jesus Comes,\" were released in 1972, and got significant radio airtime. She released an album that was produced by James Cleveland, \"Touch Somebody's Life,\" which came out in 1975 on Savoy Records. Powell released four more albums on that label: 1980's \"I Must Tell Jesus\", 1990's \"Sara Jordan Powell\" and \"When Jesus Comes to Stay,\" and 1995's \"The Soul of Sara Jordan Powell.\" Subsequently, she released one album with Compendia Music Group that same year, \"Live in Houston.\" Her music has even been performed at the White House—in 1979 for President Jimmy Carter; she was joined by Chuck Berry, Billy Eckstine, Evelyn \"Champagne\" King, and Andraé Crouch. President Ronald Reagan appointed her to serve on the Year of the Bible Committee. She later took the opportunity to minister to President Bill Clinton in Memphis, Tennessee, along with saxophonist Dr. Vernard Johnson, at the request of Bishop Louis Henry Ford, who was then presiding Bishop of the Church of God in Christ (www.cogic.org/)." ;

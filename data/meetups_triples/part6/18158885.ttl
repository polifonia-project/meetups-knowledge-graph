He was found still living days later in the stomach of the whale, which was dead from harpooning. The story originated of an anonymous form, began to appear in American newspapers. The anonymous article appeared in the St. Louis Globe Democrat of Saint Louis, Missouri, then the note appeared in other newspapers with the title \"A Modern Jonah\" or something similar in multiple newspapers. The news spread beyond the ocean in articles as \"Man in a Whale's Stomach. \"Rescue of a Modern Jonah\" in page 8 of the August 22, 1891, issue of the Yarmouth Mercury newspaper of Great Yarmouth in England." ;

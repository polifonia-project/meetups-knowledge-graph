        mtp:hasAbstract        "Siren Sundby (born 2 December 1982 in LÃ¸renskog) is a former Norwegian sailor. She won an Olympic gold medal in the Europe-class in the 2004 Summer Olympics. She also won the world championships in the Europe-class in 2003 and 2004. Sundby was selected female sailor of the year by the International Sailing Federation in 2003. Sundby revealed in July 2006 that she was giving up sailing. Since her sailing partner became pregnant and gave up sailing, Sundby had been looking for a new partner, but then decided that there was not enough time to prepare with a new partner before the 2008 Summer Olympics, and still have a realistic chance of winning gold." ;

Hardman's thirteen-year professional football career lasted from 1970 to 1981 in the National Football League and ended as a player/coach in 1983 with the USFL's Oakland Invaders. Hardman held the record for most sacks in a season for the 49ers recording 18 sacks in only 14 games during his 1971 Pro Bowl season with the 49ers until 2012, when it was broken by Aldon Smith with 19.5." ;

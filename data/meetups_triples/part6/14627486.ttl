He is the third son of actor Kirk Douglas, and the first by his second wife, German-American producer Anne Buydens. Douglas worked closely with his father and became president of The Bryna Company, an independent film and television production company formed by Kirk Douglas in 1949. In 1978, he formed his own film production company, Vincent Pictures. Douglas won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special in 1988 for his production of Inherit the Wind, which co-starred his father and Jason Robards. He had been nominated for the same award two years prior for his production of Amos, which also starred his father." ;

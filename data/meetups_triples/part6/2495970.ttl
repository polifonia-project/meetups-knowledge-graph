He is the founding mainstay guitarist, songwriter, and lead vocalist of the rockabilly band The Living End, which was formed in 1994 with schoolmate Scott Owen. Cheney wrote the group's top 20 hits on the ARIA Singles Chart: \"Second Solution\" / \"Prisoner of Society\" (1997), \"All Torn Down\" (1999), \"Pictures in the Mirror\" (2000), \"Roll On\" (2001), \"One Said to the Other\" (2003), \"What's on Your Radio\" (2005), \"Wake Up\" (2006), and \"White Noise\" (2008). In 2004, Cheney joined the supergroup The Wrights which put out a cover version of Stevie Wright's epic 11-minute track, \"Evie\" as a single. At the 2009 APRA Music Awards, Cheney won Song of the Year for writing The Living End's track, \"White Noise\". In 2005, he married his girlfriend Emma; the couple has two daughters and are co-owners of a recording facility, Red Door Sounds. In 2011, the Cheney family relocated to Los Angeles." ;

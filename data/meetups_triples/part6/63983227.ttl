        mtp:hasAbstract        "On 22 March 2020, 7-year-old Emily Grace Jones was stabbed at Queen's Park in Bolton, Greater Manchester, England, while riding her scooter and died shortly afterwards. Eltiona Skana, a 30-year-old Albanian woman unknown to the Jones family, was arrested on the scene and later charged with murder. Skana pleaded guilty to the lesser included offence of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility on 6 November 2020. After a trial at Minshull Street Crown Court from 26 November to 4 December, the charge of murder was withdrawn by the prosecution and the jury was directed to formally return a not guilty verdict for murder. On 8 December, she was given a life sentence, with a minimum term of eight years, for the conviction of manslaughter. On 26 January 2021, Skana's minimum sentence was increased to 10 years and eight months, with the presiding judge stating the previous minimum sentence had been \"calculated in error\"." ;

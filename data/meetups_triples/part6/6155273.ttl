He played defense in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Philadelphia Flyers and the Elitserien with Djurgårdens IF and Västerås IK. On October 16, 1983, Eriksson scored a goal 32 seconds into a game played on his birthday. It established an NHL record for the earliest goal by a player on his birthday. The record was broken in 2009 by Tim Jackman of the New York Islanders." ;

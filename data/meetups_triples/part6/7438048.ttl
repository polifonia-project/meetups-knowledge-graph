        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Lyman Fair (October 27, 1932 â€“ February 2018) was an American writer and sculptor. He was known for his experimental and versatile literary forms, most prominently through the 1966 novel Hog Butcher, set in 1960s Chicago. This was the basis of the 1975 film Cornbread, Earl and Me. The cast included Rosalind Cash and Laurence Fishburne. Relocating to Finland, Fair began sculpting in 1977. In December 1980 he became \"born again\", thereafter becoming a \"Christian writer\" and founder of the International Orphans' Assistance Association." ;

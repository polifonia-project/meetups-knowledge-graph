        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ana Alicia Guerra Morales (born 18 February 1994), better known as Ana Guerra, is a Spanish singer. She rose to prominence when she took part in series nine of the reality television talent competition Operación Triunfo, where she finished in fifth place. She was a candidate to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, with two songs, \"El remedio\", and a duet with fellow contestant Aitana Ocaña entitled \"Lo malo\". Finally, neither was selected to represent the country in the European contest, while \"Lo malo\" did get to represent Spain at the OGAE Second Chance Contest. \"Lo malo\", which was voted in third place with 26%, reached the top of the Spanish chart and obtained a quintuple platinum certification with 180,000 digital purchases. After her departure from Operación Triunfo 2017, Guerra collaborated with Juan Magán on the song \"Ni la hora\". In its first week of release, it reached number one on the Spanish songs chart. It was later certified triple platinum in Spain. Her single \"Bajito\" was also certified gold. In 2018 she became the second Spanish female artist in history to have two songs over 30 million streams on Spotify Spain. The digital newspaper El Español considers her to be one of the most successful contestants of Operación Triunfo." ;

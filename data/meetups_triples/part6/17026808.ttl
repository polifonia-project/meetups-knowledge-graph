        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zelia Trebelli-Bettini (1836–1892) also known as Zelia Gilbert or by her stage name Trebelli, was a French operatic mezzo-soprano. Born in Paris, she died in Etretat.Mme Trebelli's artistry was greatly admired by George Bernard Shaw, who wrote about her a number of times in his various reviews. In particular, he admired her interpretations and her exemplary English diction, rare for a non-native English speaker. Her daughter Antonia (originally Antoinette) Dolores Trebelli (c. 1864 – ) was a distinguished soprano, and as \"Mademoiselle Dolores\" was well received in Australia and New Zealand." ;

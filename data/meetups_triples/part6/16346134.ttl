Bhargava's short film Sangam, described by Greg Tate of the Village Voice as \"an elegant and poetic evocation of immigrant angst, memory and haunted spirituality\", premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and PBS. His other directorial efforts include the documentary portrait of his grandmother Ammaji, experimental Super 8 short Backwaters and the poignant and meditative Kashmir, an audiovisual performance with band Dawn of Midi Bhargava's feature-length directorial debut, (2012) was premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival and Tribeca Film Festival.

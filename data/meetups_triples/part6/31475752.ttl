His earliest published books were collections of poetry, but prose writing has become a larger part of his output since the critical and commercial success of his first novel Der Verlorene (translated into English as Lost). Treichel has also worked as an opera librettist, most prominently in collaboration with the composer Hans Werner Henze." ;

His minor league career extended though 1981. He attended Tampa Catholic High School in Tampa, FL and was selected in the 6th round of the 1973 June Amateur Baseball Draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. In January 1982, Seoane surrendered himself to police authorities along with fellow former MLB pitcher Mark Lemongello, for the kidnapping and robbery of Lemongello's cousins Mike Lemongello, a former professional bowler, and Peter Lemongello, a cabaret- / pop-singer. Seoane and Mark Lemongello were both sentenced to seven years probation after they both pleaded no contest to the charges." ;

He was the original host of The Hollywood Squares from 1966 to 1981 and has almost fifty television, movie, and Broadway credits. Marshall was given his stage name by John Robert Powers. Powers had chosen the last name Marshall for Peter's sister (who later chose to use Joanne Dru instead), and Peter adopted it early in his career and paired it with an anglicized version of his middle name." ;

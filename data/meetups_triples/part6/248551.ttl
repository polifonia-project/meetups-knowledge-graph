        mtp:hasAbstract        "Corey Ian Haim (December 23, 1971 â€“ March 10, 2010) was a Canadian actor. He starred in a number of 1980s films, such as Lucas, Silver Bullet, Murphy's Romance, License to Drive and Dream a Little Dream. His role alongside Corey Feldman in The Lost Boys made him a household name. Known as The Two Coreys, the duo became 1980s icons and appeared together in seven films, later starring in the A&E American reality show The Two Coreys. Haim's early success led to money and fame. He had difficulty breaking away from the trauma of his experience as a child actor and was troubled by drug addiction throughout his adult life. He died of pneumonia on March 10, 2010." ;

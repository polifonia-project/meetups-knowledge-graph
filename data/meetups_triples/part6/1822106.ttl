Novelist Dennis Cooper has described Myles as \"one of the savviest and most restless intellects in contemporary literature.\" The Boston Globe described them as \"that rare creature, a rock star of poetry.\" In 2012, Myles received a Guggenheim Fellowship to complete Afterglow (a memoir), which gives both a real and fantastic account of a dog's life. Myles uses they/them pronouns." ;

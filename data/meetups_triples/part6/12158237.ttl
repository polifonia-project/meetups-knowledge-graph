        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Mullen (born 1964) is a former Blues Pop / CCM singer, songwriter and musician. Later he became well known as a songwriter, music producer, and film score composer. He released his first album in 1989, and won the GMA Dove Award for New Artist of the Year in 1990. He later recorded his last album in 1994. Since then, he has written and produced recordings for several other Christian artists, most notably Nicole C. Mullen. David and Nicole shared the 1998 Dove Award for Song of the Year (along with Michael Ochs) for writing the song \"On My Knees\" for Jaci Velasquez; Nicole later included the song on her own album. The couple divorced in 2014. He wrote songs to Jonah: A Veggie Tales Movie and made the music for Chris Olsen's Threads: A Pond Full of Pigs. Most recently Mullen has been restoring an old recording studio in the historic district of Franklin, TN (Emack Studio) that he purchased with CCM veteran Toby McKeehan (Toby Mac, DC Talk), and which is now the headquarters of the artist relations department of Yamaha International." ;

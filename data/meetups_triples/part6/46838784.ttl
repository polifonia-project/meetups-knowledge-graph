        mtp:hasAbstract        "Suleika Jaouad (/suːˈlaɪkə dʒəˈwɑːd/ soo-LAY-kə jə-WAHD; Arabic: سليكة جواد) is an American writer, advocate, and motivational speaker. She is the author of the \"Life, Interrupted\" column in The New York Times and has also written for Vogue, Glamour, NPR's All Things Considered and Women's Health. Her 2021 memoir Between Two Kingdoms was a New York Times Best Seller. When Jaouad was diagnosed with a rare form of acute myeloid leukemia in 2011, doctors said she had only a 35% chance of surviving. She survived and has written and spoken extensively about her medical experiences. Her Emmy Award-winning column, \"Life, Interrupted\" was part of the New York Times Well blog. In December 2021, Jaouad announced her cancer had returned and that she had undergone a second bone marrow transplant." ;

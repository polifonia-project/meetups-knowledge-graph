While playing college football at the United States Military Academy, he gained national prominence as the \"Lonesome End\" of the Army football team. During his military service in the Vietnam War, he again achieved fame when he saved his company by directing airstrikes on his own position. For the action, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross." ;

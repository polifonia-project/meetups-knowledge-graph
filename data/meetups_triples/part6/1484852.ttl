        mtp:hasAbstract        "Grigori Naumovich Voitinsky, born Zarkhin (Russian: Григорий Наумович Войтинский; 17 April 1893 – 11 June 1953) was a Soviet Comintern official. He was sent to China in 1920 as a senior advisor to contact the top prominent Chinese communists such as Chen Duxiu, just before the formation of the Communist Party of China. The process of forming the Communist Party can be mostly attributed to his influence, although his successor advisors had more influence about the official party line itself, such as allying with the Kuomintang. He was born on 17 April 1893 in Nevel to a Russian Jewish family. In 1918, he joined the Bolshevik Party. He took an active part in the Far Eastern Front in the Russian Civil War." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Attie was a prominent American photographer, widely published in magazines and books from the late 1950s until his passing in the 1980s. He was one of the last great proteges of legendary photography teacher and art director Alexey Brodovitch. Attie worked in a wide range of styles, illustrating everything from novels to magazine and album covers to subway posters, and taking now-iconic portraits of Truman Capote, Bobby Fischer, Lorraine Hansberry, and many others. He also created the first-ever visual depiction of Holly Golightly, the main character in Breakfast at Tiffany's, when he illustrated the Capote novella's first appearance in Esquire Magazine. He was best known in his lifetime for his signature photo montagesâ€”an approach he called \"multiple-image photography\": highly inventive, pre-Photoshop collages that he made by combining negatives in the darkroom. His work has received new attention with a pair of posthumous books: the well-reviewed 2015 publication of his Capote collaboration \"Brooklyn: A Personal Memoir, With The Lost Photographs of David Attie,\" and the 2021 collection of his behind-the-scenes photographs from the very first season of Sesame Street, \"The Unseen Photos of Street Gang.\" He has been the subject of several solo exhibits in recent years, including a two-year retrospective at the Brooklyn Historical Society. One recent critic wrote that even decades later, \"his explorations of photomontage remain durably inspired, innovative, and visually dynamic.\"" ;

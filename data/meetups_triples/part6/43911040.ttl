        mtp:hasAbstract        "Derrick Deshaun Watson (born September 14, 1995) is an American football quarterback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Clemson, where he led the team to a national championship in 2016. Watson was selected in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft by the Houston Texans. After having a productive rookie season cut short by injury, Watson guided the Texans to consecutive division titles in 2018 and 2019 and led the league in passing yards in 2020. He also received Pro Bowl honors in each of his three seasons as Houston's primary starter. He has the highest career completion percentage of all time (minimum 1,500 attempts), and is second in all-time career passer rating. Beginning in 2021, Watson has been sued by more than two dozen female massage therapists for sexual harassment and sexual assault. Watson has denied any wrongdoing despite settling 20 claims of sexual misconduct. Disagreements with the Texans' front office and multiple sexual-misconduct lawsuits kept Watson out for the entire 2021 season and eventually led to a trade to the Cleveland Browns. In 2022 he signed a five-year contract worth $230 million, one of the most expensive contracts in NFL history." ;

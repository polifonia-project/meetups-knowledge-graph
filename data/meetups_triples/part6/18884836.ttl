        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jose Baxter (born 7 February 1992) is an English former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. Born in Bootle, Baxter began his career with his home town club of Everton, where in 2008 he became the Premier League's then-second youngest ever starter at 16 years 191 days (Matthew Briggs of Fulham held the record – 16 years 68 days – from 2007 until it was surpassed in 2019 by Harvey Elliott). After having been on the fringes of the first team and spending time on loan at Tranmere Rovers, he rejected a new contract in 2012 in order to find regular football elsewhere. He joined Oldham Athletic shortly afterwards, where he spent a successful season before being bought by Sheffield United just under 12 months later. After a three-year period in Yorkshire interrupted by suspensions, he was released and had a spell without a club before Everton signed him again in 2017 to rebuild his career in their reserve squad. He returned to Oldham in the summer of 2018. In July 2019, he signed for Plymouth Argyle, and left them in November 2019. Baxter represented England at both under-16 and under-17 level." ;

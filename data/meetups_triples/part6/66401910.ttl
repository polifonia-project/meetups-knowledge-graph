        mtp:hasAbstract        "Keith Patrick Gill (born 1986) is an American financial analyst and investor known for his posts on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets. His analyses of GameStop stock, and details of his resulting investment gains—posted on Reddit under the username DeepFuckingValue (DFV) and on YouTube and Twitter as Roaring Kitty—were cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021, and as a spark for the subsequent trading frenzy in retail stocks. The rising stock value allowed Gill to turn a US$53,000 investment into one worth close to $50 million (as of January 28, 2021). Gill's posts were described as \"forthright, spreadsheet-laden content\". His Reddit username derives from the investing term deep value, as Gill claims to be a proponent of value investing. Reuters revealed his identity to the public on January 28, 2021, after an investigation of public records and social-media posts. Gill gave testimony as part of a virtual hearing held by the US House Financial Services Committee on February 18, 2021 as part of a discussion about when \"short sellers, social media, and retail investors collide\". Gill testified he \"did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for [his] own profit.\"" ;

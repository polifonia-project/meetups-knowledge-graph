        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ela Orleans (born 1971 in Oświęcim, commonly known by its German name of Auschwitz) is a Polish composer, multi-instrumentalist and singer. Orleans uses electronic and acoustic instruments (including synthesisers, guitar, violin, piano) to create a diverse and layered music. She performs as both a musician and DJ (the latter often under the alias Tract). Her work as a songwriter in many instances uses 1950s and 1960s pop as its basis, by way of everything from electronica to Éthiopiques (the CD series of 1960s and 1970s Ethiopian music), from Polish folk to Bernard Herrmann's film scores for Alfred Hitchcock. Orleans is based in London, after years in New York, Warsaw and Glasgow. Various independent labels around the world since 2008 have released her solo studio albums, as well as compilations, mixes and collaborations with artists such as Dirty Beaches, U.S. Girls and The Pastels. Orleans has scored music for TV, film, and opera. She has toured and made festival appearances across the UK, Europe and North America. She has played live and had her work presented internationally in galleries such as Tate Britain. Orleans describes her music as \"movies for ears\". She consistently receives international acclaim from the fringe, art and mainstream worlds. Q magazine acknowledges Ela Orleans' \"prolific track record on the fringes of experimental music, both as a sound collagist and film composer\" (May 2015). Uncut magazine has lauded Ela Orleans for her \"beautifully confusing solo albums\" (October 2013). The Wire magazine asserted that Orleans' \"spectral pop enchants and disturbs, revealing new secrets with each listen\" (September 2016). Thurston Moore in the Mojo magazine review of 2014 remarked on Ela Orleans' \"astounding soundscapes, though it's her beautiful voice that really galvanises the music. … The best thing I've heard all year.\" Other noted supporters of Orleans' music include film director Miranda July, the late DJ Andrew Weatherall, singer-songwriter Tim Burgess, director David Lynch, author Ian Rankin and indie group The Pastels." ;

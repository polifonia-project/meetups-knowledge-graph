        mtp:hasAbstract        "Smoky Dawson AM, MBE (19 March 1913 â€“ 13 February 2008), born as Herbert Henry Brown, was an Australian Country, Western and folk performer, radio star, entertainer, and icon. He was widely touted as Australia's first singing cowboy complete with acoustic steel string guitar and yodel, in the style of American's Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. Dawson had an extraordinarily long and prolific career, releasing his first single in 1941 and his last album in 2005, aged 92. Through his high-rating syndicated radio serials (at their height broadcast on 100 stations), \"The Adventures of Smoky Dawson\", as well as television appearances, comic books and songs he created the persona of a happy-go-lucky singing cowboy. Dawson did his own version of Wild Colonial Boy, rewriting the words and music with American country singer Glen Campbell. Dawson also met The Kelly Family, and wrote a ditty about Jim Kelly, the brother of Ned Kelly." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sir John Cope KB MP (July 1688 â€“ 28 July 1760) was a British soldier, and Whig Member of Parliament, representing three separate constituencies between 1722 and 1741. He is now chiefly remembered for his defeat at Prestonpans, the first significant battle of the Jacobite rising of 1745 and which was commemorated by the tune \"Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet?\", which still features in modern Scottish folk music and bagpipe recitals. His military service included the wars of the Spanish and Austrian Successions. Like many of the senior officers present at Dettingen in 1743, victory resulted in promotion, and he was appointed military commander in Scotland shortly before the 1745 Rising. Although exonerated by a court-martial in 1746, Prestonpans ended his career as a field officer. In 1751, he was appointed governor of the Limerick garrison, and deputy to Viscount Molesworth, commander of the army in Ireland. He died in London on 28 July 1760." ;

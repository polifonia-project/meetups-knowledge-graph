        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Aaron Smith (February 28, 1945 – August 3, 2011), commonly known as Bubba Smith, was an American football defensive end and actor. He first came into prominence at Michigan State University, where he twice earned All-American honors on the Spartans football team. Smith had a major role in a 10–10 tie with Notre Dame in 1966 that was billed as \"The Game of the Century.\" He is one of only six players to have his jersey number retired by the program. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988. The first selection of the 1967 NFL/AFL draft, Smith played nine years in the National Football League (NFL) with the Baltimore Colts (1967–1971), Oakland Raiders (1973–1974), and Houston Oilers (1975–1976). He was the Colts' starting left defensive end for five seasons, playing in Super Bowls III and V. He was named to two Pro Bowls and was a First-team All-Pro in 1971. He had tremendous quickness despite being 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) and 265 pounds (120 kg), a combination which usually earned him a double-team. During his acting career, Smith specialized in comedic roles in film, television, and television advertising. For about a decade following his retirement from football, he appeared in various commercials for Miller Lite. His best-known role was as Moses Hightower in the first six Police Academy movies. Smith was posthumously diagnosed with CTE, a neurological condition generally related to concussion and sub-concussive head trauma." ;

Like his father, he was the proprietor of the large London brewery H. Thrale & Co. Born at the Alehouse in Harrow Corner, Southwark, he was the son of the rich brewer (1698–1758) and Mary Thrale. He married Hester Lynch Salusbury on 11 October 1763; they had 12 children, and she outlived him. He was MP for Southwark 23 December 1765 – September 1780, an Alderman, and Sheriff of the City of London: a respected, religious man who was a good hunter and sportsman with a taste for gambling." ;

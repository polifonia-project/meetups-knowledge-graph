        mtp:hasAbstract        "Derek Boshier (born 1937, in Portsmouth) is an English artist, among the first proponents of British pop art. He works in various media including painting, drawing, collage, and sculpture. In the 1970s he shifted from painting to photography, film, video, assemblage, and installations, but he returned to painting by the end of the decade. Addressing the question of what shapes his work, Boshier once stated \"Most important is life itself, my sources tend to be current events, personal events, social and political situations, and a sense of place and places\". His work uses popular culture and the mixing of high and low culture to confront government, revolution, sex, technology and war with subversive dark humor. He has been commissioned by David Bowie, The Clash, and The Pretty Things." ;

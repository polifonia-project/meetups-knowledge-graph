        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ryan Tubridy (born 28 May 1973), nicknamed 'Fletch' is an Irish broadcaster. He presents The Ryan Tubridy Show and The Late Late Show. Tubridy previously presented RTÉ 2fm breakfast radio show The Full Irish, which at its end was the second most popular radio programme in Ireland. For five seasons from 2004 until 2009, he presented the Saturday night TV chat show Tubridy Tonight on RTÉ One. He later left RTÉ 2fm for a number of years to present The Tubridy Show on RTÉ Radio 1, but returned to RTÉ 2fm in 2010 to present a weekday morning radio show from 09:00 to 11:00, following the termination of The Gerry Ryan Show with the presenter's sudden death. He has also hosted the Rose of Tralee contest on two occasions. As part of a two-book deal with HarperCollins—and in a nod to his passion for U.S. politics—Tubridy penned JFK in Ireland, a profile of U.S. President John F. Kennedy's 1963 visit to Ireland. Tubridy's second book, The Irish Are Coming, about the influence of Irish people in the UK, was published in 2013. With several wins and nominations at the Meteor Awards to his name, dating from his time as host of The Full Irish, Tubridy was named one of ten \"icons\" of 21st century Ireland by the Sunday Tribune's Derek O'Connor in 2008." ;

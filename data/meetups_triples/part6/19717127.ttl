        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nathan Rabin (/rɑːˈbiːn/; born April 24, 1976) is an American film and music critic. Rabin was the first head writer for The A.V. Club, a position he held until he left the Onion organization in 2013. In 2013, Rabin became a staff writer for The Dissolve, a film website operated by Pitchfork Media. Two of his featured columns at The Dissolve were \"Forgotbusters\" (looking back at films that were among the top 25 box office earners in their release years but had not had cultural or popular endurance) and \"Streaming University\" (reviewing documentaries that were available through sites such as Netflix and Hulu). On April 29, 2015, Rabin announced he had parted ways with The Dissolve. He later returned to The A.V. Club as a freelance writer. In April 2017, Nathan announced that The AV Club had canceled his My World of Flops column, and that he was establishing his own Patreon-funded website, Nathan Rabin's Happy Place." ;

He was best known for his novels, including A Long Day's Dying, The Book of Bebb, Godric (1981 Pulitzer Prize finalist), and Brendan, his memoirs, including The Sacred Journey and Telling Secrets, and his theological works, such as Secrets in the Dark, The Magnificent Defeat, and Telling the Truth. Buechner was named \"without question one of the truly great writers of the 20th century\" by viaLibri, a \"major talent\" by The New York Times, and \"one of our most original storytellers\" by USA Today. Annie Dillard (Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek) called him \"one of our finest writers.\" Buechner's works are often compared to C.S. Lewis and G.K. Chesterton. His works have been translated into many languages.

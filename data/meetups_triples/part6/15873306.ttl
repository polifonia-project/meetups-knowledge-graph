        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marie-Nicole Lemieux, C.M., C.Q. (born June 26, 1975) is a Canadian coloratura contralto. In 2000, she became the first Canadian to win first prize at the Queen Elizabeth International Music Competition in Belgium. Lemieux has continued to perform classical music, appearing with various orchestras and opera companies. Lemieux possesses an unusually flexible contralto voice lacking the heaviness that is often associated with her particular voice type. Lemieux frequently performs Baroque opera including operas of Handel and Vivaldi. Her voice is admired for its richness, warmth and resonance and for its expressiveness and use of many different tone colors. Lemieux is also praised by critics for her stage presence and communicative power." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nicholas Donabet Kristof (born April 27, 1959) is an American journalist and political commentator. A winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, he is a regular CNN contributor and an op-ed columnist for The New York Times. Born in Chicago, Kristof was raised in the rural community of Yamhill, Oregon, the son of two professors at Portland State University. After graduating from Harvard University, where he wrote for The Harvard Crimson, Kristof intermittently interned at The Oregonian. He joined the staff of The New York Times in 1984. Kristof is a self-described progressive. According to The Washington Post, Kristof \"rewrote opinion journalism\" with his emphasis on human rights abuses and social injustices, such as human trafficking and the Darfur conflict. Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa described Kristof as an \"honorary African\" for shining a spotlight on neglected conflicts in the continent." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andre Dow (known by his stage name Mac Minister) is a former American rapper. Mac Minister was profiled on an episode of America's Most Wanted, allegedly responsible for the murder of Anthony \"Fat-Tone\" Watkins in Las Vegas, Nevada, in retaliation for the murder of Bay Area hip-hop icon Mac Dre. After a 10-month manhunt, Mac was apprehended by Andrew Thirlaway on the evening of March 2, 2006 while hiding out in a San Francisco apartment, becoming AMW Direct Result Capture #879. Mac Minister is from San Francisco, California, the Fillmore District - a neighborhood also known as \"The Fillmore\", \"FILLMOE\", and \"the Moe\". He lived in the Marcus Garvey/Martin Luther King Jr housing complex and his apartment was entered in two police raids in 1999, one in which his pitbull was shot and killed by the police officers." ;

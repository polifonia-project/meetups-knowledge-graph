        mtp:hasAbstract        "Fred Brathwaite (born August 31, 1959), more popularly known as Fab 5 Freddy, is an American visual artist, filmmaker, and hip hop pioneer. He is considered one of the architects of the street art movement. Freddy emerged in New York's downtown underground creative scene in the late 1970s as a graffiti artist. He was the bridge between the burgeoning uptown rap scene and the downtown No Wave art scene. He was immortalized in 1981 when Debbie Harry rapped on the Blondie song \"Rapture\" that \"Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody's fly.\" In the late 1980s, Freddy became the first host of the groundbreaking hip-hop music video show Yo! MTV Raps." ;

Winner of the 2008 Thelonious Monk Jazz Competition and one of Time Out's \"25 essential New York City jazz icons\", Irabagon is known for the breadth of his work on a jazz continuum ranging \"from postbop to free improvisation, avant country to doom metal\". His \"extraordinary eclecticism\" has led to performances with such diverse artists as Wynton Marsalis, Lou Reed, Evan Parker, Billy Joel, the Maria Schneider Orchestra, Bertha Hope, Herbie Hancock, Conor Oberst, Christian McBride, Mike Pride, Kenny Barron, Darcy James Argue's Secret Society, Bill Laswell, Peter Evans, Tyshawn Sorey, Ingrid Laubrock, Ava Mendoza, Mick Barr, and Tom Rainey. Irabagon's many projects as bandleader include a quartet with Luis Perdomo, Yasushi Nakamura, and Rudy Royston, as well as a trio with Mark Helias and Barry Altschul. He is also a member of the Mary Halvorson Quintet, Septet, and Octet; the Dave Douglas Quintet; Barry Altschulâ€™s 3Dom Factor; and is a former member of Mostly Other People Do the Killing.

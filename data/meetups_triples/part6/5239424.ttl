        mtp:hasAbstract        "Fred Hopkins (October 11, 1947 â€“ January 7, 1999) was an American double bassist who played a major role in the development of the avant-garde jazz movement. He was best known for his association with the trio Air with Henry Threadgill and Steve McCall, and for his numerous performances and extensive recordings with major jazz musicians such as Muhal Richard Abrams, Arthur Blythe, Oliver Lake, and David Murray. He was a member of the AACM, and a frequent participant in the loft jazz scene of the 1970s. He also co-led a number of albums with the composer and cellist Diedre Murray. Gary Giddins wrote that Hopkins' playing \"fused audacious power with mercuric reflexes.\" Howard Reich, writing in the Chicago Tribune, stated that \"many connoisseurs considered [Hopkins] the most accomplished jazz bassist of his generation\" and praised him for \"the extraordinarily fluid technique, sumptuous tone and innovative methods he brought to his instrument.\"" ;

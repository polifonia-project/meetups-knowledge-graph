        mtp:hasAbstract        "Vladislav Balovatsky (Ukrainian: Владислав Баловацький; born 23 November 1994), known professionally as Capital Bra (German pronunciation: [kɐpiˌtal ˈbɾa]), is a German rapper. Born in a small town in Siberia, Russia and raised in Dnipro, Ukraine, he and his mother moved to Berlin, Germany in the early 2000s. He started rapping at the age of 11 and participated at Rap am Mittwoch in 2014, a German battle rap tournament. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, Capital Bra released his first studio album Kuku Bra in January 2016 to minor commercial success in Germany. The follow-ups Makarov Complex and Blyat were released in February and September 2017 and peaked in the top 5 of German-speaking Europe. His fourth studio album, Berlin lebt (2018), peaked at number one in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and the follow-up Allein (2018), debuted at number two on the German album charts. Balovatsky is the most successful charting German act, with 22 number-one songs in Germany." ;

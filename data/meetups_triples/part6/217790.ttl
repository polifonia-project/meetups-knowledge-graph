Subsequent appearances in Casper and Now and Then (both 1995) established her as a teen idol. At 17, she moved into adult-oriented roles with The Ice Storm (1997), which led to parts in several independent films, such as Pecker (1998), The Opposite of Sex (1998), and Monster (2003). She has also starred in Sleepy Hollow (1999), Penelope (2006), and Speed Racer (2008), and had a supporting role in The Matrix Resurrections (2021). On television, Ricci appeared in the final season of Ally McBeal (2002), and had a guest role on Grey's Anatomy in 2006.

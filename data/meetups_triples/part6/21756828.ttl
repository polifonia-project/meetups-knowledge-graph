        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrew Jackson \"Jack\" Rhodes (January 12, 1907 â€“ October 9, 1968) was an American country music producer and songwriter, with songwriting credits on over 625 released songs. Several of his songs became hit records, including \"A Satisfied Mind\", \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\", \"Conscience I'm Guilty\", \"The Waltz of the Angels\", \"Beautiful Lies\", and \"Till the Last Leaf Shall Fall\". Inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame posthumously in 1972, he was more recently celebrated as one of the founding fathers of rockabilly, having written for Gene Vincent and Capitol Records. He was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame in 2009. Jack Rhodes memorabilia is on exhibit at the Mineola Historical Museum in Mineola, Texas and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in Nashville. Rhodes is recognized for the groundbreaking rockabilly songs \"Rockin' Bones\", \"Action Packed\", and \"Woman Love\". Revered as an influential mentor for many an upstart artist in the mid to late 1950s, he and his collaborators wrote many songs for Gene Vincent while on the Capitol label. BMI awarded him for over a million radio broadcasts of \"Silver Threads and Golden Needles\", and he received numerous gold records for various releases. One of these was a US country music #1 hit with \"A Satisfied Mind\" by Porter Wagoner." ;

Fujioka is a cultural icon in Japan, even having the minor planet 12408 Fujioka, discovered by Akimasa Nakamura, named in his honor. Fujioka writes his name with the ideographic comma at the end (after the kanji for \"Hiroshi\" (弘)), saying \"It is meant to remind me to reconsider myself and what it is that I need to achieve. It shows that I am not yet finished with my tasks and must continue working toward their accomplishment.\" Hiroshi's son, Maito, serves as the current ambassador of Sega as of March 26, 2020, portraying as Segata Sanshiro's son Sega Shiro, as well as Takeshi Hongo's younger-self as of 2021, starting from Kamen Rider: Beyond Generations." ;

Javier signed with the Astros as an international free agent in 2015 and made his MLB debut in 2020. During the Astros' World Series championship season in 2022, Javier was the starting pitcher of two combined no-hitters—including Game 4 of the World Series—the first player in MLB history to do so. The World Series no-hitter was just the second in baseball history, and the only combined no-hitter." ;

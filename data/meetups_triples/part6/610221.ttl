        mtp:hasAbstract        "Timothy James Salmon (born August 24, 1968), nicknamed \"King Fish\", is an American former professional baseball player and current sportcaster. He played his entire career in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1992 to 2006 with the Anaheim Angels as an outfielder and designated hitter. Salmon was an integral member of the Angels team that won the 2002 World Series. He is an analyst for Bally Sports West's Angels Live pre-and-postgame shows. Salmon is considered one of the most prolific and beloved players in Angels history. At the time of his retirement, Salmon had the most home runs in Angels history with 299, since surpassed by Mike Trout in 2020. He was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame in 2015 and no Angels player has worn his No. 15 since his retirement." ;

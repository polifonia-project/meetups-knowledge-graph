His debut novel, 1999's Summer Gone, was shortlisted for the Giller Prize and was a winner of the Books in Canada First Novel Award. His Newfoundland family memoir, \"The Danger Tree,\" (published as Come From Away in the US) published in 1991, was greeted with extraordinary international acclaim. His most recent novel, \"The Figures of Beauty,\" published in 2013, won the Bressani Literary Prize. It was described by the Wall Street Journal as \"a moving tale of love, fate, and regret.\" David Macfarlane's magazine and newspaper writing has earned him a National Newspaper Award and numerous National Magazine Awards. His play, \"Fishwrap,\" premiered at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto. His musical portrait of the city in which he lives, \"The Toronto Suite,\" was performed by the Via Salzburg Ensemble at the Glenn Gould Theatre.

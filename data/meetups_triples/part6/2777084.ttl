        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexander Pantages (Περικλῆς Ἀλέξανδρος Πανταζής | Periklis Alexandros Padazis; 1867 - February 17, 1936) was a Greek American vaudeville impresario and early motion picture producer. He created a large and powerful circuit of theatres across the western United States and Canada. At the height of his empire, he owned or operated 84 theatres across the United States and Canada. In 1929, he was accused of raping a 17-year-old dancer named Eunice Alice Pringle; the negative publicity led to the selling of his operations and he ceased to be a force in exhibition or vaudeville ever again. He is largely forgotten today in historical accounts of the early development of motion pictures. He died in 1936 worth only a fraction of his previous net worth." ;

Prosecutors alleged Miller was inspired by the eponymous plot device of the film Double Indemnity, a provision in which the proceeds of a life insurance policy pay double the face value for accidental deaths. Joan Didion wrote a 1966 essay about the case, \"Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream\", which appeared originally in The Saturday Evening Post as \"How Can I Tell Them There's Nothing Left\" (a quote from Lucille Miller the morning of the fire); it was included in her 1968 book Slouching Towards Bethlehem." ;

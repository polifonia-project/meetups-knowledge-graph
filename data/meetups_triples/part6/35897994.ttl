        mtp:hasAbstract        "June Campbell Cramer (3 June 1931 â€“ 7 June 1999), better known as Lady June, was an English painter, poet and musician. She was associated with the Canterbury scene and recorded two albums. She exhibited and performed her works in several countries, often combining her painting, poetry and music into multimedia presentations. Richie Unterberger at AllMusic described her as a \"Bohemian artist\", and an obituary in The Independent called her \"a great British eccentric and cosmic prankster\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Justus Hiddes Halbertsma, West Frisian form: Joast Hiddes Halbertsma, pron. [jo.ǝst ˈhɪdəs ˈhɔlbǝtsma] (the r is silent); Dutch form: Joost Hiddes Halbertsma, pron. [joːst ˈhɪdəs ˈhalbǝrtsma] (23 October 1789 in Grou – 27 February 1869 in Deventer), was a Frisian writer, poet, minister, lexicographer and linguist. Today, he is primarily known for the poetry and short story collection De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, which he wrote with his brother Eeltsje, publishing the first edition in 1822. Afterwards, this work was continually expanded, and also came to include contributions by a third brother, Tsjalling, until all the Halbertsma Brothers' prose and poetry was posthumously collected in 1871 to become the famous work Rimen en Teltsjes. Although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics, it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries." ;

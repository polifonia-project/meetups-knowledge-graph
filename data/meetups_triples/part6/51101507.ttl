His first hit single, \"Human\", was released in 2016, and his debut album of the same name was released in 2017. The album became the fastest selling album by a male for the entire decade and has since achieved 4Ã— Platinum certification. At the 2017 Brit Awards, he was named British Breakthrough Act and received the Critics' Choice Award and went on to receive a further BRIT Award for Best British Single, with the title track in 2018. Following the album's success, Rag'n'Bone Man has performed at headline shows and festivals around the globe and has collaborated with a variety of artists from different genres, including Bugzy Malone (with the track \"Run\"), Logic (with the song \"Broken People\" for the soundtrack of Netflix film Bright) and Calvin Harris (with Brit Award nominated and Ivor Novello award-winning single \"Giant\"). In January 2021, Graham released \"All You Ever Wanted\", the lead single from his second studio album Life by Misadventure. He then collaborated with Pink for the second single from the album, \"Anywhere Away from Here\". The album was originally set to be released on 23 April 2021, but was postponed to 7 May 2021. Life By Misadventure debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and spent 7 weeks in the top 10, making it the fastest-selling album by a solo artist in 2021 and gaining Gold certification in the UK." ;

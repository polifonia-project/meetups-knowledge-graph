While Norman was resident engineer at Ridge Farm Studios in London, Ozzy Osbourne was recording his debut solo album Blizzard of Ozz with producer/engineer Chris Tsangarides. After Osbourne and Tsangarides parted ways, Norman was asked to carry on. Norman appears in the Megadeth home video Evolver, a documentary about the making of Youthanasia. In early 2017, Norman completed projects with artists Ethan Brosh at Carriage House Studios, Machinage, and Mean Streak." ;

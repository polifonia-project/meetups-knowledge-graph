        mtp:hasAbstract        "Norman Wardhaugh Walker (4 January 1886, Italy â€“ 6 June 1985, Cottonwood, Arizona) was a British businessman and pioneer in the field of vegetable juicing and nutritional health. He advocated the drinking of fresh raw vegetable and fruit juices for health. Based on his design, the Norwalk Hydraulic Press Juicer was developed. This juicer was produced until its manufacturer, Norwalk, Inc., located in Bentonville, Arkansas, ceased operations in October 2021. Walker was the author of at least 11 books on nutrition and healthy living, published from 1936 to 1981. As of 2006, many book reviews and promotional websites wrongly claim that Walker reached the age of, variously, 109, 113, 116, 118 or 119 years. Several official sources, including the US Social Security Death Index and a grave marker all indicate that he actually lived to be 99 years of age." ;

She played on the LPGA of Korea Tour winning five times between 1999 and 2003. She won once on the Futures Tour in 2001. She played on the LPGA Tour from 2003 to 2009, winning the 2007 LPGA Corning Classic. Kim's best ever finish in a major championship was a T3 at the 2005 Women's British Open. Kim was second to Lorena Ochoa for Rookie of the Year in 2003. She is perhaps best known for her different hat wear. Kim, when asked to describe the headgear she was wearing, called it a 'bucket hat'." ;

As a bandleader, he led bands such as Buddy Lucas & His Band of Tomorrow, the Gone All Stars, and Buddy Lucas & His Shouters, and he also went under the stage name of \"Big\" Buddy Lucas. As a session musician, he recorded with Horace Silver, Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie, Titus Turner The Rascals, Yusef Lateef, and Aretha Franklin, amongst others. He also played sax on Dion and the Belmonts (and Dion's later solo recordings) on Laurie Records. He was born in Rockville, Alabama, and died in Stamford, Connecticut, aged 68." ;

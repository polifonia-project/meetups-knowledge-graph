        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Evett (16 October 1874 â€“ 15 January 1949) was an English singer, actor, theatre manager and producer. He was best known as a leading man in Edwardian musical comedies and later managed the George Edwardes theatrical empire. In 1892, at age 18, Evett joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on tour in leading tenor roles. Six years later, he was starring in the company's London cast at the Savoy Theatre, where he stayed until the company left the Savoy in 1903. He soon began to appear in Edwardian musicals in the West End, first in The Earl and the Girl (1903). He continued to star in musicals and operettas for the next decade, including in The Little Michus (1905), The Merry Widow (1907), A Waltz Dream (1908) and The Girl in the Train (1910). In 1913 and 1914, he performed on Broadway. He also lent his voice to early acoustic recordings of songs. Upon the death of the famous producer George Edwardes in 1915, Evett returned to England; there he became the managing director of Daly's Theatre, the Gaiety Theatre and Edwardes' other theatres. He produced such hits as The Maid of the Mountains (1917), sometimes directing and even writing shows. His last production was in 1925." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Richard Parisi (born April 18, 1983 in Huntington, New York) was a right-handed professional baseball pitcher. Parisi had a short-lived career in professional baseball as a right-handed pitcher. His career came to ahead after he completely blew the game for the St. Louis Cardinals against the Boston Red Sox. The game was the end to his career. Parisi is the second Major League Baseball player to hail from Sachem High School in Lake Ronkonkoma, New York on Long Island. However, Mike Parisi was described as subpar several times throughout his career in multiple sources including The Bleacher Report." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "El Sagrado (born June 19, 1980) is a Mexican Luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler currently working for the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). His ring name is Spanish for \"The Sacred One\". Working as \"Sagrado\" won the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship with Misterioso, Jr. as well as having formerly held the Mexican National Trios Championship twice, with different partners as well as the Occidente Light Heavyweight Championship on one occasion. Like many children in Mexico, El Sagrado grew up idolizing Lucha libre (professional wrestling), especially El Santo. At the age of 12 he told his parents he wanted to become a professional wrestler, something his parents opposed. The young Sagrado found a way to train to become a professional wrestler without his parents knowing it, his brothers covered for him by telling his parents that he was at football practice instead. One of his younger brothers became a professional wrestler as well, using the ring name \"Metatron\". Besides wrestling Sagrado also studied religion, urged by his mother to seek the priesthood when he was old enough. According to Sagrado he met Fray Tormenta, the famous Mexican wrestling priest who told him to follow his own desires, which in turn led him to become a wrestler. Whether this is actually true or part of the storyline build up around the \"El Sagrado\" character is not known, but Sagrado has stated that he met Fray Tormenta in several interviews." ;

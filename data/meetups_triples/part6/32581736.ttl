He was born in Hugh Town on the Isles of Scilly. Bell made his debut in county cricket for Cornwall County Cricket Club in the 1990 MCCA Knockout Trophy against Wiltshire. In that same season he made his first-class debut for Gloucestershire against Glamorgan in the 1990 County Championship.

In his three first-class matches, he took 3 wickets at an average of 41.00, with best figures of 2/38. Bell also made a single List A appearance for Gloucestershire, which came in 1990 against Yorkshire in the Refuge Assurance League.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mary Rose Byrne (born 24 July 1979) is an Australian actress. She made her screen debut in the film Dallas Doll (1994), and continued to act in Australian film and television throughout the 1990s. She obtained her first leading film role in The Goddess of 1967 (2000), which brought her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress, and made the transition to Hollywood in the small role of Dormé in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002), followed by larger parts in Troy (2004), 28 Weeks Later (2007), and Knowing (2009). Byrne appeared as Ellen Parsons in the legal thriller series Damages (2007–2012), which earned her two Golden Globe Awards nominations and two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Get Him to the Greek (2010) and Bridesmaids (2011) established her as a comedic actress, in addition to the dramas and thrillers in which she continues to appear. She has since starred in a number of commercially successful comedies and dramas, including Insidious (2010) and its sequel Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013), X-Men: First Class (2011) and its sequel X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), Annie (2014), as well as Peter Rabbit (2018) and its sequel Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway (2021)." ;

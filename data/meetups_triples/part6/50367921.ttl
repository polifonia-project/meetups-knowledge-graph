        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Bilhaud (31 December 1854 – 8 January 1933) was a French playwright and librettist. An old friend of the author Alphonse Allais, he is remembered along his friend as a forerunner of minimalism with his painting Combat de nègres pendant la nuit (\"(Battle of negroes during the night\"), displayed for the first time in 1882, more than thirty years before the « Black Square » by Kazimir Malevich. Missing since 1882, this painting was found by expert Johann Naldi in 2017–2018 in a private collection. It has been classified as a National Treasure by the French state. However, Bilhaud was not the first to create an all-black artwork: for example, Robert Fludd published an image of \"Darkness\" in his 1617 book on the origin and structure of the cosmos; and Bertall published his black Vue de La Hogue (effet de nuit) in 1843.) Inspired by Bilhaud, Alphonse Allais proposed other monochrome paintings, published in his Album primo-avrilesque in 1897." ;

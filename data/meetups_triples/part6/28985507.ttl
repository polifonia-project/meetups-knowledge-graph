        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas R. Koehler (born June 29, 1986) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Koehler played college baseball at Stony Brook University for the Stony Brook Seawolves and was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 18th round of the 2008 MLB Draft. He played six seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Miami Marlins and Toronto Blue Jays. After not appearing in a major league game since 2017, Koehler retired in 2020 due to numerous injuries. Koehler ranks top ten in numerous Marlins franchise pitching statistics, including games started, innings pitched, strikeouts, earned run average (ERA) and walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP). He currently remains the last Marlins pitcher to have ever started 30 games in three consecutive seasons for the team." ;

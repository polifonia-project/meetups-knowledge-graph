        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carlos Alberto Mestre (born August 3, 1952 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) mostly known by his stage name Nito Mestre, is an Argentine musician, founding member –along with Charly García– of Sui Generis, member of PorSuiGieco, bandleader of Nito Mestre y los Desconocidos de Siempre and a recording solo artist. Sui Generis, was initially formed in 1969 by Charly García (keyboards and vocals), Nito Mestre (guitar, flute and vocals), Rolando Fortich (bass guitar), Juan Belia (guitar), Alberto Rodriguez (drums) and Carlos Piegari (vocals). Later on, Sui Generis became a duo as everyone left except for García. After the band split in 1975, Nito Mestre formed a new band called \"Nito Mestre y los Desconocidos de Siempre\" with María Rosa Yorio on vocals, Rodolfo Gorosito on guitar, on bass, on keyboards and Juan Carlos \"Mono\" Fontana as a drummer. In the early 80s, Nito pursued a solo career." ;

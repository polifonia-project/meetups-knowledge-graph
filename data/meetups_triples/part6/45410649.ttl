        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jacob James Nix (born January 9, 1996) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres. He was picked by the Houston Astros in the fifth round of the 2014 MLB draft out of Los Alamitos High School. They agreed on an above slot signing bonus, which the Astros were unable to pay when first round pick Brady Aiken refused to sign, which lowered their bonus pool. He went unsigned himself, and attended the IMG Academy, and was then drafted by the Padres in the third round of the 2015 MLB draft." ;

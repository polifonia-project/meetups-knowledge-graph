        mtp:hasAbstract        "Barry Egan (born 18 August 1972) is an Irish retired hurler who played as a right wing-forward for the Cork senior team. Born in Cork, Egan first played competitive hurling during his schooling at the North Monastery. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor teams as a dual player, before later joining the under-21 sides. He made his senior debut during the 1991-92 National Hurling League. Egan went on to play a key role for Cork, and won one Munster medal and two National Hurling League games. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Egan won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a one-time championship medallist with Delaney Rovers in the intermediate grade. Throughout his career Egan made ten championship appearances for Cork. He was dropped from the Cork panel after the conclusion of the 1998 championship." ;

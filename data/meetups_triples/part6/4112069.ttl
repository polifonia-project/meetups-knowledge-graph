        mtp:hasAbstract        "Adam James Hammill (born 25 January 1988) is an English former footballer who played as a winger. Hammill represented England U21s, though he also qualified to play for the Republic of Ireland at international level. Hammill is a product of the Liverpool academy, but failed to make a league appearance for the club at senior level, before leaving to join Championship side Barnsley in 2009. After a successful period at Barnsley, he entered the Premier League when he moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2011, with whom he remained until 2013. In 2015, Hammill returned to Barnsley on a short-term contract but remained until 2018." ;

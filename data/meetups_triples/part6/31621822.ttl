        mtp:hasAbstract        "Helga Schauerte-Maubouet (born 8 Mars, 1957, Lennestadt) is a German-French organist, writer and editor of music. Schauerte has recorded the complete organ works of Jehan Alain, Dietrich Buxtehude, and J. S. Bach (in process), portraits of Buttstett, Corrette, Reger, Boëllmann, Dubois and Langlais, comprising some thirty recordings). She works as a performing artist in Europe and throughout the USA, and is Organist of the German Lutheran Church in Paris, and teaches at the Paris Conservatory Nadia et Lili Boulanger. She is also lecturer and jury member for international organ competitions. Her career has been influenced by German and French music. In 2006 she founded a Bach-organ-academy in Pontaumur (Auvergne, France). She wrote the first book in German on Jehan Alain’s music, and has acquired some forty of this composer’s musical autographs. She has been engaged by Bärenreiter to contribute to the new edition of MGG, to write on French organ music subjects in the Handbuch Orgelmusik, and to publish scholarly-critical editions of the complete organ works of Léon Boëllmann, Théodore Dubois, Louis Vierne and Jehan Alain as well as of vocal music of Marc-Antoine Charpentier. She has also composed French Noël and German carol-settings for other instruments and organ published by Merseburger-Verlag. Schauerte made her first public appearance at the age of 10. At 13 she became organist in Lennestadt. A disciple of Viktor Lukas and Marie-Claire Alain she culminated her studies respectively in Cologne, with degrees in music, pedagogy and philosophy, and in Paris, with the Premier Prix. Jean Langlais entrusted her with the first performance of several of his works, of which Miniature II is dedicated to her. In 1987 she received the cultural prize of Olpe, Germany. Since 1990 her biography has been included in the International Who’s Who in Music, and she has been selected to figure in 2000 Outstanding Musicians of the 20th Century. She was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Cultural Minister awarded her the distinction of Chevalier in the Order of Arts and Letters." ;

He was the youngest member of SMAP, one of the best-selling boy band in Asia. After the group's disbandment on 31 December 2016, Katori has been pursuing his solo career. He left Johnny & Associates on 9 September 2017, together with two other SMAP members, Goro Inagaki and Tsuyoshi Kusanagi and entered CULEN, a Japanese talent agency. On 22 September 2017, they launched a new project, \"atarashiichizu\" (\"新しい地図\", meaning \"New Map\") as their common fan site, supported by various Japanese leading creators. Since then, Katori has been extending his activities also into artistic fields." ;

Cletus was a Roman who, during his tenure as pope, ordained a number of priests and is traditionally credited with setting up about twenty-five parishes in Rome. Although the precise dates of his pontificate are uncertain, he \"...died a martyr, perhaps about 91\". Cletus is mentioned in the Roman Canon of the mass; his feast day is April 26." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Hunter Biden (born February 4, 1970) is an American attorney who is the second son of U.S. President Joe Biden and his first wife Neilia Hunter Biden. Biden is also a hedge fund, venture capital, and private-equity fund investor who formerly worked as a lobbyist, banker, public administration official, and registered lobbyist-firm attorney. Biden was discharged from the U.S. Navy Reserve shortly after his commissioning due to a failed drug test. Biden served on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine, from 2014 until his term expired in April 2019. Since the early months of 2019, Biden and his father Joe Biden have been the subjects of unsupported claims of corrupt activities in a Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory pushed by then–U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies, concerning Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine and Joe Biden's anti-corruption efforts there. Biden was a founding board member of BHR Partners, a Chinese investment company. In 2020, he began presenting artwork as a painter. In October 2020, the New York Post published an article about a laptop computer that previously belonged to Hunter Biden. The laptop contained around 129,000 emails and other materials, but the Post provided no evidence as to the chain of custody or authenticity of the device. Other media outlets opted not to publish the story due to questions about that lack of provenance. In March 2022, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported that some of the emails found on the device were authentic. Despite extensive speculation and scrutiny of the laptop contents by multiple parties, as of September 2022 no clear evidence of criminal activity by Biden has surfaced. Since late 2018, his tax affairs have been under federal criminal investigation." ;

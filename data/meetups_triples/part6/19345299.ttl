        mtp:hasAbstract        "David M. Allen (born 26 June 1953) is an English record producer, engineer and mixer. He is mostly known for his work with new wave, synthpop and goth rock bands including the Cure, the Sisters of Mercy, the Chameleons, Depeche Mode, the Mission, the Associates, the Human League, Clan of Xymox, Gianna Nannini, Shelleyan Orphan and others. He also produced Neneh Cherry's hit album Man. He created Blank Multimedia in 1994, which operated from the home of XFM from 1995â€“1997, designed websites for Chrysalis and Rough Trade Records, and made an interactive cross-platform CD+ featuring The Plunge Club with music from Andy M. Wright. Blank also organised a 24-hour Internet art gallery, groundbreaking for the era. In 2022, for Record Store Day UK, he is releasing a vinyl album, DNA of DMA on the Themsay label. This is an historical artefact from 1980 consisting mainly of solo written and produced tracks. These tracks led to a position of programmer and engineer at Genetic Studios in early 1981. This vinyl album was made record of the week by JunoDaily." ;

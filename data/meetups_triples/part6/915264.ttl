It is said that he taught the grammarian Aristophanes of Byzantium. Two fragments from two of his plays, Agnoia (Ignorance) and Epistole (The Letter), survive, along with 462 verses from a book of anecdotes about the words and deeds of notorious Athenians, preserved in the Deipnosophistae of Athenaeus. Dioscorides wrote an epitaph for Machon that has also survived." ;

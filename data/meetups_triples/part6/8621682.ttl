A family friend of Communist Party politician Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu, she was arrested by the Communist regime following the conflict between Pătrăşcanu and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. She was indicted in his trial and spent twelve years as a political prisoner. Constante was the wife of the musicologist Harry Brauner, and the sister-in-law of the painter Victor Brauner." ;

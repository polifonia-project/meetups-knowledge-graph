        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian Keith Bosworth (born March 9, 1965), nicknamed \"The Boz,\" is an American former football linebacker and actor who played in the National Football League (NFL) for three seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. A two-time Dick Butkus Award winner during his college football career at Oklahoma, he also achieved notoriety for his outspoken comments and antics. Bosworth was selected by the Seahawks in the first round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft, but his professional career would be cut short by injury. After retiring as a player, Bosworth pursued an acting career. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2015." ;

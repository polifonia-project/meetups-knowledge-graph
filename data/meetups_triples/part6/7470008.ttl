        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark Jenkins (born 1970) is an American artist who makes sculptural street installations. Jenkins' practice of street art is to use the \"street as a stage\" where his sculptures interact with the surrounding environment including passersby who unknowingly become actors. His installations often draw the attention of the police. His work has been described as whimsical, macabre, shocking and situationist. Jenkins cites Juan Mu√±oz as his initial inspiration. In addition to creating art, he also teaches his sculpture techniques and installation practices through workshops. He currently lives in Washington, DC." ;

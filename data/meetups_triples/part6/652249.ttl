He was probably French, probably lived and worked in Paris at the Notre Dame Cathedral and was the earliest member of the Notre Dame school of polyphony and the ars antiqua style who is known by name. The name Léonin is derived from \"Leoninus,\" which is the Latin diminutive of the name Leo; therefore it is likely that Léonin's given French name was Léo." ;

In WWE, he came to prominence for his partnership with Big Cass, whom he teamed with from 2013 to 2017. Together, they won the NXT Year-End Award for Tag Team of the Year in 2015. He was later moved to the 205 Live brand, where he was a two-time Cruiserweight Champion. Since leaving WWE in January 2018, he has also embarked on a rap music career initially under the name Real1, but now goes under the same name he uses on the independent circuit." ;

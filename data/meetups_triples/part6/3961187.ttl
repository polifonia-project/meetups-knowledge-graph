McSherry wore uniform number 9 when he entered the National League, then wore number 10 from 1979 through the rest of his career. A respected arbiter, he was one of several umpires who were noticeably obese. McSherry was officially listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 328 pounds (149 kg). McSherry died from cardiac arrest which occurred behind home plate during the opening game of the 1996 Major League Baseball season in Cincinnati on April 1, 1996." ;

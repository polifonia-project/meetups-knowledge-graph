He received notoriety for firing Norm Macdonald from Saturday Night Live in early 1998, a move that is widely believed to have been motivated by Macdonald's refusal to stop making jokes at the expense of Ohlmeyer's friend, O.J. Simpson. Ohlmeyer also directed the Olympics and other live sporting events while working for ABC and ESPN. He was a professor of television communications at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California." ;

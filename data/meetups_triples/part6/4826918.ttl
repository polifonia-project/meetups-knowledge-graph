His greatest success was becoming the British Superbike Champion for 2011. He also competed in the World Superbike and World Supersport championships. Hill quit motorcycle racing at the end of 2012, instead started working as a self-employed graphic designer, but announced in late 2014 that he would be running a British Superbike team during 2015. After several months of his first season as a team manager with Be Wiser Kawasaki, Hill left in August 2015, and the team folded in September. Hill announced in October 2015 that he would be running his own team named THM – Tommy Hill Motorsport – for 2016 with Yamaha R1 machines, backed by ePayMe, with riders John Hopkins and Stuart Easton." ;

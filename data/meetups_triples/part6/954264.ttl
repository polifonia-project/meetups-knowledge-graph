        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ivar the Boneless (Old Norse: Ívarr hinn Beinlausi [ˈiːˌwɑrː ˈhinː ˈbɛinˌlɔuse]; died c. 873), also known as Ivar Ragnarsson, was a Viking leader who invaded England and Ireland. According to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, he was the son of Ragnar Loðbrok and his wife Aslaug, as his brothers Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and Ubba, however, this is not sure to be historically accurate. Ivar is probably the same person as Ímar, a Viking king of Dublin between 870-873. The origin of the nickname is not certain. \"Ívarr beinlausi\" could be translated to \"Ivar legless\", but \"beinlausi\" could also be translated as \"boneless\", since \"bone\" and \"leg\" translates to the same word, \"bein\", in Old Norse. Several of the sagas describe him as lacking legs/bones or having a skeletal condition such as osteogenesis imperfecta, while a passage in Ragnarssona þáttr (also known as the tale of Ragnar's sons) suggest it refers to male impotence." ;

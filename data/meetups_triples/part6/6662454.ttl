        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Smyth (1 January 1931 – 9 February 2013) was an Irish hurler who played as a full-forward for the Clare senior team. Smyth made his first appearance for the team during the 1948–49 National Hurling League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1967 championship. During that time he won one Oireachtas medal and one Thomond Feis medal, and was a Munster final runner-up on two occasions. At club level Smyth was a five-time county club championship medallist with Ruan. After retirement from play Smyth, in 1984 he was named on a special Hurling Team of the Century made up of players never to have won an All-Ireland medal. In 2000 he was named on the Munster Hurling Team of the Millennium." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Taufiq Ismail (born 25 June 1935) is an Indonesian poet, activist and the editor of the monthly literary magazine Horison. Ismail figured prominently in Indonesian literature of the post-Sukarno period and is considered one of the pioneers of the \"Generation of '66\". He completed his education at the University of Indonesia. Before becoming active as a writer, he taught at the Institut Pertanian Bogor. In 1963, he signed the \"Cultural Manifesto\" as a document that opposed linking art to politics. This cost him his teaching position at the Institut. Ismail wrote many poems, of which the best-known are: Malu (Aku) Jadi Orang Indonesia, Tirani dan Benteng, Tirani, Benteng, Buku Tamu Musim Perjuangan, Sajak Ladang Jagung, Kenalkan, Saya Hewan, Puisi-puisi Langit, Prahara Budaya : Kilas Balik Ofensif Lekra, Ketika Kata Ketika Warna and Seulawah-Antologi Sastra Aceh. Bored with his serious writing style, in 1970 he began writing poems mixed with humor. He has won many awards, including the \"Cultural Visit Award\" from the Australian government (1977) and the S.E.A. Write Award (1994)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Princess Friederike Amalia Wilhelmine Viktoria of Prussia (12 April 1866 – 13 November 1929) was the second daughter of Frederick III, German Emperor and his wife Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of Queen Victoria. Born a member of the Prussian royal house of Hohenzollern, she became Princess Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe following her first marriage in 1890. Raised by her mother in a close, liberal, and anglophile environment, Viktoria fell in love with Alexander of Battenberg, the Prince of Bulgaria, but there was great opposition to the match and the couple never married. Following the end of her courtship with Alexander, Viktoria suffered from disordered eating and was unlucky in her search for a suitable husband. She eventually married Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe. Adolf died during the First World War, two years before the German Empire came to an end. In 1927, she caused a royal scandal by marrying a university student 35 years her junior. She died at the age of 63 in Bonn." ;

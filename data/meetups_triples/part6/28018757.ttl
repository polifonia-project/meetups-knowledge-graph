        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julie Ann Brown (born February 4, 1955) is an American retired distance runner. She won the IAAF World Cross Country Championship in 1975 and represented the United States in the 1984 Summer Olympics in the women's marathon, placing 36th. Brown set the American women's marathon record at the Nike OTC Marathon in 1978, running 2:36:23. Brown concentrated on track and cross-country running prior to the Olympic trials but a victory in the Avon Women's Marathon in 1983 convinced her that she could qualify for the Olympic marathon team. She ran a conservative race staying in the pack until the midway point and broke away finishing second, 37 seconds behind the Olympic trials winner, Joan Benoit Samuelson. She broke the 10,000 metres world record setting a time of 35:00.4 minutes in 1975. After her track career, Brown received her J.D. from Western State University and, joined a law firm as an attorney." ;

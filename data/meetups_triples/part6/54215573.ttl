        mtp:hasAbstract        "Delbert Bryant West Jr. (July 5, 1938 â€“ May 24, 2017), known professionally as Sonny West, was a friend and bodyguard of the singer Elvis Presley along with his cousin Red West for sixteen years, as part of the Elvis entourage at the Elvis Memphis home Graceland, which became known as \"The Memphis Mafia\". His parents came from Pontotoc, Mississippi, not far from Tupelo, Elvis Presley's hometown. West was one of two sons and five daughters. Both West and Elvis grew up in different lower income projects in Memphis, Tennessee and, although living near to one another, never actually met in childhood. Before and after Elvis' passing, West wrote several books, and made public appearances at Elvis related conventions and gatherings, speaking out about his time working for Presley and their relationship." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Edward \"Stump\" Weidman (February 17, 1861 – March 2, 1905) was an American professional baseball player from 1880 to 1893. He played nine years in Major League Baseball, principally as a pitcher and outfielder, for five different major league clubs. He appeared in 379 major league games, 279 as a pitcher and 122 as an outfielder, and his longest stretches were with the Detroit Wolverines (288 games, 1881–1885, 1887) and the Kansas City Cowboys (51 games, 1886). As a pitcher, Weidman compiled a 101–156 (.393) win–loss record with a 3.61 earned run average (ERA) in 2,318+1⁄3 innings pitched. He led the National League in 1881 with a 1.80 ERA and totaled 45 wins in the 1882 and 1883 seasons. He pitched more innings for the Wolverines (1,654) than any other pitcher in the club's history." ;

Sands also appeared in a number of dramatic television series in the 1960s and 1970s such as I Spy, as Davala Unawa in the 1967 The Fugitive episode \"Dossier on a Diplomat\", Dr. Harrison in the Outer Limits episode \"The Mice\", and Julia. Sands also starred in the 1963 film An Affair of the Skin as the narrator and photographer, Janice. For her work, Sands was twice nominated for a Tony Award and twice nominated for an Emmy Award." ;

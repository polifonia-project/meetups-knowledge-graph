        mtp:hasAbstract        "Anna Luisa Ewers (German: [ˈeːvɐs]; born 14 March 1993) is a German fashion model. She is featured on the 2015 Pirelli Calendar. With her multiple campaigns, covers, and runway shows she is ranked as one of the top models in the fashion industry. In 2015, Models.com reported that she was chosen as Model of the Year by the fashion industry. In a new generation of models known for their social media followings helping them get jobs, Anna Ewers has been compared to Kate Moss (with whom she co-starred in a David Yurman ad campaign) in that she is successful while keeping her private life off social media. She has also been compared to French icon Brigitte Bardot and fellow German supermodel Claudia Schiffer." ;

In 1914 he was the subject of the second successful recall attempt in California history, in which he was replaced by . Grant's recall was sparked by his cosponsorship of the Red Light Abatement Act, legislation purportedly aimed at curbing prostitution, a stance at odds with constituents in a San Francisco red-light district he represented. Wolfe, who had previously run against Grant in 1912 and lost by just 95 votes, was elected with 53 percent voting for recall. Grant lost by a margin of three-to-one in San Francisco's vice and financial districts." ;

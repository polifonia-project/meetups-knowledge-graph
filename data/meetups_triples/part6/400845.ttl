        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Anthony Parker White (August 21, 1911 – April 29, 1968), better known by his pen name Anthony Boucher (/ˈbaʊtʃər/), was an American author, critic, and editor who wrote several classic mystery novels, short stories, science fiction, and radio dramas. Between 1942 and 1947, he acted as reviewer of mostly mystery fiction for the San Francisco Chronicle. In addition to \"Anthony Boucher\", White also employed the pseudonym \"H. H. Holmes\", which was the pseudonym of a late-19th-century American serial killer; Boucher would also write light verse and sign it \"Herman W. Mudgett\" (the murderer's real name). In a 1981 poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, his novel Nine Times Nine was voted as the ninth best locked room mystery of all time." ;

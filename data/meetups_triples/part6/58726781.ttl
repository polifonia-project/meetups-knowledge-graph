        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cora Mae Bryant (May 1, 1926 â€“ October 30, 2008) was an American blues musician. She was the daughter of another American blues musician, Curley Weaver. Bryant released two solo albums in her lifetime on the Music Maker label. Part of her home in Oxford, Georgia, was thought of as a 'blues museum'. Her own music largely derived from the influence of attending impromptu performances and house parties, including her father, plus Blind Willie McTell, Buddy Moss, and other local blues musicians of the early 1930s." ;

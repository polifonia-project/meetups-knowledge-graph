        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maria Helen Bella Avenila Santamaria (September 17, 1949 â€“ December 10, 2008), better known as Didith Reyes, was a Filipina actress and singer best known for recording a string of hit love ballads in the mid-1970s like \"Araw-araw, Gabi-gabi\", \"Bakit Ako Mahihiya...?\" and \"Hindi Kami Damong Ligaw\". Many music enthusiasts regard her as one of the Philippines' \"Jukebox Queens\", along with other singers popular during her time such as Claire dela Fuente, Amapola (Maria Cabase), Eva Eugenio, Leah Navarro, and Imelda Papin. She was notorious for accidentally exposing her breasts while singing \"Bakit Ako Mahihiya?\" during the 1977 FAMAS Awards Night. Reyes was last seen being interviewed two months before her death with journalist Korina Sanchez about her retirement in the music industry and her new life as a beauty salon owner." ;

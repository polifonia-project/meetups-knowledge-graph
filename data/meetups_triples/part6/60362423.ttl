She released her debut album, English Rose, on 21 March 2019. The album is produced by Jim Abbiss, who has also produced material for artists including Adele and the Arctic Monkeys. Growing up, Constance listened to bands like The Smiths, The Stone Roses, Arctic Monkeys and Blur.Constance trained as a dancer and was accepted to the Urdang Academy. After leaving the school in 2014, she worked with producer Kwesi Darko, with whom she released her debut EP, 'In The Grass' in 2015. Constance's debut album English Rose was released on 22 March 2019. Reviewing, Pitchfork noted that \"Constance’s voice takes on scratchy, sonorous depth that brings to mind the subterranean soul of fellow London artists Nilüfer Yanya and King Krule.\" Clash noted that her songs have been described as 'indie-soul'. The BBC described her as a \"rising UK pop star\". In May 2019, she performed at The Great Escape Festival in Brighton." ;

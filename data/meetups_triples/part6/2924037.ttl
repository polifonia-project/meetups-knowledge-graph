        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lady Caroline Blackwood (16 July 1931 â€“ 14 February 1996) was an English writer, and the eldest child of the 4th Marquess of Dufferin and Ava and the brewery heiress Maureen Guinness. Active in the literary world through her journalism and her novels, Lady Caroline Blackwood made three high-profile marriages, first to the artist Lucian Freud, then to the composer Israel Citkowitz and finally to the poet Robert Lowell, who described her as \"a mermaid who dines upon the bones of her winded lovers\". Her novels are praised for their wit and intelligence, and one in particular is scathingly autobiographical in describing her unhappy childhood." ;

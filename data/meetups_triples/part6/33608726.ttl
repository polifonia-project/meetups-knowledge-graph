        mtp:hasAbstract        "Arjun Kapoor (born 26 June 1985) is an Indian actor working in Hindi films. Born to the Surinder Kapoor family, he is the son of film producer Boney Kapoor and Mona Shourie. Kapoor made his acting debut in 2012 with romance Ishaqzaade which was commercially successful and earned him several awards including Zee Cine Awards and Stardust Award for Superstar of Tomorrow â€“ Male. He then rose to more box office pull in 2014 with the successful films Gunday and 2 States. Since then, all of his subsequent films flopped at the box office except the romantic film with Kareena Kapoor Ki & Ka (2016), leading to a long setback in his career." ;

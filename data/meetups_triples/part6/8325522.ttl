        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zoe Strauss (born 1970) is an American photographer and a nominee member of Magnum Photos. She uses Philadelphia as a primary setting and subject for her work. Curator Peter Barberie identifies her as a street photographer, like Walker Evans or Robert Frank, and has said \"the woman and man on the street, yearning to be heard, are the basis of her art.\" In 2006 her work was included in the Whitney Biennial and her solo exhibition, Ramp Project: Zoe Strauss, was shown at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia. In 2012 a mid-career retrospective, Zoe Strauss: 10 Years, was shown at Philadelphia Museum of Art, accompanied in Philadelphia by a display of 54 billboards showing her photographs, and at the International Center of Photography in New York City. Strauss received a Seedling Award from the Leeway Foundation in 2002, a Pew Fellowship in 2005, a USA Gund Fellowship and a grant of $50,000 by United States Artists in 2007, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2017." ;

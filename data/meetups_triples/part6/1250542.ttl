        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jacob Edward Peavy (born May 31, 1981) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, and San Francisco Giants. He batted and threw right-handed. While with the Padres, he won the 2007 NL Cy Young Award after recording the Pitching Triple Crown that year. He was traded from the White Sox to the Red Sox in 2013 and helped them to a World Series title later that season. A year later, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, where he helped them win a World Series title later in the season. He is the second starting pitcher after Don Gullett to win two consecutive World Series championship titles with different teams, one in each league. He is one of nine players in Major League history to have won back-to-back World Series championships titles on different teams (Joc Pederson, Ben Zobrist, Jack Morris, Bill Skowron, Clem Labine, Don Gullett, Allie Clark and Ryan Theriot). Peavy wore the number 44 for most of his career. When he was traded to the San Francisco Giants, he took number 43, as 44 was retired in honor of Willie McCovey. After struggling in the middle of the 2014 season, he changed to 22." ;

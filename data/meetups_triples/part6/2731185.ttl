He is particularly recognized in connection with the founding in 1967 of Third World Press, considered the oldest independent black publishing house in the U.S. Madhubuti is a much sought-after poet and lecturer, and has convened workshops and served as guest/keynote speaker at thousands of colleges, universities, libraries and community centers in the U.S. and abroad. The name Haki means \"just\" or \"justice,\" and Madhubuti means \"precise, accurate and dependable,\" both names deriving from the Swahili language. He changed his name in 1974." ;

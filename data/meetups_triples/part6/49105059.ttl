Billie Maxwell played guitar with The White Mountain Orchestra and recorded six sides solo for the Victor Talking Machine Company in July, 1929 following the recordings made by the White Mountain Orchestra, which made her PART of the first recorded country music act in Arizona, and ARIZONA'S first recorded female country singer." ;

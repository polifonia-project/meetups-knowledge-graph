        mtp:hasAbstract        "Darren Stanley Hayes (born 8 May 1972) is an Australian singer and songwriter. He was the frontman and singer of the pop duo Savage Garden until their disbandment. Their 1997 album Savage Garden peaked at number 1 in Australia, number 2 in the United Kingdom and number 3 in the United States. It spawned the singles \"I Want You\", \"To the Moon and Back\", and Australian and US number 1 \"Truly Madly Deeply\". The duo followed the success of their debut album with Affirmation (1999), which provided additional hits such as US number 1 \"I Knew I Loved You\", and Australian number 3 \"The Animal Song\". Savage Garden parted ways in 2001. Hayes released his first solo album Spin in 2002. The album sold two million copies worldwide, debuted at Number 2 in the UK and number 3 in Australia. It delivered the hit single \"Insatiable\". Hayes's second album, The Tension and the Spark, was released in 2004. He parted way with his record label Columbia Records in 2006 and started his own independent record label, Powdered Sugar, from which he would release his third and fourth solo albums, 2007's This Delicate Thing We've Made and 2011's Secret Codes and Battleships. After a decade-long hiatus, Hayes returned in 2022 with singles \"Let's Try Being in Love\", \"Do You Remember?\", \"Poison Blood\" and \"All You Pretty Things\", all taken from his fifth studio album, Homosexual, which was released in October 2022. Hayes headlined the 2022 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade, and announced an Australian, UK and USA tour for 2023." ;

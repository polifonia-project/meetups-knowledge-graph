        mtp:hasAbstract        "Wolfgang Krull (26 August 1899 – 12 April 1971) was a German mathematician who made fundamental contributions to commutative algebra, introducing concepts that are now central to the subject. Krull was born and went to school in Baden-Baden. He attended the Universities of Freiburg, Rostock and finally Göttingen from 1919–1921, where he earned his doctorate under Alfred Loewy. He worked as an instructor and professor at Freiburg, then spent a decade at the University of Erlangen. In 1939 Krull moved to become chair at the University of Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his life. Wolfgang Krull was a member of the NSDAP. His 35 doctoral students include Wilfried Brauer, Karl-Otto Stöhr and Jürgen Neukirch." ;

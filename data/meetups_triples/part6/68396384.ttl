        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bobby Ray (born Wilhelm Robert McBain Fuehrer, October 6, 1899 â€“ March 26, 1957) was an American film comedian of the silent era. He appeared in more than sixty short films between 1914 and 1927, including a group from the mid-1920s featuring Oliver Hardy. He was originally a child actor. In addition he directed six short films and two feature films Riley of the Rainbow Division and Dugan of the Dugouts (both 1928). Following the arrival of sound, Ray developed a new career as an assistant director that continued into the 1950s. Much of his work during this period was for the low-budget studio Monogram Pictures, but he later moved into television." ;

Clifford Allen of Tiny Mixtapes' wrote \"Tim Dahl [...] approaches his well-worn axe with a battery of pedals and loops, combining determinate speed with murkier sonics to create a landscape not unlike a harsh, speed-freak variant on Hugh Hopper.\" Dahl currently lives in Brooklyn and is an active member in the music scene. He is the co-host of the Lydian Spin podcast with Lydia Lunch." ;

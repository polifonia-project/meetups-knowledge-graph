        mtp:hasAbstract        "Glenn Alan Medeiros (born June 24, 1970) is an American former musician, singer and songwriter who achieved chart success in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He is best known on the national and international music scene for his 1987 global smash, \"Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You\", and \"She Ain't Worth It\", a US chart-topper in 1990. He has remained regularly involved in the music industry in his home state of Hawaii (including several headliner and related musical variety shows in Waikiki) long after achieving global success decades ago. After his musical career peaked, Medeiros taught and was vice-principal at the Maryknoll School, a parochial school in Honolulu, Hawaii, and as a professor at Chaminade University, a private Marianist university which shares its grounds with Saint Louis School. On July 1, 2015, Medeiros became the Head of School/Principal of Saint Louis School in Honolulu, and in 2017 its president/CEO." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Madhuri Dixit Nene (n√©e Dixit; born 15 May 1967) is an Indian actress who primarily works in Hindi films. A leading actress of Indian cinema, she has appeared in over 70 films. Noted by critics for her beauty, dancing skills, and characters, Dixit was credited for singularly paralleling her male contemporaries and leading star vehicles in a male-dominated industry. She was among the country's highest-paid celebrities throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since its inception in 2012. Her accolades include six Filmfare Awards from a record 17 nominations. In 2008, the Government of India awarded her with Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian honour of the country. Born and raised in Mumbai, Dixit made her acting debut in 1984 with a leading role in the drama Abodh. After a few successive commercially failed films, she rose to prominence with the action drama Tezaab (1988), and established herself with starring roles in the top-grossing romantic dramas Dil (1990), Beta (1992), Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), and Dil To Pagal Hai (1997). She won four Filmfare Awards for Best Actress for her performances in them. Her other commercially successful films during this period include Ram Lakhan (1989), Tridev (1989), Thanedaar (1990), Kishen Kanhaiya (1990), Saajan (1991), Khalnayak (1993), and Raja (1995). Apart from Dixit's mainstream success, she earned appreciation from critics for her performances in Prem Pratigyaa (1989), Parinda (1989), Anjaam (1994), Mrityudand (1997), Pukar (2000), Lajja (2001), and Devdas (2002). She received the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for the lattermost. Following a sabbatical from acting in 2002, Dixit made a brief comeback by starring in the musical Aaja Nachle (2007), and worked intermittently over the next decades. Her highest-grossing release came with the adventure comedy Total Dhamaal (2019), and she continued to gain praise for starring in the black comedy Dedh Ishqiya (2014) and the Netflix web series The Fame Game (2022). In addition to acting in films, she has been engaged in philanthropic activities. She has worked with UNICEF since 2014 to advocate the rights of children and prevent child labour, participates in concert tours and stage shows, and is the co-founder of the production company RnM Moving Pictures. Her television work includes featuring frequently as a talent judge for dance reality shows. Since 1999, she has been married to Shriram Nene, with whom she has two sons." ;

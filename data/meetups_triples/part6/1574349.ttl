        mtp:hasAbstract        "Denny M. Bautista Germán (born August 23, 1980) is a Dominican former professional baseball pitcher. Bautista is 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) tall and weighs 190 pounds (86 kg). He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Royals, Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and San Francisco Giants from 2004 to 2010. From 2011 through 2013, he played for the Hanwha Eagles of the KBO League. He bats and throws right-handed. Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. He has struggled with control throughout his career. Bautista grew up receiving instruction on pitching from his second cousin, Pedro Martínez. The Florida Marlins signed him in 2000 but traded him to the Baltimore Orioles before Bautista reached the major leagues. He debuted with the Orioles in 2004, appearing in two games before getting traded to the Kansas City Royals. Bautista was ranked Kansas City's number two prospect by Baseball America entering the 2005 season, but he made just seven starts before missing the rest of the season with an injury. He posted a 5.66 earned run average (ERA) for the Royals in 2006 before getting traded to the Colorado Rockies. He appeared in nine games (all in relief) for the Rockies in 2007, spending most of the year in the minor leagues. After 2007, Bautista never made another start in the major leagues. He began 2008 with the Detroit Tigers bullpen but had an injury and was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates during the year. He re-signed with Pittsburgh in 2009 but only appeared in 14 games, spending most of the year in the minors. Bautista posted a 3.74 ERA with the San Francisco Giants in 2010 but was never on their playoff roster and was released during the playoffs. In 2011, he signed with the Seattle Mariners but was assigned to the minor leagues. Halfway through the season, he joined the Hanwha Eagles of the Korea Baseball Organization. On April 18, 2015, it was announced that he had signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jimmy Powell (January 17, 1935 â€“ January 16, 2021) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1960s and 1970s, but whose greatest success came on the Senior PGA Tour in the early to mid-1990s. Powell was born in Dallas, Texas. He graduated from Dallas' Sunset High School and attended North Texas State University. He turned pro in 1959. He was the golf pro at Stevens Park Golf Course in Dallas during the 1980s. Powell had limited success during the regular phase of his career, but won several official and unofficial events as a senior. In 1995, Powell became the first player to ever win both the Super Seniors competition and the Senior PGA Tour event at the same tournament. He accomplished this at the 1995 First of America Classic. He holds or shares several other Champions Tour records. Powell lived much of his adult life in La Quinta, California. He was involved in a golf course design business with Harold Heers; the courses they have designed are mainly in the western United States." ;

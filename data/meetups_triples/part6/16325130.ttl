        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Jacques Lanois (April 4, 1948 â€“ April 19, 2021) was a Canadian sound engineer, record producer, and harmonica player. He released his first album (in which he played harmonica) in 2006, Snake Road, with his brother Daniel Lanois. He also recorded an album with guitarist Tom Wilson, entitled The Shack Recordings Volume One. Among other credits, he co-produced Simply Saucer's demo tape with Daniel. He was also given a credit in the \"Thanks to\" section of U2's The Joshua Tree album credits. Bob Lanois travelled to Sweden in 2007, performing shows together with eclectic Swedish band Big Is Less after having met the band's guitarist Tommy Sahlin via MySpace. In 2008, Lanois, as producer, teamed up with Mass Conception (a Canadian indie band) which resulted in the release of a six-song EP entitled No Pun Intended. He died on April 19, 2021." ;

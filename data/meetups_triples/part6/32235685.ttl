Zeena was raised within the Church of Satan, and came to international prominence early in life as the organization's spokesperson, defending the Church during the 1980s. She resigned her position in 1990, severed ties with her father, and renounced LaVeyan Satanism. Her religious path eventually led to teaching Tibetan Tantric Buddhism." ;

Her musical influences are pop music and the American tradition of the singer-songwriter in which the lyrics play an important role as well as the music. She lives in Oslo but has throughout her career had the whole of Norway as a venue. When she made her breakthrough in 1996 with her debut album (Polygram), she became an important mediator of the singer-songwriter genre, a genre that has a broad audience in Norwegian popular music." ;

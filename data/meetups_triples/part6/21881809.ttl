        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kylie Kristen Jenner (born August 10, 1997) is an American media personality, socialite, and businesswoman. She starred in the E! reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians from 2007 to 2021 and is the founder and owner of cosmetic company Kylie Cosmetics. She is the third-most-followed person on Instagram. At age 14 in 2012, Jenner collaborated with the clothing brand PacSun, along with her sister Kendall, and created a line of clothing, Kendall & Kylie. In 2015, she launched her own cosmetics line called Kylie Lip Kits, which was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics the following year. They also released a mobile app that reached number one on the iTunes App Store called Kendall and Kylie. In 2014 and 2015, Time magazine listed the Jenner sisters on their list of the most influential teens in the world, citing their considerable influence among youth on social media. In 2017, Jenner was placed on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, making her the youngest person to be featured on the list. Jenner starred on her own spin-off series, Life of Kylie, which premiered in 2017. In November 2018, New York Post credited her for being the most influential celebrity in the fashion industry. In 2019, Forbes estimated Jenner's net worth at US$1 billion and called her the world's youngest self-made billionaire at age 21; the notion of Jenner being self-made has been controversial. In May 2020, Forbes released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire." ;

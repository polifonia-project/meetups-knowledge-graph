        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Daniel \"Dick\" Bass (December 21, 1929 â€“ July 26, 2015) was an American businessman, rancher and mountaineer. He was the owner of Snowbird Ski Resort in Utah and the first man to climb the \"Seven Summits\", the tallest mountain on each continent. In 1985, he became the oldest person to reach the summit of Mount Everest, aged 55. He climbed with David Breashears and Nepalese sherpa Ang Phurba, surpassing the record by five years set in April of that year by Englishman Chris Bonington. Bass's record stood until 1993 when it was broken by 60-year-old Ramon Blanco." ;

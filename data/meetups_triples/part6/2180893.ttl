        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Michael Curtin (born 30 January 1983) is an English former professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE as a writer on Raw. During his time as an on screen performer in the company, he worked under the ring name Drake Maverick. He has also worked for Impact Wrestling (formerly Total Nonstop Action Wresting), under the ring name Rockstar Spud. During his first decade, Curtin worked in the British independent circuit, winning several championships in promotions like International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK), One Pro Wrestling (1PW), Revolution Pro Wrestling (RPW), and XWA Wrestling. In 2012, he appeared in the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, later Impact Wrestling) program British Boot Camp, winning the competition and being signed to a contract with the promotion. In TNA/Impact, he was a two-time X Division Champion. Curtin left Impact in October 2017 and signed a contract with WWE that same month. He would be named as the on-screen General Manager of 205 Live, the brand created by WWE for their cruiserweight division (205 lbs. and under), and served for a brief time as the manager of AOP on Raw. In 2019, he became more active as an in-ring competitor, becoming an eight-time 24/7 Champion. He was released from the company in April 2020 due to budget cuts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Following his release, WWE still had Curtin compete in the multi-month Interim NXT Cruiserweight Championship tournament. After losing the finals, he was given a new WWE contract and joined the NXT brand." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jesse Hall \"Pete\" Allen (May 1, 1868 â€“ April 16, 1946) was a professional baseball player whose career spanned two seasons, including a part of one in Major League Baseball with the Cleveland Spiders (1893). Allen played one game in the majors and went hitless four at-bats. In that game, Allen played catcher. He also played in the minor leagues with the Binghamton Bingoes (1893) and the New Castle, Pennsylvania baseball team (1895). During Allen's time in the minors, he played catcher and outfielder. After his baseball career was over, Allen enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he graduated in 1897. Soon after, Allen began practicing medicine, specializing in proctology." ;

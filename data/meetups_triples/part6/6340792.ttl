        mtp:hasAbstract        "Raymond Barry Bankote Jones (28 August 1988 â€“ 25 August 2007) was an English professional footballer who played as a striker. Jones spent his professional career at Queens Park Rangers, making his debut in the Football League Championship in April 2006. His good form at the start of the following season led to his only international match, for England under-19 against the Netherlands, as well as bids for other clubs to sign him. He totalled six goals in 37 professional matches. Jones died three days before his 19th birthday, when he drove head-on into a bus in London. His club retired his shirt number of 31. An inquest into the accident ruled that had Jones survived, he would have faced charges of causing death by dangerous driving for the deaths of his two passengers." ;

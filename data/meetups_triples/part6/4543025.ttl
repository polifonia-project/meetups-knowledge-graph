        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Rhys Bellamy is the multi-instrumentalist responsible for contributing guitar, bass, synthesizer, keyboard, trumpet, programming, samples, melodica, harmonica, percussion, toy piano, bowed guitar, decks, FX/beats, vocals and lyrics in the band The Cooper Temple Clause. He is also a keen DJ and has remixed several songs by The Cooper Temple Clause as part of his side project, Rhysmix. Following the split of the band, Bellamy has turned his full attention to remixing and djing under the Rhysmix alias. He is currently collaborating with well-known DJ Eddy Temple-Morris under the name Losers, remixing and producing music in the Bleak House, a studio in rural Berkshire that formerly housed The Cooper Temple Clause. Originally the lead guitarist of the band, Bellamy began to experiment with guitar pedals, synthesisers and a variety of other instruments, passing the role of lead guitarist to bandmate Dan Fisher. He wrote the lyrics to \"Talking to a Brick Wall\", \"Into My Arms\" and \"In Your Prime\" for their 2003 album Kick Up The Fire, And Let The Flames Break Loose. Prior to the release of 2007's Make This Your Own, songs featuring Bellamy on lead vocals tended to be b-sides; however the band's third album saw an increase in the number of tracks he contributed lead vocals to." ;

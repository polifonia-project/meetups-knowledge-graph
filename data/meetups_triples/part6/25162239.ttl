        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter Grubb Jr. (1740â€“1786), Patriot and second son of Peter and Martha Bates Grubb, was a second-generation member of the Grubb Family Iron Dynasty along with his older brother Curtis Grubb. They operated the Cornwall Ironworks, making significant contributions to the American Revolutionary War effort. The brothers inherited the ironworks from their father in 1754, with Peter, as the youngest, receiving only a one-third interest. They took over operation of the ironworks about 1765 and expanded it successfully. Peter, who had more ironmaking experience, took over the nearby Hopewell Forges, making bar iron from pig iron produced by Curtis at Cornwall Furnace. They operated the business through and after the Revolution, becoming quite prosperous until they died, Peter in 1786 and Curtis in 1789. Most of the Cornwall Ironworks fell out of family hands during the period 1783 - 1802, to Robert Coleman who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire. But a portion remained with Peter Jr.'s heirs, who added to it to become major Pennsylvania producers of iron in the mid-19th century, operating out of Mount Hope Estate." ;

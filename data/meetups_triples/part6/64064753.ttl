Through his creation of the samba no prato (samba on the cymbals) and his early recordings, he helped shape Brazilian samba and bossa nova. Throughout his life, he collaborated frequently with a variety of musicians including Chet Baker and Ron Carter and was recorded in over 50 albums until his sudden death in 1990. Despite the impact he made as one of the founders of bossa nova his name has been largely forgotten." ;

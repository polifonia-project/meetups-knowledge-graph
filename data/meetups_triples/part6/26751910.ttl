He played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines and the Baylor Bears. In the 2010 NBA draft, he was selected by the Golden State Warriors with the sixth overall pick. With a 7'4 1⁄2\" wingspan, Udoh was the Big 12 Conference's leading shot blocker during the 2009–10 season. He led the conference in his only season at Baylor (2009–10), after transferring from Michigan where, as a sophomore for the 2007–08 Michigan Wolverines, he led the Big Ten Conference in blocked shots with 2.9 per game (92 blocks total) in 2007–08. A two−time All-EuroLeague Team selection, Udoh led Fenerbahçe to a EuroLeague title in 2017, earning the EuroLeague Final Four MVP award in the process. Udoh was selected for the Nigerian national team for both the 2019 FIBA World Cup and the 2020 Olympic Games." ;

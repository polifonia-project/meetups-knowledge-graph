He made a total of ten runs in the match in a \"crushing defeat\" for the county. He played for Somerset Second XI in 1939 before returning to play for Dorset after the Second World War. Freeman's father, Edward, his grandfather, also called Edward, and his great-uncle Thomas Russell, all played first-class cricket and his brother, another Edward, also played for Dorset. His uncle was Tich Freeman who played for Kent between 1914 and 1936 and is the county's leading wicket-taker.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Ivan Simon (né Simmon; May 12, 1925 − November 24, 2019) was an American author and literary, theater, and film critic. After spending his early years in Belgrade, he moved to the United States, serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and studying at Harvard University. Beginning in the 1950s, he wrote arts criticism for a variety of publications, including a 36-year tenure as theatre critic for New York magazine, and latterly as a blogger. His reviews were known for their sardonic comments and negative disposition; his obituary in The New York Times called him a \"caustic\" critic who \"saw little that he liked\", and The Washington Post reported that a published collection of 245 film reviews he wrote contained only 15 positive ones. His controversial writing style, which could include harsh remarks about the physical appearances of performers, at times led to accusations of bigotry, public rebukes from fellow critics, and confrontations with the artists he wrote about." ;

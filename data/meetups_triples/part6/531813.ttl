He is famous for his style of poetry which he popularized, called she'r-e now (شعر نو, lit. \"new poetry\"), also known as She'r-e Nimaa'i (شعر نیمایی, lit \"Nima poetry\") in his honour after his death. He is considered as the father of modern Persian poetry. He died of pneumonia in Shemiran, in the northern part of Tehran and was buried in his native village of Yush, Nur County, Mazandaran, as he had willed." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maggie Taylor (born 1961 in Cleveland, Ohio) is an artist who works with digital images. She won the Santa Fe Center for Photography's Project Competition in 2004. Her work has been widely exhibited in the United States and Europe and is represented within the permanent collections of several galleries and museums. Her work has evolved from black and white urban landscapes to personal and colorful narrative images. The early beginnings of her process consisted of setting up found objects and photographs to create collages that she would photograph in film. This was expensive and required extra consideration as one mistake could ruin the resulting images. She produces prints by taking digital photographs and scanning objects into a computer using a flatbed scanner, then layering and manipulating these images using Adobe Photoshop into a surrealistic montage. The flexibility of Photoshop technology allowed her to bypass these issues and shift her process to creating different layers that come together in a single image. The creative director of Adobe first asked Maggie Taylor's husband at the time, Jerry Uelsmann, to try using the program Photoshop. Uelsmann didn't like the program, but Taylor was intrigued by its abilities and started to experiment with it more. At first it was just a hobby to play around with photographs, but soon she was using it to create all her artwork. In 1996 and 2001 she received State of Florida Individual Artist's Fellowships." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alyson Shotz (born 1964) is an American sculptor based in Brooklyn, New York. She is best known for experiential, large-scale abstract sculptures and installations inspired by nature and scientific concepts, which manipulate light, shadow, space and gravity in order to investigate and complicate perception. Writers suggest her work challenges tenets of monumental, minimalist sculpture—traditionally welded, solid, heavy and static—through its accumulation of common materials in constructions that are often flexible, translucent, reflective, seemingly weightless, and responsive to changing conditions and basic forces. Sculpture critic Lilly Wei wrote, \"In Shotz’s realizations, the definition of sculpture becomes increasingly expansive—each project, often in series, testing another proposition, another possibility, another permutation, while ignoring conventional boundaries.\" Shotz’s artwork has been loosely grouped into three types: expansive, generally large-scale sculptures and installations that are intricate and handmade; more minimal, self-contained sculptures that sometimes involve fabrication and elements of chance; and abstract photographs and digital prints based on photographs. It belongs to the public collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, among others. She has exhibited at venues including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), Guggenheim Bilbao, Wexner Center for the Arts, and Indianapolis Museum of Art." ;

He took 3 wickets during the tournament at an average of 5.66 and with best figures of 2/7. He later played for the United States Virgin Islands in their second appearance in the Stanford 20/20 in 2008, making two appearances in a preliminary round victory against and in a first-round defeat against Antigua and Barbuda.

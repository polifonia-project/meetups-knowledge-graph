        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christopher Taylor (born 1967) is an American attorney and politician who has served as the mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan since 2014. He has earned four degrees from the University of Michigan, and served on the boards of directors of various Ann Arbor non-profit organizations before being elected to public office. In 2008, Taylor was elected to Ann Arbor City Council as a Democrat, on which he served a total of three terms before announcing his mayoral campaign in 2013. After winning a highly contested Democratic primary in August 2014, he was elected Mayor of Ann Arbor on November 4, 2014, winning 84.21% of the vote as he easily defeated independent candidate Bryan Kelly. Taylor's philosophy generally resembles that of his predecessor, John Hieftje, including his emphases on development, infrastructure, and the relationship between the city and the University of Michigan." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lance Timothy Evers (/ˈɛvərs/; born April 3, 1969), known professionally by his ring name Lance Storm, is a Canadian retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he held a combined 13 total championships (including holding three titles simultaneously in WCW). Storm started his career in 1990, training with Chris Jericho. They worked together in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), forming a tag team known as the Thrillseekers. In 1997, Storm joined ECW, where he worked with Justin Credible as The Impact Players. He stayed with ECW until 2000, then signed with World Championship Wrestling. In WCW, Storm won the United States, Cruiserweight and Hardcore Championships at the same time, renaming them as Canadian, 100 kg and Under Championship, and Saskatchewan Hardcore International Title. When WCW closed, his contract was bought by World Wrestling Federation (WWF), being involved in The Invasion storyline. He kept wrestling with WWF (later WWE) until 2005, when he left. Since then, Storm focused on the independent circuit as well as his training school, the Storm Wrestling Academy, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada." ;

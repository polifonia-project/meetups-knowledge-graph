        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jonathan Hay (born December 16, 1975) is an American publicist and record producer. His music career started in the 1990s when he stumbled upon a recording studio while attending college in Louisville, Kentucky. Hay is most known for his work with \"Pon de Replay\", the debut single from Rihanna. He has produced six albums and a single that topped the Billboard charts in multiple genres including hip hop and jazz. Hay's Follow the Leader (Reimagined As Jazz), a collaboration album with Eric B. & Rakim ended Michael Bubl√©'s 38 week reign at the top of the Billboard charts and remained for 11 consecutive weeks." ;

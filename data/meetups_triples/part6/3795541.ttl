        mtp:hasAbstract        "Steven Richard Flack (born 29 May 1971) is an English former professional footballer who played in the Football League for Cardiff City and Exeter City. After playing amateur football as a teenager in Cambridgeshire, he attracted attention from several Football League clubs and signed for Cardiff City in November 1995 for Â£10,000. However, after making eleven appearances for the side, he was sold to Exeter City for the same price the following year. Flack remained with Exeter for ten years, making over 400 appearances in all competitions and becoming the club's fourth highest league goalscorer of all-time. He later briefly played for non-league sides Tiverton Town and Dorchester Town." ;

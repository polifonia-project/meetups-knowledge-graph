        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julia Wolfe (born December 18, 1958) is an American composer and professor of music at New York University. According to The Wall Street Journal, Wolfe's music has \"long inhabited a terrain of its own, a place where classical forms are recharged by the repetitive patterns of minimalism and the driving energy of rock\". Her work Anthracite Fields, an oratorio for chorus and instruments, was awarded the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Music. She has also received the Herb Alpert Award (2015) and was named a MacArthur Fellow (2016)." ;

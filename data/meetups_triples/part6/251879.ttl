        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alan Stuart Franken (born May 21, 1951) is an American comedian, politician, media personality, and author who served as a United States senator from Minnesota from 2009 to 2018. He gained fame as a writer and performer on the television comedy show Saturday Night Live, where he worked from the 1970s until the 1990s. After decades as an entertainer, he became a prominent liberal political activist, hosting The Al Franken Show on Air America Radio. Franken was elected to the United States Senate in 2008 as the nominee of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL, an affiliate of the Democratic Party), defeating incumbent Republican Senator Norm Coleman by 312 votes out of nearly three million cast (a margin of just over 0.01%) in one of the closest elections in the history of the Senate. He was reelected in 2014 with 53.2% of the vote over Republican challenger Mike McFadden. Franken resigned on January 2, 2018, after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him. In September 2019, Franken announced he would be hosting The Al Franken Show Saturday mornings on SiriusXM radio. It covers global affairs, politics, the 2020 presidential election, and entertainment. In September 2021, Franken began a 15-city live tour, his first since semi-retiring from comedy during his time in the Senate." ;

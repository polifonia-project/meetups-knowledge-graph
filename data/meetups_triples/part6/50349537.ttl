        mtp:hasAbstract        "Antonio \"Toño\" Hernández Arriaga (February 9, 1934 – October 13, 1993) was a Mexican professional wrestler or luchador best known under the ring name El Espectro I (\"The Ghost\"), at times referred to as Espectro de Ultratumba (\"The ghost from beyond the grave\"). As Espectro I, Hernández became famous for his theatrical, elaborate entrances often involving being carried to the ring in a coffin. He has been cited as one of the most charismatic wrestlers of the 1950s, creating a character that inspired multiple successors including his sons who worked as (\"Son of Espectro\") and . He also inspired his nephew Antonio Peña who became the first wrestler to work as Espectro Jr. and later used the creativity and inspiration of the Espanto character to create Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, later known simply as \"AAA\". Hernández is one of a limited number of enmascarados, or masked wrestlers, to voluntarily unmask, option to remove the mask as he announced his retirement due to injuries. He would later return to wrestling but, without the mask, the Espectro character did not have the same impact. He later became a trainer, having trained such wrestlers as Fuerza Guerrera and the current Espectro Jr." ;

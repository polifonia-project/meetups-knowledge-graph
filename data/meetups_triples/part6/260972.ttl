        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maximilian II (28 November 1811 â€“ 10 March 1864) reigned as King of Bavaria between 1848 and 1864. Unlike his father, King Ludwig I, \"King Max\" was very popular and took a greater interest in the business of Government than in personal extravagance. Ascending the throne during the German Revolution of 1848, King Maximilian restored stability in his kingdom. The rest of his reign was characterized by attempts to maintain Bavarian independence during the wars of German Unification and to transform his capital city of Munich into a cultural and educational city." ;

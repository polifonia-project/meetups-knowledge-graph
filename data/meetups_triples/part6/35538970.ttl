        mtp:hasAbstract        "Shahid Khan (Urdu: شاهد خان; born 1 January 1981), better known by his stage name Naughty Boy, is a British DJ, record producer, songwriter and musician. In 2012, Khan signed a three–year publishing deal with Sony ATV, as well as a recording contract to release one album under Virgin EMI Records. Khan launched himself as a record producer under the moniker \"Naughty Boy\" and runs his own production company called Naughty Boy Recordings. He has produced two records for rappers Chipmunk and Wiley, both featuring Emeli Sandé. Naughty Boy and Sandé later formed a writing and production partnership, leading to Sandé landing her own record deal with Virgin and EMI. Sandé went on to be named the Critics Choice for the 2012 BRIT Awards, and release her debut album Our Version of Events (2012), a record co-written and produced with Naughty Boy. Khan spent 2011 and 2012 working on records for Leona Lewis, JLS, Cheryl, Jennifer Hudson, Alesha Dixon and Tinie Tempah, among others. In 2013, Naughty Boy released his debut album Hotel Cabana. The set features prominent collaborator Sandé, as well as Ed Sheeran, Gabrielle and others. It was preceded by the release of the top-ten single \"Wonder\" (featuring Sandé), the number one hit \"La La La\", featuring Sam Smith and \"Lifted\", another collaboration with Sandé. His debut album peaked at number two in the UK. On 19 October 2013, Naughty Boy's \"La La La\" was awarded 'Best Song' and 'Best Video' at the MOBO Awards' 18th Anniversary." ;

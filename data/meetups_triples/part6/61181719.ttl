He is the editor-at-large of The Post Millennial, a Canadian conservative news website. A regular guest on Fox News, Ngo has published columns in the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal. Ngo's coverage of antifa and Muslims has been controversial, and the accuracy and credibility of his reporting have been disputed by other journalists. He has been frequently accused of sharing misleading or selective material and described as a provocateur." ;

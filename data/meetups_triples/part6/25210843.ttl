        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bahman Mirza (Persian: بهمن میرزا;‎ 11 October 1810 – 11 February 1884) was an Iranian prince from the Qajar dynasty. The son of Abbas Mirza and grandson of Fath Ali Shah, he was Vicergerent (vali) of Azerbaijan and Governor-General of Tabriz. He later migrated to neighboring Imperial Russia, where he was received with great honour and lived a prestigious life in Shusha. Many of his offspring either returned to Iran where they pursued political or military careers, or served in the Russian military, and later played an important role in the military of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. He is also the great-grandfather of Afrasiyab Badalbeyli, Azerbaijani composer and author of the first Azeri balet and the first ballet in the Muslim East. Bahman Mirza is the ancestor of the Bahmani family with the branches of the Russian Princes Persidskii, and the Bahmanov and Kadjar lines of Azerbaijan as well as of the Iranian families Bahmani-Qajar and Bahman. Thus, Bahman Mirza was also the (great-)grandfather of Ambassador Ali Akbar Bahman." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Malcolm Harris (born September 6, 1991) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Virginia Cavaliers, before being selected with the 33rd overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was signed by the Nets in 2016, and is one of three players to make 200 three-pointers in one season in the history of the Nets franchise. The longest-tenured Net as of 2021, Harris led the NBA in three-point shooting accuracy in 2018–19 and repeated the feat in 2020–21. Also in 2021, Harris surpassed Drazen Petrovic as the Nets' all-time leader in three-point field goal percentage, and surpassed Jason Kidd as the Nets' all-time leader in three-point field goals made. Harris also currently ranks fourth in NBA history in career three-point field goal percentage." ;

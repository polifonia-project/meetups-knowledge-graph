She has been listed as the second-richest Black woman in the United States. She founded the media company Radio One (now known as Urban One), and when the company went public in 1999, she became the first African-American woman to head a publicly traded corporation. In the 1970s, Hughes created the urban radio format called \"The Quiet Storm\" on Howard University's radio station WHUR with disc jockey and fellow Howard student Melvin Lindsey." ;

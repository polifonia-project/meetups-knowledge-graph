        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martin John Lambie-Nairn (5 August 1945 â€“ 25 December 2020) was an English designer. He was the founder of his branding agency Lambie-Nairn and was the creative director of branding agency ML-N. He is recognised for having redefined television brand identity design, being the first to embrace computer technologies to apply branding to screen-based media. Lambie-Nairn was also a co-creator of 1980s satirical puppet show Spitting Image. Amongst his most prominent works are the original Channel 4 logo and idents created in 1982, the batch of over 30 idents for BBC Two that first aired on 16 February 1991, the 1997 corporate re-brand for the whole BBC, and the 2008 BBC Regional News titles. In conjunction with his agency, he also created launch packages for certain other BBC channels." ;

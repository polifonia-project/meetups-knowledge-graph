        mtp:hasAbstract        "Knute Kenneth Rockne (/kəˈnuːt ˈrɒkni/ kə-NOOT ROK-nee; March 4, 1888 – March 31, 1931) was a Norwegian-American player and coach of American football at the University of Notre Dame. Leading Notre Dame for 13 seasons, Rockne would accumulate over 100 wins and three national championships. Rockne is regarded as one of the greatest coaches in college football history. His biography at the College Football Hall of Fame, where he was inducted in 1951, identifies him as \"without question, American football's most-renowned coach\". Rockne helped to popularize the forward pass and made the Notre Dame Fighting Irish a major factor in college football. In 1931, at the age of 43, Rockne died in a plane crash." ;

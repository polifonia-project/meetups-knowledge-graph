        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ariel Aquino Muhlach (Tagalog pronunciation: [Ëˆmulak]; born August 12, 1969), popularly known as Aga Muhlach, is a Filipino actor. He has received numerous local and international accolades throughout his career, including Star Awards, Maria Clara Awards, and FAMAS Award. He was introduced to the entertainment industry using his real name \"Ariel Muhlach\" at the age of seven when he appeared in the 1975 film May Isang Tsuper ng Taksi and the 1976 film, Babaing Hiwalay Sa Asawa, but he only became well known (under his new screen name \"Aga Muhlach\") with the success of the 1984 film Bagets, after which he became a popular matinee idol. He also unsuccessfully ran for a 2013 congressional seat in Camarines Sur. As of October 2015, during the 60th birthday of ABS-CBN President Charo Santos-Concio, Muhlach confirmed that he has returned to original home network ABS-CBN after more than three years with TV5." ;

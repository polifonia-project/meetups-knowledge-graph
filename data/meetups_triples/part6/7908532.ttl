        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrew Jacob Hiebert (1 March 1963 â€“ 16 June 2022), known professionally as Big Rude Jake, was a Canadian songwriter, singer, musician, and bandleader based in Toronto. The original \"Swing Punk\", he was associated with the neo-swing trend of the 1990s. Jake was drawn to the roots of American music, and incorporated elements of jazz, blues, gospel, jump, and rockabilly, among others. His finger picking ragtime guitar style was inspired by the likes of Mose Scarlet and Leon Redbone. Jake stepped away from recording and touring for several years, during which time he began practicing Zen Buddhism. He returned in 2009 with a new album, Quicksand. He started touring Canada and Europe again in 2010, as well as playing in the United States." ;

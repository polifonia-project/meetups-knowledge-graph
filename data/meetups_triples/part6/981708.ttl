He was a notable campaigner for New Zealand self-government, and is generally regarded as having been the country's first premier (an office that would later be titled \"Prime Minister\"), having led the Sewell Ministry in 1856. He later served as Colonial Treasurer (1856–59), as Attorney-General (1861–62), and twice as Minister of Justice (1864–65, 1869–72)." ;

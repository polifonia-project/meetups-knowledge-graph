        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rory William Quigley (born January 26, 1987), known professionally as Harry Fraud, is an American record producer. Primarily a hip hop producer, Fraud began producing at an early age and began interning at a recording studio after graduating high school. First discovered by French Montana during a recording session in Chinatown in early 2009, Fraud has gone on to become a fixture in the New York underground and mixtape scene. He gained mainstream attention when his song with French Montana \"Shot Caller\" became one of the most added tracks on urban contemporary radio during 2011â€“2012. Fraud has produced collaborative records with various rappers, such as Flight 2011 (2011) with Chinx Drugz; Rugby Thompson (2012) with Smoke DZA; Cigarette Boats (2012) with Currensy, which was awarded XXL's \"2012 EP of the Year\"; Saaab Stories (2013) with Action Bronson, which served as the latter's major-label debut, and The Appetizer (2014) with French Montana. On March 8, 2013, he released his debut mixtape Adrift. That same year, Fraud teamed up with car-maker Scion to produce the compilation EP Scion A/V Presents: High Tide released on May 7, and on May 10 released his instrumental EP Royal Palm. In April 2014, he released his instrumental EP Blue/Green. Fraud has done production for various high-profile artists such as Rick Ross, Prodigy, Pusha T, Playboi Carti and Talib Kweli, among others. He has also worked on production for the International Emmy Awards." ;

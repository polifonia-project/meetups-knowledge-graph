Widely regarded as the central figure in the development of the new classical approach to macroeconomics, he received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1995 \"for having developed and applied the hypothesis of rational expectations, and thereby having transformed macroeconomic analysis and deepened our understanding of economic policy\". He has been characterized by N. Gregory Mankiw as \"the most influential macroeconomist of the last quarter of the 20th century.\" As of 2020, he ranks as the 11th most cited economist in the world." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clarence Weatherspoon, Sr. (born September 8, 1970) is a former American professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) born in Crawford, Mississippi. He is currently the assistant coach for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles. At the University of Southern Mississippi, Weatherspoon was a three-time Metro Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year, the only player in conference history to achieve the feat three times. He was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers as the ninth pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He played for the 76ers, the Golden State Warriors, the Miami Heat, the Cleveland Cavaliers, the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets, averaging 11.5 points per game throughout his career. At six-foot-seven-inches and 250 pounds (201 cm, 113 kg), he was nicknamed \"Baby Barkley\" early during his career due to a similar aggressive playing style attributed to fellow short-statured NBA power forward and former 76er, Charles Barkley. He participated in the 1993 Slam Dunk contest, finishing second to Harold Miner with an overall score of 92." ;

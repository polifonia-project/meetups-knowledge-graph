        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mia Martini (Italian pronunciation: [ˈmiːa marˈtiːni]; born Domenica Rita Adriana Bertè [doˈmeːnika berˈtɛ]; 20 September 1947 – 12 May 1995) was an Italian singer, songwriter and musician. She is considered, by many experts, one of the most important and expressive female voices of Italian music, characterised by her interpretative intensity and her soulful performance. Her debut album, Oltre la collina with the song \"Padre davvero\" is regarded as one of the best Italian albums made by a female artist. Hit songs like \"Piccolo uomo\", \"Donna sola\", \"Minuetto\", \"Inno\", \"Al mondo\", \"Che vuoi che sia se t'ho aspettato tanto\", \"Per amarti\" and \"La costruzione di un amore\" made her one of the most popular artists of Italian music in the 1970s, a decade in which she reached popularity both nationally and internationally. She is the only female artist to have won two Festivalbar consecutively, respectively in 1972 and in 1973. In 1977, two important encounters occurred in Mia Martini's life: the first one is with Charles Aznavour, with whom she will start a musical collaboration; the second encounter is with singer-songwriter Ivano Fossati, with whom she will start an artistic and sentimental partnership. She returned to the music scenes in 1981, after she underwent two surgeries at her vocal cords that changed her vocal timbre and extension. In 1982, she sang \"E non finisce mica il cielo\", written by Fossati, at Sanremo Music Festival, where she received the Critics Award, which was created specifically for her interpretation and which was named after her as \"Mia Martini\" Critics Awards from 1996, the year after her death. In 1983, she was forced to leave the music industry and quit her career, by the music sector and by her colleagues, who considered her a person bringing bad luck and barred her to participate at any music and TV events, radio shows and concerts. This slander kept her away from the music scene for seven years and only in 1989, she was able to reprise her career, when she returned to perform at Sanremo Music Festival, singing \"Almeno tu nell'universo\", which brought her a new success. In the following years, Mia Martini had new hits like \"Gli uomini non cambiano\", \"La nevicata del '56\" and \"Cu' mme\", the latter with Roberto Murolo.She represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest twice, in 1977 with the song Libera and in 1992 with the song Rapsodia. She died on 12 May 1995 in Cardano al Campo at the age of 47." ;

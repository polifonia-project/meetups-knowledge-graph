        mtp:hasAbstract        "Felix Roque is a Cuban-American medical doctor, U.S. Army Reserve colonel, and Democratic Party politician, and former Mayor of West New York, New Jersey. The five-person slate he led defeated a slate headed by Mayor Silverio Vega in the May 10, 2011 general election and his running mates chose Roque to serve as the town's mayor. Subsequently, to this, his allegiance with Commissioner Count Wiley, who had previously helped him unseat Vega, soured, and Wiley was his chief opponent in the May 2015 election, which Roque won. In 2012 the Hudson Reporter named him #50 in its list of Hudson County's 50 most influential people. In 2013 he was ranked #57, and in 2014 he and Deputy Mayor Silvio Acosta were tied for #30. Roque lost his May 2019 re-election bid. Unwillng to concede and contesting the results, he filed for a recount." ;

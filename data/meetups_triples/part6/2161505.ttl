        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stephen Crawford (born 9 January 1974) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player, who is the current assistant manager of Dundee United. Crawford started his career with Raith Rovers, with whom he won the 1994 Scottish League Cup Final and played in the UEFA Cup. This earned him a move to English football with Millwall, but Crawford returned to Scotland after just one year. He had a mixed spell with Hibernian, suffering relegation but then winning promotion. Crawford then had the most productive spell of his career with Dunfermline Athletic, during which time he became a Scotland regular, amassing 25 caps in total. Crawford played in three Scottish Cup Finals (two for Dunfermline and one for Dundee United) in the mid-2000s, losing all three to Celtic. Crawford's stint with Dundee United came after a short-lived return to English football with Plymouth Argyle. After short spells with Aberdeen and Dunfermline Athletic, Crawford signed for lower division club East Fife in 2008. He served East Fife as player/manager for just over a year before resigning as manager in October 2010. After stints as an assistant manager at Falkirk, Hearts and Milton Keynes Dons, he managed Dunfermline Athletic for two years. After a second spell as East Fife manager, Crawford joined Dundee United as assistant manager in September 2022." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rycklon Stephens (born April 22, 1978) is a Guyanese-American retired professional wrestler and bodybuilder. He is best known for his time with WWE under the ring name Ezekiel Jackson, where he was the final ECW Champion under the WWE brand of the same name, and a former Intercontinental Champion. Stephens made his professional wrestling debut for the California based promotion Ultimate Pro Wrestling in 2007 under the ring name Big Ryck Hytz. He was then signed by the WWE in 2007 and sent to Florida Championship Wrestling under the new ring name Rycklon which was later changed to Ezekiel Jackson after his main-roster debut in 2008. During his time in WWE, Jackson was the final man to win the ECW Championship making him the third African-American to hold the championship, the sixth black world champion (after The Rock, Booker T, Bobby Lashley, Ron Simmons and Mark Henry) and the only South American-born world champion in WWE history, he later joined The Corre but was kicked out, thus starting a feud with the stable's leader Wade Barrett and he would go on to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Jackson would leave WWE in 2014 and briefly wrestle for TNA in the same year. He also competed in one season of Lucha Underground as Big Ryck from 2014-2015.

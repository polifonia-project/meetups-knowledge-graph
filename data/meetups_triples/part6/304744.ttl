        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Bell Hatcher (October 11, 1861 â€“ July 3, 1904) was an American paleontologist and fossil hunter known as the \"king of collectors\" and best known for discovering Torosaurus and Triceratops, two genera of dinosaurs described by Othniel Charles Marsh. He was part of a new, professional middle class in American science, having financed his education with his labor while also being more educated than older fossil collectors. As such, he faced unique challenges throughout his long and productive career." ;

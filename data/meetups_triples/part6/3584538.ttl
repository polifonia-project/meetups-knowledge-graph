        mtp:hasAbstract        "Josiah Kirby Lilly Sr. (November 18, 1861 – February 8, 1948), nicknamed \"J. K.,\" was an American businessman, pharmaceutical industrialist, and philanthropist who became president and chairman of the board of Eli Lilly and Company, the pharmaceutical firm his father, Colonel Eli Lilly, founded in 1876. Josiah, the colonel's sole heir, began working at his father’s company at the age of fourteen. He graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science and became superintendent of the Lilly laboratories in 1882 and company president in 1898. Under his leadership, the company introduced standardized manufacturing processes, expanded its sales force, and increased its research efforts to develop new drugs. Eli Lilly and Company grew into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Lilly’s eldest son, Eli Jr., succeeded him as president in 1932. His younger son, Josiah Jr. (\"Joe\"), succeeded Eli as company president in 1948. J. K. served as chairman of the board from 1932 until his death in 1948. Lilly was also a philanthropist who supported the projects of charitable and civic organizations in Indianapolis and in Indiana. Lily and his two sons established the Lilly Endowment in 1937 with Eli Lilly and Company stock valued as $280,000. It became one of the largest charitable foundations in the world, and today continues the Lilly family's legacy of philanthropy. Lilly also amassed a significant collection of composer Stephen Foster's music and Foster memorabilia, which he donated to the University of Pittsburgh in 1937." ;

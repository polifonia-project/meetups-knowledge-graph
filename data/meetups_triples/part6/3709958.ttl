        mtp:hasAbstract        "Anita Hegerland (born 3 March 1961 in Sandefjord) is Norway's biggest selling solo artist. She is a singer, most known for her childhood career in Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and subsequent vocal contributions to Mike Oldfield's work, among others. She is one of Norway's best-selling female artists in history. In 1971, she was, along with Michael Jackson, one of the world's best-selling child singers. At age 10, she became Norway's first artist to sell over a million copies. She is one of the best-selling solo singers in Norway, with sales of more than 7 million albums and singles. Her songs have been released on nearly 30 million albums worldwide, most of which are with Roy Black and Mike Oldfield. She is also an actress and has appeared in Norwegian, German, Swiss, and Austrian films and television series. She has participated in Melodi Grand Prix in 1971 («Gi meg en zebra»), 1972 («Happy Hippie»), 1983 («Nå er jeg alene»), and in 2009 («Party»). She came in as number four in 1971 and number three in 1972. Hegerland had the biggest hit in Germany of any Norwegian artist ever, in front of Lene Nystrøm (AQUA), Marit Larsen, Madcon, and A-ha. For more than 20 years she had the record in Sweden as the singer who was the longest on Svensktoppen, the main music charts." ;

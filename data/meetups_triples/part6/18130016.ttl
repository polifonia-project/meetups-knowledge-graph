        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles John Dempsey CBE (4 March 1921 â€“ 24 June 2008) was a Scottish-born New Zealand association football administrator who in July 2000 abstained from FIFA's final round of voting for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in a move which eventually saw the competition being awarded to Germany rather than South Africa. He was once described as \"Oceania's Flying Scotsman\" at the 50th FIFA Congress in Zurich in August 1996. Dempsey said that he did not vote because of the \"intolerable pressure\" from supporters of the German and South African bids, and of the attempts that had been made to bribe him. FIFA rejected calls for a new vote and opened an internal inquiry into the allegations of corruption. He stood down from his role in September 2000 as he was unable to accept what had taken place over the days after the vote." ;

She is known for her bluesy rock voice, on such tracks as \"Ladykiller\", and the Buk single, \"Slay Me Like a Lady\". Darren has released eleven albums to date, plus she has been featured on various other albums and compilations. Her style is unique, being one of the few female classic rock vocalists. Although she never had a hit record, a recording she was part of \"The dream of Olwen\" by Second City Sound entered the top 50 at number 43 in 1969." ;

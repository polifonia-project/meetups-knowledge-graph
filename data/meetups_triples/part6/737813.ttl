        mtp:hasAbstract        "Otto Eduard Neugebauer (May 26, 1899 â€“ February 19, 1990) was an Austrian-American mathematician and historian of science who became known for his research on the history of astronomy and the other exact sciences as they were practiced in antiquity and the Middle Ages. By studying clay tablets, he discovered that the ancient Babylonians knew much more about mathematics and astronomy than had been previously realized. The National Academy of Sciences has called Neugebauer \"the most original and productive scholar of the history of the exact sciences, perhaps of the history of science, of our age.\"" ;

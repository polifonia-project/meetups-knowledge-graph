        mtp:hasAbstract        "Timothy Richard Tebow (/ˈtiːboʊ/; born August 14, 1987) is an American football player who is a free agent. He previously played three seasons in the National Football League (NFL) as a quarterback, most notably with the Denver Broncos. Tebow played college football at Florida, where he became the first underclassman to win the Heisman Trophy and led his team to two BCS National Championship victories in 2007 and 2009. At the conclusion of his collegiate career, he held the Southeastern Conference's records for career passing efficiency and rushing touchdowns. Selected by the Broncos in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft, Tebow became their starter during the 2011 season. His tenure revitalized a struggling team, leading them to their first division title and playoff victory since 2005. Questions over Tebow's future potential, however, resulted in him being traded the following offseason to the New York Jets, where he spent one year as a backup. After failing to make the final roster of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, Tebow pursued a minor league baseball career with the New York Mets organization from 2016 to 2021. The same year he retired from baseball, Tebow returned to the NFL as a tight end for the Jacksonville Jaguars, but was released after one preseason game. Known for his outspoken Christian faith, Tebow became a cultural phenomenon with the 2011 Broncos. His propensity for kneeling on football fields led to his form of prayer receiving the neologism \"Tebowing\"." ;

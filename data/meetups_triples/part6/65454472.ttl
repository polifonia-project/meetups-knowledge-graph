        mtp:hasAbstract        "Natalia Peluso (born 12 January 1995), known professionally as Nathy Peluso (Spanish: [ˌnati peˈluso]), is an Argentinian singer, songwriter, dancer and pedagogue. Born in Argentina, and raised in Spain, Peluso became interested in the performing arts at an early age, performing cover songs at musical bars in her teenage years. After graduating King Juan Carlos University, Peluso relocated to Barcelona to pursue a professional career in music, with her first releases, Esmeralda (2017) and La Sandunguera (2018), being confected independently. Peluso slowly started to become recognized in Spain. After signing Sony Music, Peluso started working on her breakthrough album Calambre (2020), for which she won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Distinguished for her theatrical personality onstage, and her fusion of hip hop, soul, and world music, Peluso's popularity expanded after collaborating with Bizarrap on \"Nasty Girl\", achieving commercial success and social media virality in Latin America. She has also collaborated with Christina Aguilera, Karol G, and C. Tangana, with the latter one's duet \"Ateo\" debuting atop the Spanish charts. Peluso's artistry has been awarded four Premios Gardel and a Latin Grammy Award out of six nominations, including Best New Artist, among many others." ;

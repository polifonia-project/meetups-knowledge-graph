        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Hunter Coleman (September 26, 1890 â€“ July 16, 1959) was an American catcher, coach and manager in Major League Baseball. He also was one of the most successful managers in the history of minor league baseball. During a career that extended (with interruptions caused by Major League service) from 1919 through 1957, he won ten regular season pennants and five league titles. He won his first pennant with the 1922 Terre Haute Tots of the Three-I League, and he also won a championship with the 1935 Springfield Senators, also of the Three-I League. The rest of his titles came with the Evansville, Indiana, franchises in the Three-I League." ;

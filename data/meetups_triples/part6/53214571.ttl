        mtp:hasAbstract        "Greg Budgett (b. c. 1952) is a Cleveland, Ohio-based comic book artist known particularly for his work illustrating the comics of Harvey Pekar. Most of Budgett's work on Pekar's American Splendor and other comics has been in partnership with Gary Dumm, who has inked most of Budgett's stories. Budgett attended Ohio State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. Pekar and Budgett began working together in 1974; before American Splendor, Budgett illustrated a couple of short Pekar stories (one of them in partnership with Dumm) in the underground comix anthologies and Flaming Baloney X. From 1976 until 1988, Budgett illustrated stories in Pekar's autobiographical comics series, American Splendor. Budgett was one of Pekar's most frequent early collaborators; most of his stories were inked by Dumm. Budgett drew a number of American Splendor covers as well, including issues #2, 3, 7, 8, 11, and 13. During the 1980s, Budgett and Dumm worked on stories in Dr. Wirtham's Comix & Stories, an underground/alternative comics series published by , as well as a number of other alternative and independent comic book series. In the early 1990s, Budgett and Dumm co-wrote and drew stories for Eternity Comics' Plan 9 from Outer Space: Thirty Years Later and their own erotic series Shooty Beagle and Woofers & Hooters (both with Eros Comix). By the early 1990s, Budgett had \"de-emphasized cartooning\" and didn't work in the industry again until 2004, when (at the urging of Gary Dumm) he illustrated another Pekar story in the 2004 collection American Splendor: Our Movie Year. He was a regular contributor to Vertigo's two American Splendor limited series in 2006â€“2008." ;

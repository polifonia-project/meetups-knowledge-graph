Known professionally as a comic, his first regular television role was on the short-lived but influential Ben Stiller Show. In the mid-1990s, he had a long-running stint on NBC's NewsRadio and was a supporting character on Less than Perfect. He briefly had his own program, The Andy Dick Show, on MTV. He is noted for his outlandish behavior on a number of Comedy Central Roasts and other appearances. He is also known for his eccentric behavior, struggles with drug addiction, and numerous sexual misconduct allegations and arrests." ;

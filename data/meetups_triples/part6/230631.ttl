        mtp:hasAbstract        "Asger Oluf Jorn (3 March 1914 – 1 May 1973) was a Danish painter, sculptor, ceramic artist, and author. He was a founding member of the avant-garde movement COBRA and the Situationist International. He was born in , in the northwest corner of Jutland, Denmark, and baptized Asger Oluf Jørgensen. The largest collection of Jorn's works—including his major work Stalingrad—can be seen in the Museum Jorn, Silkeborg, Denmark. Jorn willed his property and the works of art located inside to the Municipality of Albissola Marina (Savona), so the Italian museum called \"Casa Museo Jorn\" was created for displaying his works." ;

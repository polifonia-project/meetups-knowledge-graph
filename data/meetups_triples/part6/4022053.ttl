In 2021, he was one of three co-creators for the Peacock comedy series Rutherford Falls. Schur's comedies typically include large, diverse casts; break-out stars have emerged from his shows. He features optimistic characters who often find strong friendships and lasting love, through plots that showcase \"good-hearted humanistic warmth.\" As of September 2021, Schur has been nominated for 19 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning two for his work on Saturday Night Live (1997â€“2004) and The Office." ;

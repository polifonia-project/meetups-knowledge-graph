She brings the weather for the weekend news at 6 and 10 p.m. on WNYW in New York City. She also fills in on Good Day New York. She is the daughter of musician, songwriter and record producer Tito Puente, and the sister of musician Tito Puente, Jr.. Puente succeeded WWOR-TV veteran meteorologist Storm Field in January 2007 as the station's main meteorologist, and served in that capacity until WWOR cancelled the evening newscast in July 2013. She has been the weekend meteorologist at WNYW since late 2012, and the main fill-in meteorologist for the channel. She previously provided weather forecasts for WCBS-TV's Channel 2 News This Morning and CBS 2 News at Noon. On January 1, 2007 WCBS hired John Elliott to take her position. Before WCBS she worked as the weekend morning meteorologist for WNBC since 1999. In the mid-1990s, she was a meteorologist at WJCL and WTGS television in Savannah, Georgia, and WAPT in Jackson, Mississippi. She also periodically filled in for Dave Price on CBS's The Early Show. Puente is a graduate of Syracuse University, where she received a Bachelor of Science degree in Speech Communication. She received her Masters of Science in Geosciences with an emphasis on meteorology from Mississippi State University. Puente has been married to Jay Thompson since September 18, 2004.

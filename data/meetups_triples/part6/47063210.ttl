        mtp:hasAbstract        "Archie Alleyne CM (January 7, 1933 â€“ June 8, 2015) was a Canadian jazz drummer. Best known as a drummer for influential jazz musicians such as Billie Holiday, Lester Young, Stan Getz, Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster, he was also prominent as a recording artist on his own and with Canadian jazz musicians such as Oliver Jones, Cy McLean and Brian Browne. Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Alleyne became the house drummer at the Town Tavern jazz club in his 20s. Following a serious car accident in 1967, Alleyne stepped away from music for a number of years, becoming a partner with Dave Mann, John Henry Jackson and Howard Matthews in The Underground Railroad, a soul food restaurant in Toronto. After being bought out of the restaurant in 1981, he returned to music in the early 1980s with Jones' band. Alleyne was named to the Order of Canada in 2011. He established the Archie Alleyne Scholarship Fund to provide bursaries to music students, and wrote Colour Me Jazz: The Archie Alleyne Story, an autobiography which was published a few months after his death." ;

He frequently performs in ethnic languages, though mostly Setswana. Tuks Senganga started writing in 1993, drawing inspiration from everyday issues in his immediate environment. His career took off in 2005 with his first album Mafoko A Me. This was the album that earned him the Best Hip Hop Album Award at the 12th Annual MTN South African Music Awards (SAMA)." ;

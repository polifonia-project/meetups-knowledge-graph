Magnus' contribution was especially considerable on the 1981 album Cured, which he co-produced, and on which he co-wrote (with Hackett) one song, \"Funny Feeling\", and also programmed the famous Linn LM-1 drum machine. Nick Magnus studied piano from years 6-15, cathedral organ from 15-18, self-taught thereafter. He started his professional musical career in early 1976 with the symphonic rock band, The Enid.

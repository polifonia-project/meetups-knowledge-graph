        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dionysius Lardner \"Dion\" Boucicault /ˈdaɪˌɒn ˈbuːsɪˌkoʊ/ (né Boursiquot; 26 December 1820 – 18 September 1890) was an Irish actor and playwright famed for his melodramas. By the later part of the 19th century, Boucicault had become known on both sides of the Atlantic as one of the most successful actor-playwright-managers then in the English-speaking theatre. Although The New York Times hailed him in his obituary as \"the most conspicuous English dramatist of the 19th century,\" he and his second wife, Agnes Robertson Boucicault, had applied for and received American citizenship in 1873." ;

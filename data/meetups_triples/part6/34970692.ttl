        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ruth Welting (November 5, 1948 â€“ December 16, 1999) was an American operatic soprano who had an active international career from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s. A specialist in the coloratura soprano repertoire, she was particularly associated with the Metropolitan Opera where she performed regularly from 1976 until her retirement from performance in 1994. Endowed with a powerful coloratura voice, she is remembered as one of a few sopranos capable of singing the Mad Scene (\"Il dolce suono\") from Lucia di Lammermoor in the original F major key." ;

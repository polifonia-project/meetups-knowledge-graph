Since 2020, she has been a judge on the ITV musical competition show The Masked Singer, and since 2021, a spin-off of the show, The Masked Dancer. After a difficult childhood, in her early twenties McCall had pursued various jobs, including becoming a singer and a model, but later embarked on a career on television with a first job presenting for MTV in 1992. After further work on terrestrial channels, she became a household name thanks to Big Brother, while also continuing to work with other hosting vehicles on various channels, such as game shows and talent shows. She was a regular co-presenter of the Comic Relief annual telethons from 2005 to 2015." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sister Christine or Christina Greenstidel (17 August 1866 â€“ 27 March 1930) was a school teacher, and close friend and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. On 24 February 1894, Christine attended a lecture of Vivekananda in Detroit, United States which inspired her. She started communicating with Vivekananda through letters. Christine went to India in 1902 and began working as a school teacher and a social worker. In 1911, after the death of Vivekananda's disciple Sister Nivedita, Christine took charge of Nivedita's girls' school. Some scholars of Vivekananda's life, including Sister Gargi and Pravrajika Vrajaprana, believe that Vivekananda regarded Christine as his daughter." ;

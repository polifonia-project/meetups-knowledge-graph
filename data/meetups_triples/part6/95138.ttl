        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hubert \"Cubby\" Selby Jr. (July 23, 1928 â€“ April 26, 2004) was an American writer. Two of his novels, Last Exit to Brooklyn (1964) and Requiem for a Dream (1978) explore worlds in the New York area and were adapted as films, both of which he appeared in. His first novel was prosecuted for obscenity in the United Kingdom and banned in Italy, prompting defences from many leading authors such as Anthony Burgess. He influenced multiple generations of writers. For more than 20 years, he taught creative writing at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he lived full-time after 1983." ;

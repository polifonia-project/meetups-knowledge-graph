        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Rogers (15 January 1887 â€“ 20 December 1956) was an English film actor, director and screenwriter, best known for his association with Laurel and Hardy. He was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England. In 1928, he joined the Laurel and Hardy crew on the Hal Roach lot, where he worked as actor, writer, and ultimately director. Although he was known informally as \"Charley,\" he was always billed on screen under his given name, Charles Rogers. In the 1940s, as an actor, Rogers was teamed briefly with Harry Langdon in feature films, and with Andy Clyde for a few short comedies. In 1956, Rogers died in Los Angeles, California, following injuries sustained in an automobile accident." ;

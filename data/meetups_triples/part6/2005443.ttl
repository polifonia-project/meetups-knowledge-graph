He was the leader of folk rock band Off Course from 1969 to 1989, and has done solo work since 1985. As the vocalist of Off Course, Oda wrote many Japanese standard numbers in the 70s and 80s. The group's most successful singles—\"Sayonara\" (1979), \"Yes-No\" (1980), and \"Kimi ga Uso o Tsuita\" (1984)—were written by Oda. In 1985 he began work as a solo musician. He produced many hit singles as singer-songwriter, such as \"Little Tokyo\" (1989), \"Itsuka Dokokade\" (1992), \"Tsutaetai Koto ga Arunda\" (1997) and \"Kirakira\" (2002). His most successful single was \"Love Story wa Totsuzen ni\" (1991), the theme song of a Japanese TV drama called Tokyo Love Story.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Clarke (24 December 1798 â€“ 25 August 1856) was an English cricketer and team manager who played first-class cricket from 1826 to 1855. He founded, managed and captained the All-England Eleven. He has been described as \"one of certain figures who, in the history of cricket, stand like milestones along the way\". Clarke was born at Nottingham and died at Wandsworth in Surrey. In the late 1820s, he lost sight in one eye after being struck there by a fives ball on the court behind the Bell Inn in Nottingham." ;

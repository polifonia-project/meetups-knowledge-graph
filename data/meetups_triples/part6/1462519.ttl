His mission was to kill Prince Qingji, who was taking refuge in the state of Wei. In order to pretend to be a criminal in the state of Wu, Yao Li killed his wife and his mother, and his right hand was cut off by King Helü. After his arrival in the state of Wei, he met Qingji and was able to stay in the same boat with his target. As the boat reached the middle of the river, he killed Qingji with a lance and then committed suicide." ;

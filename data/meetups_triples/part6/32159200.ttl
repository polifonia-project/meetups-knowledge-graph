After retiring from AFL, he became a successful bureaucrat of the New South Wales and Victorian school systems. Hearing about a large high school in rural South Australia in 2011, he quit his city job as Deputy Director General, Schools, for the NSW Department of Education and Training, to become the principal of Eastern Fleurieu School. At the end of 2017, Fletcher retired after successfully leading the school for six years." ;

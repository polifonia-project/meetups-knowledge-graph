        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ewanya \"Puff\" Johnson (December 10, 1972 â€“ June 24, 2013) was an American R&B singer-songwriter. Born in Detroit, she emerged on the music scene with her singles \"Forever More\" and \"Over and Over\", which experienced commercial success in Europe and Australia. These songs were included on her only album Miracle (1996). In the early- to mid-2000s, she was listed as a co-writer on several projects and relocated to South Africa where she began working on an unreleased second album. However, in March 2008 Johnson was diagnosed with cervical cancer and subsequently, five years later on June 24, 2013 died of the disease." ;

He was wealthy following his retirement from the candy business and used it to sponsor anti-communist causes. He co-founded the far right group the John Birch Society (JBS) in 1958 and tightly controlled it until his death. He was highly controversial and criticized by liberals, as well as some mainstream conservatives, including William F. Buckley Jr." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Giulia Farnese (1474 â€“ 23 March 1524) was an Italian noblewoman, a mistress to Pope Alexander VI, and the sister of Pope Paul III. Known as Giulia la bella, meaning \"Julia the beautiful\" in Italian, Giulia was a member of the noble Farnese family, who were prominent leaders in the Italian regions of Parma and Piacenza. After marrying into the noble Orsini family in the Papal States, Giulia soon acquainted herself with, and initiated an affair with, the Spanish Cardinal Rodrigo de Borja. When the cardinal was elected Pope, Giulia continued the increasingly advantageous liaison, which enabled her to have her brother Alessandro made a cardinal, until losing Alexander's favor at the turn of the century. Giulia spent most of her later years governing the castle of Carbognano, previously a property which Alexander had given to her husband. She died in 1524 in Rome at the residence belonging to Alessandro, who would later be elected Pope Paul III. Lorenzo Pucci described her as \"most lovely to behold\". Cesare Borgia, the son of Alexander VI, described her as having \"dark colouring, black eyes, round face and a particular ardor\"." ;

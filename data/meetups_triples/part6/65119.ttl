        mtp:hasAbstract        "Laozi (Chinese: 老子, Mandarin: [làu.tsɹ̩]; commonly translated as \"Old Master\"), also rendered as Lao Tzu (/ˈlaʊ ˈtsuː, -ˈdzʌ/), or Lao-Tze (/ˈlaʊ ˈdzeɪ/), proper name Li Er, courtesy name Boyang, was an ancient Chinese philosopher and writer. He is the reputed author of the Tao Te Ching, the founder of philosophical Taoism, and a deity in religious Taoism and traditional Chinese religions. A semi-legendary figure, Laozi is usually portrayed as a 6th-century BCE contemporary of Confucius in the Spring and Autumn period. Some modern historians consider him to have lived during the Warring States period of the 4th century BCE. A central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by various anti-authoritarian movements, and has had a profound impact on subsequent Chinese philosophers, who have both commended and criticized his work extensively." ;

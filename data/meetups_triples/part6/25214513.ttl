As Brett Domino, he is a musician and internet celebrity from Leeds, although Madin is actually from Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He is best known for his YouTube videos, in which he plays covers and original songs on various musical instruments, most notably the keytar. His band, The Brett Domino Trio, currently consists of only two members, Domino and \"Steven Peavis\" (Ste Anderson), having only been a three-piece for around a year. \"Mitch Hutchinson\" (Michael Denny) left the band in 2009, allegedly to become a forklift truck driver; he later returned to celebrate the band's fifth anniversary and appear on the finale of Brett Domino's Weekly YouTube Thing." ;

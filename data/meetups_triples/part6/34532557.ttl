He was appointed as a member of the suicide squad nominated by the First National Government in 1950 to vote for the abolition of the Council. Most of the new members (like Alexander) were appointed on 22 June 1950, and served until 31 December 1950 when the Council was abolished. In 1953, Alexander was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Larry Holley (June 28, 1945 – May 12, 2022) was an American college basketball coach. He was the head men's basketball coach at his alma mater, William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. His 919 career wins made him one of only 10 four-year college coaches (National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA)) to amass 900 career wins. He ranks first all-time in career wins among four-year, college coaches coaching only at Missouri colleges and universities. Holley's teams won 20 games in a season 24 times and have posted both a 45-game conference winning streak and a 43-game home court winning streak. He received 14 Coach of the Year awards and was elected to the Greater Kansas City Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame, the Missouri Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame, the NAIA Hall of Fame and the William Jewell College Athletic Hall of Fame. Holley joined William Jewell as head men's basketball coach for the 1979–80 season after coaching four years at Northwest Missouri State University, six years at Central Methodist University and one year at Harrisburg, Missouri High School. He was a native of Jameson, Missouri." ;

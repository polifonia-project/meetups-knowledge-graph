        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark Alan Roberts (born 16 October 1983) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender. Roberts started his career at Crewe Alexandra at the age of 11, and progressed through the club's academy; signing a professional contract at the age of 19. He played six times during his seven years for Crewe's first team, and was sent out on loan six times during his spell at the club. Following a loan spell at his hometown club, Northwich Victoria, he joined the club on a permanent basis in 2007. Roberts played 20 games for the Cheshire club during the second half of the 2006–07 season, before returning to the Football League with Accrington Stanley in summer 2007. He played 37 games for the club, before being loaned back to Northwich Victoria, a move which was later made permanent. During the 2008–09 season, Roberts joined Stevenage on an initial one-month loan agreement, before signing permanently in January 2009 for an undisclosed fee. That season, he was part of the team that won the FA Trophy in May 2009. Roberts was made team captain ahead of the 2009–10 season, a season in which Roberts would help lead the team to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. The following season, the club earned back-to-back promotions following their sixth-place finish and subsequent League Two play-off victory in May 2011. He also spent two spells as caretaker manager of the club, once in January 2012 and again in March 2013. After a successful four-and-a-half-year spell at Stevenage, Roberts joined Fleetwood Town on a free transfer in July 2013. He captained Fleetwood to promotion via the play-offs during his first season with the club. After two seasons at Fleetwood, Roberts joined League Two club Cambridge United in May 2015, where he spent two seasons. He subsequently spent the 2017–18 season at fellow League Two club Forest Green Rovers, before signing for Warrington Town of the Northern Premier League in August 2018. Roberts captained Warrington as they won the Northern Premier League play-offs in his first season there, although the club would ultimately be defeated in the step three super play-off final. He made 144 appearances over four years at Warrington, before announcing his retirement from playing in June 2022." ;

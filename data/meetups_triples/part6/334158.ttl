        mtp:hasAbstract        "Himiko (卑弥呼, c. 170–248 AD), also known as Shingi Waō (親魏倭王, \"Ruler of Wa, Friend of Wei\"), was a shamaness-queen of Yamatai-koku in Wakoku (倭国). Early Chinese dynastic histories chronicle tributary relations between Queen Himiko and the Cao Wei Kingdom (220–265) and record that the Yayoi period people chose her as ruler following decades of warfare among the kings of Wa. Early Japanese histories do not mention Himiko, but historians associate her with legendary figures such as Empress Consort Jingū, who was regent (c. 200–269) in roughly the same era as Himiko. Scholarly debates over the identity of Himiko and the location of her domain, Yamatai, have raged since the late Edo period, with opinions divided between northern Kyūshū or traditional Yamato Province in present-day Kinki. The \"Yamatai controversy\", writes Keiji Imamura, is \"the greatest debate over the ancient history of Japan.\" A prevailing view among scholars is that she may be buried at Hashihaka Kofun in Nara Prefecture." ;

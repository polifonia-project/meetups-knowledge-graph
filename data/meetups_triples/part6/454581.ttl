Clark is now renowned for his vintage designs by present-day designers. Clark is compared to the 1960s fashion great Biba and influenced many other designers, including Yves Saint Laurent, Anna Sui and Tom Ford. Manolo Blahnik has said of Ossie Clark's work: \"He created an incredible magic with the body and achieved what fashion should do—produce desire.\" Ossie Clark and Ossie Clark for Radley clothes are highly sought after, and are worn by well known models such as Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell." ;

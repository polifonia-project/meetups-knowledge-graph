        mtp:hasAbstract        "Flavius Claudius Constantius Gallus (326–354) was a statesman and ruler in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire from 351 to 354, as Caesar under emperor Constantius II (r. 337–61), his cousin. A grandson of emperor Constantius Chlorus (r. 293–306) and empress Flavia Maximiana Theodora, and a son of Julius Constantius and Galla, he belonged to the Constantinian dynasty. He was born during the reign of his uncle Constantine the Great (r. 306–37), and was among the few to survive the killings of male members of the imperial family in 337. Under Constantius II, he married Constantina, Constantine's daughter and Constantius' sister. As Caesar he dealt with a Jewish revolt (351–352) and ruled from Antioch, but the emperor came to mistrust him, and ultimately had him executed and replaced with his younger half-brother Julian." ;

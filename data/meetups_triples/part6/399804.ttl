        mtp:hasAbstract        "Avram Davidson (April 23, 1923 â€“ May 8, 1993) was an American writer of fantasy fiction, science fiction, and crime fiction, as well as the author of many stories that do not fit into a genre niche. He won a Hugo Award and three World Fantasy Awards in the science fiction and fantasy genre, a World Fantasy Life Achievement award, and an Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine short story award and an Edgar Award in the mystery genre. Davidson edited The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction from 1962 to 1964. His last novel was completed by Grania Davis and was a Nebula Award finalist in 1998. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction says \"he is perhaps sf's most explicitly literary author\"." ;

Dubbed \"Paparazzo Extraordinaire\" by Newsweek and \"the Godfather of the U.S. paparazzi culture\" by Time magazine and Vanity Fair, he is regarded by Harper's Bazaar as \"arguably the most controversial paparazzo of all time\". He photographed many celebrities out of the public eye and gained notice for his feuds with some of them, including Jacqueline Onassis and Marlon Brando. Despite the numerous controversies and claims of stalking, Galella's work was praised and exhibited in art galleries worldwide. During his career, Galella took more than three million photographs of public figures." ;

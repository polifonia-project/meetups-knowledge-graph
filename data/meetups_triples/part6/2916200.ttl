Her career spans more than six decades and three continents. She starred onstage in London's West End in The World of Suzie Wong and on Broadway in Golden Child. Tsai Chin appeared in two James Bond films, 39 years apart: as a Bond girl in You Only Live Twice; and in Casino Royale. She also appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode \"The Only Light in the Darkness\" (2014) as Lian May and in the feature film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) as Waipo. Her single, \"The Ding Dong Song,\" recorded for Decca, hit the top of the music charts in Asia. She was the first acting instructor to be invited to teach acting in China after the Cultural Revolution, when China's universities re-opened. In China, she is best known for her portrayal of Grandmother Jia in the 2010 TV drama series The Dream of Red Mansions." ;

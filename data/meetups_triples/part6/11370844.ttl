        mtp:hasAbstract        "Arthur Dong is an American filmmaker and author whose work centers on Asia America and anti-gay prejudice. He was raised in San Francisco, California, graduating from Galileo High School in June 1971. He received his BA in film from San Francisco State University and also holds a Directing Fellow Certificate from the American Film Institute Center for Advanced Film Studies. In 2007, SFSU named Dong its Alumnus of the year â€œfor his continued success in the challenging arena of independent documentary filmmaking and his longstanding commitment to social justice.\" Dong is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences where he served on the Board of Governors from 2002 to 2006 (Documentary Branch). He is also a member of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, and has served on the boards of Film Independent (formerly IFP/West), the National Film Preservation Board at the Library of Congress, and Outfest. At the Academy, he was among the original architects that advocated for and founded the Academy's Documentary Branch in 2001; he was also a decade-long member of the organization's Documentary Executive Committee that helped to shape the new branch. During his tenure at the National Film Preservation Board, he successfully nominated and lobbied for the selection of two seminal Chinese American films into the National Film Registry: Flower Drum Song (1961) and The Curse of Quon Gwon (1916), the earliest known film produced and directed by an Asian American that Mr. Dong helped re-discover while researching for his Hollywood Chinese documentary." ;

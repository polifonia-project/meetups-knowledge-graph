        mtp:hasAbstract        "Graham Lindsey (born May 20, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin. He played in several punk bands, including Old Skull, while still in high-school. He released his first solo album in 2003. While retaining the punk attitude and political awareness Lindsey's music had since evolved and exposed his folk and country roots, to create a mix of folk, alternative country, Americana & country noir. He has since released two more albums, one EP and contributed to several compilations. Four of Lindsey's songs were used in the direct-to-DVD film Fairview St., released in 2010. His song \"Emma Rumble\" was used in the direct-to-DVD film Dunsmore, released in 2004. Lindsey lives in Montana and performs with his wife Tina Lindsey." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Khemchand Prakash (12 December 1907 â€“ 10 August 1949) was a music composer in the Hindi film industry. He had few peers in 1940s, the decade for Indian film music which started with Saigal very active on the scene and ended with Lata Mangeshkar firmly established in the industry. Lata had fruitful association with him (in films Asha, Ziddi, Mahal) when she started making a name for herself. Many years after Khemchand Prakash's death, the ace composer Kamal Dasgupta rated him the best composer. Khemchand's brother, Basant Prakash, was also a film composer. Khemchand Prakash had only 1 daughter & her name was Savitri." ;

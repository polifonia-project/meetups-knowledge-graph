        mtp:hasAbstract        "Colonel Sir Aretas William Young (31 March 1777 â€“ 1 December 1835) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator of the early nineteenth century. After extensive military service in the Peninsular War and elsewhere, Young held a range of colonial government roles in the West Indies and Prince Edward Island, of which he was Lieutenant Governor. Young was knighted in 1834 for his colonial service. While in office at Charlottetown, he died, and was replaced by General John Harvey. Sir Aretas is a direct ancestor of the musician Will Young." ;

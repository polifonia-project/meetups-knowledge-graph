Since being signed to a record deal in 1998 after competing in a singing competition, Hsiao has gone on to release fourteen studio albums and has achieved great commercial success within the Chinese pop music industry. Known for her R&B influenced ballads, the artist's first album, Elva First Album (1999), was considered one of the first to incorporate R&B in the Chinese market. Her most recent album Naked Truth was released in 2020. Hsiao was recognized as one of four of the most popular female singers in the Chinese music scene among her contemporaries. As a result, she has also been brand ambassadors to various brand names such as, Motorola, Sprite, De Beers, Avon, Pantene and Ford. Hsiao was named one of Taiwan's top earning singers in 2014, with more than US$18 million earned." ;

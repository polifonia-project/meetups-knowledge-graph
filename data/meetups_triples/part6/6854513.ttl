        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clive Langer (born 19 June 1954 in Hampstead, London, England) is an English record producer and songwriter, active from the mid-1970s onwards. He usually works with Alan Winstanley. He composed the music for the films Still Crazy and Brothers of the Head. Prior to his record producing career he was a guitarist with the British cult band Deaf School. Langer sometimes performed under the alias of 'Cliff Hanger', and his production work was sometimes attributed to 'Clanger'. After Deaf School, in mid 1977, Langer joined Big in Japan which he suggested to his friend Bill Drummond (later founder of Zoo Records and member of The KLF) to form, but Langer quit shortly afterwards and began a new band, Clive Langer and the Boxes. Their releases were I Want the Whole World, a 12\" EP released in 1979 on Radar Records. and Splash!, an album released in 1980 on F-Beat Records. Langer co-wrote the song \"Shipbuilding\" with Elvis Costello, and played organ on the version by Robert Wyatt which was a Top 40 hit in the UK." ;

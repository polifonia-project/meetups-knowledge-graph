        mtp:hasAbstract        "Darryl Cherney (born 1956) is an American musician and environmental activist. He is a member of the Earth First! environmental movement. Born and raised in New York City, he lives in Humboldt County, California. Cherney has produced five albums of his own political satire, and founded Environmentally Sound Promotions and Churn It Up Records. Together with Greg King, in 1986 he co-founded the movement to save what eventually became the federally protected Headwaters Forest Reserve near Eureka, California. He organized four rallies in support of Julia Butterfly Hill's two-year tree sit. He organized the Redwood Summer campaign with Judi Bari. One of Cherney's songs, \"Where Are We Gonna Work (When the Trees Are Gone?)\", has been covered by Jello Biafra and Mojo Nixon on their album Prairie Home Invasion." ;

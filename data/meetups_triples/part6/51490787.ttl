        mtp:hasAbstract        "Matthew \"Matthue\" Roth (born June 30, 1978) is an American columnist, author, poet, spoken word performer, video game designer, and screenwriter. Beginning his career as a slam poet in San Francisco, Roth gained attention for his unusual blend of religious themes with frank sexual material, and appeared in the 2002 live Broadway production of Def Poetry Jam. As a writer, he has written three young adult novels, two children's books, and two memoirs, and has written for The Forward, Tablet, and Jewcy. He also co-founded the Jewish culture website Hevria, with Elad Nehorai, and the Jewish educational website G-dcast (later BimBam), with Sarah Lefton. In 2014, Roth and his then-wife, restaurateur Itta Werdiger-Roth, were included in The Jewish Week's \"36 Under 36\", a list of influential young Jews under age 36." ;

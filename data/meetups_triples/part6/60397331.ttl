He is known for dealing socially conscious themes, as well as his uniquely vivid style of storytelling through the medium of rap.

Rapman experienced international fame with his three-part YouTube trilogy Shiro's Story (2018), which gained a cult following among the music scene in the United Kingdom and led to his signing with Jay-Z's Roc Nation. Rapman made his writing and directorial debut with Blue Story (2019), an adaptation of his YouTube series of the same name. His other film and TV credits include American Son, the remake of the 2009 French crime film A Prophet, and the Netflix superhero series Supacell.

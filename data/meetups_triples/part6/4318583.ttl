        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Michael Andrews (born 6 July 1972) is an Australian politician serving as the 48th and current premier of Victoria since December 2014. He has been the leader of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) since December 2010 and a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the division of Mulgrave since 2002. Andrews initially worked as a research and political officer for the Labor Party, before being elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly at the 2002 election for the seat of Mulgrave. In 2006 he was appointed to the Ministry by Premier Steve Bracks, serving as the Minister for Consumer Affairs, before being promoted by Premier John Brumby in 2007 to Minister for Health. After the defeat of Brumby at the 2010 election by Ted Baillieu, Andrews was elected as the Leader of the Labor Party in Victoria, becoming Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly. In November 2014, after serving only one term in opposition, Andrews led Labor to victory at the 2014 election; he was sworn in as Premier of Victoria by Governor Alex Chernov on 4 December. He led Labor to a landslide second victory at the 2018 election, increasing the parties majority by 10 seats in the Legislative Assembly, and to a third landslide victory at the 2022 election maintaining the parties majority. Major challenges to the premiership of Andrews have included the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season and the COVID-19 pandemic. Andrews is a member of the “socialist” Labor Left faction of the Labor Party. He is a proponent of Australian republicanism and has expressed support for unionism and organised labour." ;

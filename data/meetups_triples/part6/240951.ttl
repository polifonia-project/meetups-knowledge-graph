These apparitions occurred between 11 February and 16 July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified herself as the \"Immaculate Conception.\" After a canonical investigation, Soubirous's reports were eventually declared \"worthy of belief\" on 18 February 1862, and the Marian apparition became known as Our Lady of Lourdes. Soubirous’s body has remained internally incorrupt.The Marian shrine at Lourdes (Midi-Pyrénées, from 2016 part of Occitanie) went on to become a major pilgrimage site, attracting over five million pilgrims of all denominations each year. On 8 December 1933, Pope Pius XI, declared Soubirous a saint of the Catholic Church. Her feast day, initially specified as 18 February – the day Mary promised to make her happy, not in this life, but in the other – is now observed in most places on the date of her death, 16 April." ;

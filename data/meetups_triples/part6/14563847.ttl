        mtp:hasAbstract        "Domenic Desio Mariani (born 27 July 1958) is an Australian guitarist, vocalist, producer, and songwriter. Mariani has been a member of several bands since the early 1980s, including The Stems, The Someloves, DM3, Datura, The Majestic Kelp and the Domnicks. The Stems is the best-known and most successful of Mariani's projects. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described the power pop group as \"one of the best live bands on the Australian scene\". In 2005 Mariani was inducted into the West Australian Music Industry Awards Hall of Fame. In August of that year he curated a double-CD compilation album, Popsided Guitar: Anthology 1984â€“2004, which included material from several of his bands. In 2007 United States writer John M. Borack rated Mariani as \"one of the top five pop titans of the past couple of decades\". Outside his music career, Mariani's main occupation is as an architectural designer. His son John Mariani and nephew Dion Mariani were mainstays of a pre-teenagegarage rock band called The Flairz from 2003 to 2009." ;

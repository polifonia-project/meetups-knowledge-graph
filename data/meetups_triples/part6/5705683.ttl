        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrew Ellison (born 5 July 1945 in Finchley, London, England) is an English musician and vocalist, best known as the frontman in John's Children, Jet and Radio Stars. He attended Box Hill School in Surrey, where he met Chris Townson. John's Children also featured Marc Bolan and Chris Townson. A song sung by Ellison, \"It's Been A Long Time\", appears on the soundtrack to the film, Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush. \"It's Been A Long Time\" also featured on the compilation album, Backtrack 1, a Track Records release featuring The Who and Jimi Hendrix amongst others. Jet released an album on CBS Records in 1975, toured as support to Hunter-Ronson and then became Radio Stars, who had one UK Top 40 hit, \"Nervous Wreck\" in early 1978. It peaked at No. 39. The B-side to the single was a cover of Marc Bolan's \"Horrible Breath\", a John's Children staple." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kierra Valencia \"Kiki\" Sheard-Kelly (born June 20, 1987) is an American gospel singer, songwriter, fashion designer, actress, entrepreneur, author, and creative director. She is the daughter of gospel singer Karen Clark-Sheard (member of gospel singing group the Clark Sisters) and granddaughter of gospel choral director Mattie Moss Clark. Sheard portrayed her mother in the hit Lifetime movie, The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel. After appearing on her mother's (most notably, the seminal Finally Karen) and aunt's albums, Sheard broke to the music scene with the release of her debut album I Owe You in 2004. Her hit single \"You Don't Know\" was inspired by her mother almost losing her life to a fatal blood clot." ;

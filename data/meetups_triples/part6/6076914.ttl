He began his musical training in Buffalo, New York at the age of eight, after which he continued his studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music. In 1992, Vieaux was awarded the Guitar Foundation of America International Guitar Competition First Prize, the event's youngest winner. NPR describes him as, \"perhaps the most precise and soulful classical guitarist of his generation,\" and Gramophone magazine puts him \"among the elite of today's classical guitarists.\" His album Play won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Classical Instrumental Solo." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Manuel Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca (April 21, 1915 â€“ June 3, 2001), known professionally as Anthony Quinn, was a Mexican-American actor. He was known for his portrayal of earthy, passionate characters \"marked by a brutal and elemental virility\" in numerous critically acclaimed films both in Hollywood and abroad. His notable films include La Strada, The Guns of Navarone, Guns for San Sebastian, Lawrence of Arabia, The Shoes of the Fisherman, The Message, Lion of the Desert, and Jungle Fever. He also had an Oscar-nominated titular role in Zorba the Greek. Quinn won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor twice: for Viva Zapata! in 1952 and Lust for Life in 1956. In addition, he received two Academy Award nominations in the Best Leading Actor category, along with five Golden Globe nominations and two BAFTA Award nominations. In 1987, he was presented with the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. Through both his artistic endeavours and civil rights activism, he remains a seminal figure of Latin-American representation in the media of the United States." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gerald Thomas Smith (July 19, 1943 â€“ October 15, 1986) was a professional American football tight end for the National Football League's Washington Redskins for 13 seasons, from 1965 through 1977. By the time he retired, he held the NFL record for most career touchdowns by a tight end. Smith publicly announced he had AIDS in August 1986, being the first professional athlete to do so. He died two months later. A 2014 documentary from the NFL Network's A Football Life series profiles his career, as well as his \"double life as a closeted gay man and a star athlete.\"" ;

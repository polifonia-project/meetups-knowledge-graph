        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hannah Cullwick (26 May 1833 â€“ 9 July 1909) was a diarist who revealed less-known aspects of the relations between Victorian servants and their masters. Working in domestic service, she caught the attention of Arthur Munby, a prominent barrister and philanthropist, who was making a close study of the conditions of working women. She married him reluctantly in Jan 1873 In Clerkenwell Parish Church by Special License granted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, but it was a most unconventional partnership, with a continuation of secret role-playing, as documented in both their diaries, which have survived, along with letters and photographs." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Petros Peloponnesios (\"Peter the Peloponnesian\") or Peter the Lampadarios (c. 1735 Tripolisâ€“1778 Constantinople) was a great cantor, composer and teacher of Byzantine and Ottoman music. He must have served as second domestikos between his arrival about 1764 until the death of Ioannes Trapezountios, and it is assumed that he became lampadarios (leader of the left choir) between 1770 and 1778 at the Great Church of Constantinople, after Daniel the Protopsaltes became Archon Protopsaltes. Large parts of the monodic chant sung in several current traditions of Orthodox Chant are transcriptions of his compositions, which he had written down as a teacher of the \"New Music School of the Patriarchate\"." ;

The name Heize was inspired by the name of an American rapper Angel Haze, but instead of using the same English spelling, she decided to use Heize instead of Haze, because that was the spelling that came to mind. After making her debut in 2014 with the EP Heize, she gained attention after appearing on the second season of South Korean reality show Unpretty Rapstar. Shortly after, her breakout hit “Star” reached the top of the music charts." ;

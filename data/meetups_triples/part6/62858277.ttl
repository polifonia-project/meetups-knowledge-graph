        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charlton Kenneth Jeffrey Howard (born 17 August 2003), known professionally as the Kid Laroi (stylised as The Kid LAROI), is an Australian rapper, singer and songwriter. He originally gained recognition from his association and friendship with American rapper Juice Wrld while he was on tour in Australia. He gained a local following before joining a partnership agreement with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Columbia Records, and attained further popularity in 2020 with his collaboration with Juice Wrld on \"Go\", which peaked at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut mixtape, F*ck Love (2020), peaked at number one on the Australian ARIA Charts, making him the youngest Australian solo artist ever to reach the top of the chart, and also reached number one on the US Billboard 200. Additionally, Howard's songs \"Without You\" and its remix with Miley Cyrus, and his collaboration with Justin Bieber, \"Stay\", reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Stay\" peaking at number one for seven non-consecutive weeks." ;

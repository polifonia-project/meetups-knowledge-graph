        mtp:hasAbstract        "Deron Roger Johnson (July 17, 1938 – April 23, 1992) was an American professional baseball infielder, outfielder, designated hitter, and coach, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Kansas City/Oakland Athletics, Cincinnati Reds, Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox, and Chicago White Sox, over the course of his 16-year big league playing career. While an active player, Johnson stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall, weighing 200 pounds (91 kg). He batted and threw right-handed. Johnson later served as an MLB hitting coach for 12 seasons with the California Angels (1979–1980; 1989–1992), New York Mets (1981), Phillies (1982–1984), Seattle Mariners (1985–1986), and White Sox (1987). He was still an active member of the California coaching staff when diagnosed with lung cancer, which claimed his life on April 23, 1992, at the age of 53." ;

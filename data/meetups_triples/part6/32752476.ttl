        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tom Andrew Nichols (born 28 August 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for League Two club Crawley Town. Having come through Exeter City's academy, Nichols made his first-team debut for the club in May 2011. Whilst at Exeter City, he had loan spells at Dorchester Town, Hereford United and Bath City before establishing himself as a first team player in League Two. He joined Peterborough United of League One on a four-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 1 February 2016, but joined Bristol Rovers on a three-year contract in summer 2017. Following a loan spell at Cheltenham Town in the second half of the 2019â€“20 season, he was released by Bristol Rovers at the end of his three-year contract in summer 2020, and subsequently signed for League Two side Crawley Town on a one-year contract." ;

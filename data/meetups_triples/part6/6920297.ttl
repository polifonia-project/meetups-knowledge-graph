        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Henry Sims RA RWS (28 January 1873, Islingtonâ€“13 April 1928, St. Boswells) was a British figurative painter known for his portraits and landscapes. He initially became renowned as a leading Edwardian painter, but following the death of his son in World War I, his work became increasingly idiosyncratic, surreal and controversial. In 1920, he was appointed Keeper, or head, of the Royal Academy Schools, a post he was eventually forced to resign in 1926. At the same time, he became estranged from his wife and children. Sims' final paintings, the Spiritual Ideas, were to some viewers his \"most beautiful works,\" but to others highly disturbing. He died by suicide in 1928." ;

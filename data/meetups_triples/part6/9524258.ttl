        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edmund Gerard \"Ted\" Carroll (19 February 1939 â€“ 22 December 1995) was an Irish hurler who played as a centre-back for the Kilkenny senior team. Born in Lisdowney, County Kilkenny, Carroll first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Kieran's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1971 championship. Carroll subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won three All-Ireland medals, five Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions Carroll won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he won one championship medal with University College Dublin while he also enjoyed a lengthy career with Lisdowney. His brother-in-law, Jimmy O'Brien, was a two-time All-Ireland medallist with Wexford. Throughout his career Carroll made 22 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1971 championship. In retirement from playing Carroll became involved in the administrative affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. He served as secretary of the Kilkenny County Board between 1984 and 1995. In 1969, Carrol was selected as the Texaco Hurler of the Year. He has sometimes been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at centre-back on the Fitzgibbon Cup Hurling Team of the Century in 2012." ;

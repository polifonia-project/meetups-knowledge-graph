The author of sixteen books, both fiction and non-fiction, she has been the \"Dear Carol\" advice columnist at Girls' Life since the magazine's first issue in 1994. Her newest book is Speed of Life, which received starred reviews in Kirkus, Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, and Booklist. The New York Times Book Review called it \"perceptive, funny and moving.\" About Ava and Pip (Sourcebooks Jabberwocky 2014), The New York Times Book Review said, \"This is a book about sisterhood, but also a love letter to language.\" Also in this series: Ava and Taco Cat (2015) and AVA XOX (2016)." ;

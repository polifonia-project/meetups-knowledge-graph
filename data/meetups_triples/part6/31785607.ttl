        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Bennett (born May 16, 1985) is an American professional wrestler best known under the ring name Mike Bennett. He currently competes for the National Wrestling Alliance. He is best known for his time in Ring of Honor (ROH), where he is a former ROH World Tag Team Champion, and also competed in the WWE under the ring name Mike Kanellis and Impact Wrestling where he was a member of Honor No More After a few years on the independent circuit, Bennett made his Ring of Honor (ROH) debut in 2008; his character was named The Prodigy. With his then-girlfriend Maria Kanellis, he worked as part of \"The Kingdom\" stable, winning the ROH World Tag Team Championship with Matt Taven. ROH's talent-sharing agreement with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) enabled the tag team to make limited appearances in Japan, where they won NJPW's IWGP Tag Team Championship. Bennett and Taven also operate a wrestling school in West Warwick, Rhode Island. Bennett left ROH in late-2015 to sign with rival promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he won the TNA X Division Championship. In 2017, Bennett joined his wife Maria in WWE (whose maiden name was used as his character's surname), where held the WWE 24/7 Championship twice." ;

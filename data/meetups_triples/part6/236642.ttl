        mtp:hasAbstract        "Erik Axel Karlfeldt (20 July 1864 – 8 April 1931) was a Swedish poet whose highly symbolist poetry masquerading as regionalism was popular and won him the 1931 Nobel Prize in Literature posthumously after he had been nominated by Nathan Söderblom, member of the Swedish Academy. It has been rumored that he had been offered the award already in 1919 but refused it, at least in part because of his position as permanent secretary to the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize." ;

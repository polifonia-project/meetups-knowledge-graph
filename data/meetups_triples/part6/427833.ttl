Open about his homosexuality and adult film work throughout his career, Wrangler was considered an icon of the gay-liberation movement. In 2008, a feature-length documentary film, Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon, was released documenting his careers both off and on the stage. Wrangler's wife for the last 15 years of his life, was U.S. singer Margaret Whiting." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Henry Holdcroft (23 January 1909 – 17 April 1983), also known as Harry Holdcroft, was an England international football goalkeeper. He played for Port Vale, Darlington, Everton, Accrington Stanley, Barnsley, Burnley, Bury, Oldham Athletic, Manchester United, Southport, Leyland Motors, Morecambe and Chorley. However it was for his seven years at Preston North End, from 1932 to 1939, that he became well known. He helped the club to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1933–34, and kept goal as Preston lifted the FA Cup in 1938. He also represented England twice in 1936." ;

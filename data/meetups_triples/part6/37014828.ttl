        mtp:hasAbstract        "Domenico Berardi Cavaliere OMRI (Italian pronunciation: [doˈmeːniko beˈrardi]; born 1 August 1994) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Sassuolo and the Italy national team. Berardi began his club career with Sassuolo in 2012, helping the team win the Serie B title and earn promotion to Serie A in his debut season, later also being named the best player of the competition. His prolific performances in Serie A saw him emerge as one of Italy's most promising young footballers, and earned him the Bravo Award in 2015. He is currently Sassuolo's all-time record goal-scorer with over 100 goals in all competitions. He made his senior international debut with Italy in 2018, and was later a member of the squad that won UEFA Euro 2020." ;

Andrew \"Shay\" Hopkins, a native of Crockett, Texas attended Ralph Bunche High School. He was a member of the High School Choir, Ralph Bunche Gazette, Year-book Staff and sports editor of the Ralph Bunche Year-book. Andy showed extraordinary athletic abilities in high school. He was a stand-out star in track, baseball, and football. Hopkins didn't make the football team: he was cut as a ninth-grader under the coaching of his father, Andrew J. Hopkins. Hopkins used this incident as a determining factor to try harder. He later became captain of his high school football team." ;

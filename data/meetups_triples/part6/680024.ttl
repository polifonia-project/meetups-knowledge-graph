        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Lee Kirk (December 10, 1941 â€“ September 28, 2021) was an American actor, best known for his performances in films made by Walt Disney Studios such as Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Swiss Family Robinson, The Absent-Minded Professor, and The Misadventures of Merlin Jones, as well as the beach-party films of the mid-1960s. He frequently appeared as a love interest for Annette Funicello or as part of a family with Kevin Corcoran as his younger brother and Fred MacMurray as his father. Kirk's career with Disney ended when news of his homosexuality threatened to become public. He struggled with drugs and depression for several years, appearing in a series of low-budget films before leaving the acting business in the mid-1970s. Thereafter, Kirk opened a carpet cleaning business and lived a mostly ordinary life, occasionally appearing at fan conventions. Kirk died at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2021." ;

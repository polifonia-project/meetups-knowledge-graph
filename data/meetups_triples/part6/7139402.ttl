He formed the heavy rock band Dark Lord in 1984 and recorded two EPs with them. In the early 1980s Masi moved briefly to London, where he played with several musicians in the NWOBHM scene. With Dark Lord he toured as opening act for several major acts of the period until 1986, when he was invited by Metal Blade Records to move to Los Angeles and join the band Sound Barrier. He later founded a band of his own, called Masi. First album under the name MASI was called \"Fire in the Rain\" and it featured the single \"Fire in the Rain\". The second, more successful album under the name MASI was titled \"Downtown Dreamers\" it featured the hit single \"God Promised a Paradise\" which was on Heavy Rotation on MTV for a couple of months and is still on rotation on VH1 Classics.

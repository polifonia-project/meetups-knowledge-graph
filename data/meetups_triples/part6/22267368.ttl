A premiership player at Old Xaverians in 1981, Curtain could only manage two appearances with St Kilda's seniors. He returned to Old Xavs after his VFL stint ended and won their 'Best and Fairest' in 1986, his first year as captain. Curtain remained captain until the end of the 1988 season and in the same year represented the Australian Amateurs team at the Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival." ;

Calling himself the \"Father of Combat TV,\" he was a fixture on Southern California television for three decades (1950s–1980s) as the host of Hot Seat, which began as a local show on KDOC Channel 56, a local Southern California based UHF TV station in Anaheim, Orange County in 1983. His other nicknames were \"Mr. Conservative\" and \"Mr. America\" in the 1960s–1990s and he represented the strong conservative fan base of Orange County and the Coachella Valley of California where he was also on their local TV stations." ;

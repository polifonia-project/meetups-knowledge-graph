He was Commander-in-Chief of the German Army from February 1934 until February 1938, when he was forced to resign after he was falsely accused of being homosexual. His ousting was a major step in Adolf Hitler's establishment of tighter control over the armed forces. Just over a year later, before the outbreak of World War II, Fritsch was recalled as Colonel-in-chief of the 12th Artillery Regiment. He died in battle in Poland early in the war." ;

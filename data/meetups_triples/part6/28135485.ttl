        mtp:hasAbstract        "The Usos (born August 22, 1985) are an American professional wrestling tag team composed of twin brothers Joshua Samuel Fatu and Jonathan Solofa Fatu, who are known professionally by their respective ring names Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso. They are both currently signed to WWE, where they perform on the SmackDown brand and are the current Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions, holding both the Raw Tag Team Championship in their third reign and the SmackDown Tag Team Championship in their fifth reign, which is the longest reign for the latter at 506+ days and the longest male tag team title reign in WWE history. They are also part of a stable called The Bloodline. Trained since childhood by their father, WWE Hall of Famer Rikishi, the team debuted in WWE's developmental brand Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in 2009, where they became FCW Florida Tag Team Champions. Widely regarded as one of the greatest tag teams in WWE history, they were moved to the main roster the following year, and have gone on to be overall eight-time tag team champions in WWE, capturing the WWE (Raw) Tag Team Championship three times and winning the Slammy Award for Tag Team of the Year in both 2014 and 2015. In 2017, they won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship on three occasions, followed by a fourth reign in 2019 and a fifth reign in 2021. They are the first team to win both the Raw and SmackDown Tag Team Championships and the only team to hold them simultaneously. The Usos are members of the renowned Anoa ªi family of Samoan wrestlers, which also includes their father Rikishi, uncle Umaga, their father's cousins the late WWE Hall of Famer Yokozuna, Roman Reigns, and through a blood brotherhood between their great-grandfather Reverend Amituana'i Anoa'i and Peter Maivia, The Rock. The pair were previously managed by their cousin Tamina Snuka and Jimmy's wife, Naomi." ;

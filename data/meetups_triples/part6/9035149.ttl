        mtp:hasAbstract        "Laura Jones (born 1951) is an Australian screenwriter. Jones started her career writing teleplays for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Her first feature film credit was the original screenplay for High Tide (1987), directed by Gillian Armstrong and starring Judy Davis. This was followed by her adaptation of the Janet Frame autobiography, An Angel at My Table (1990), which was directed by Jane Campion. She collaborated again with Campion, this time on The Portrait of a Lady (1996). The following years saw her team up with Armstrong on Oscar and Lucinda, as well as work on other literary adaptations for Hollywood. Jones is a strong supporter of Australian filmmaking and during the 1990s served on the Australian Film Commission. She is the daughter of Australian author Jessica Anderson." ;

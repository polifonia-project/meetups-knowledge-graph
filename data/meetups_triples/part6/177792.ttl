A major stage actress of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, she is remembered for the dozens of films she appeared in during the 1930s, when she was in her 70s. Robson was the earliest-born woman, and the first Australian to be nominated for an Academy Award (for her leading role in Lady for a Day in 1933)." ;

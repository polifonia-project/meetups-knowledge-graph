        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martin Joseph Léonard Bresso (French pronunciation: ​[maʁtɛ̃ ʒɔzɛf leɔnaʁ bʁeso]; born 12 May 1985), better known by his stage name Tchami (IPA: [tʃami]), is a French record producer and DJ from Paris. A founding member of the Pardon My French collective, he is best known for his solo work and regarded as a pioneer of the future house genre alongside Dutch DJs Oliver Heldens and Don Diablo. When asked about the origins of his name Tchami, the French artist explained, \"I used to travel a lot across Europe and Africa these past five years. Tchami is a name that has been given to me in Africa which is an honor. Fortunately it sounded catchy to me, so I kept it. That's all folks.\" Tchami often performs with the persona of a priest and a church theme. He wears a clerical collar and includes visuals such as an altar and stained glass windows. In an interview he explained that \"it is my message, being spiritual. I think my music is about that too.\"." ;

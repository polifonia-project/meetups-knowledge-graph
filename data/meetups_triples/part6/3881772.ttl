        mtp:hasAbstract        "David E. Zuckerman (born August 16, 1971) is an American politician, who is the lieutenant governor-elect of Vermont. He previously served two terms as the 82nd lieutenant governor of Vermont, from 2017 to 2021. A member of the Vermont Progressive Party, he previously served in the Vermont House of Representatives for seven terms (1997–2011), and the Vermont Senate for two (2013–2017). In 2020, Zuckerman was a candidate for governor of Vermont. He ran with the support of both the Progressive Party and the Democratic Party, but lost to incumbent Governor Phil Scott in the general election. In 2016, Zuckerman ran for lieutenant governor as a Progressive, and also received the nomination of the Democratic Party by defeating Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives Shap Smith and Representative Kesha Ram in the Democratic primary. He defeated Republican State Senator Randy Brock in the 2016 general election. Zuckerman was re-elected in 2018. Zuckerman was the first Progressive Party candidate to win statewide office in Vermont. Other Progressive-endorsed candidates who have won statewide-office elections, including Doug Hoffer for Vermont state auditor, were primarily affiliated with the Vermont Democratic Party. Zuckerman's elections to statewide office have reinforced Vermont as a state with the presence of a major party other than the Democratic and Republican parties." ;

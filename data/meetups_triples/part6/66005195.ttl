Caldwell was an unusually staunch segregationist even for the era in the Deep South. In 1943, Caldwell chose to turn down $67,000 in federal funds for a new medical center because it would have required hiring 12 blacks out of every 100 workers. (Shreveport was 37% African American in the 1940 census.) \"We are not going to be bribed by federal funds,\" Caldwell explained, \"to accept the negro as our political or social equal\"; federal offficials would not \"cram the negro down our throats.\"" ;

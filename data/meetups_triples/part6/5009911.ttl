        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yvette Barbra Hontiveros Almalbis-Honasan (born August 26, 1977), better known as Barbie Almalbis, is a Filipino singer-songwriter. Formerly the lead singer of the bands Hungry Young Poets and Barbie's Cradle, she pursued a solo career in 2005, releasing her self-titled compilation album, Barbie: The Singles. In 2006, she released her debut solo album, Parade. Her music is characterised by a rather quirky, but endearing vocal style, and guitar work. Almabis is a capable guitarist in her own right and a painter; she is a born-again Christian and is married to Martin Honasan (the son of Sen. Gringo Honasan), a painter and scion of a Philippine political family. The couple named their firstborn Noa Stina. Her sister-in-law is Kai Honasan who does keyboards and vocals on the band Autotelic. She is also cousins with Pia and Risa Hontiveros. In 2016, she was chosen to interpret Nica del Rosario's composition \"Ambon\" at the 2016 edition of Himig Handog: P-Pop Love Songs." ;

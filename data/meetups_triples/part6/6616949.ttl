        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mauro Bigonzetti (born 1960) is an Italian ballet dancer and choreographer. He trained at the ballet school of Teatro dell'Opera di Roma and entered their company in 1979. In 1983 Bigonzetti joined the Reggio Emilia company Aterballetto, renowned for its contemporary repertory. He first began to choreograph for Aterballetto in 1990. In 1993 he joined as resident choreographer and in 1997 returned to Aterballetto as artistic director. Throughout his choreographic career Bigonzetti has maintained a close relationship with Aterballetto. He continues there as principal choreographer, although his career now centers on commissions written for major companies abroad. He served as director of La Scala Ballet in 2016 but resigned for health reasons after eight months." ;

He was of Afro-Portuguese heritage and was born in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood of Montreal. Born with the surname \"Rodrigues,\" he adopted the spelling \"Rodriguez\" after it was misspelled in a Broadway program early in his career. Rodriguez was also known for his extensive voiceover work as the narrator of film trailers, television spots and documentaries." ;

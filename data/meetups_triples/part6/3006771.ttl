W. Swanton. He worked as a sports journalist for The Daily Telegraph and as a broadcaster for BBC Radio for 30 years. He was a regular commentator on Test Match Special, easily recognised by his distinctive \"fruity\" voice. After \"retiring\" in the 1970s, he continued to write occasional articles and columns until his death in 2000." ;

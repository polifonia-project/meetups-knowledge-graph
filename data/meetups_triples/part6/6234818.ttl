He is frequently associated with Le Splendid, which he co-founded, along with Thierry Lhermitte, Josiane Balasko, Christian Clavier, Marie-Anne Chazel and GÃ©rard Jugnot.Michel Blanc has also shown his versatility by appearing in more serious roles, such as the title role in the Patrice Leconte film Monsieur Hire. He is one of the few people to have won awards at the Cannes Film Festival in both a creative and performing role, winning the Male Acting Prize in 1986 and the Best Screenplay Prize in 1994." ;

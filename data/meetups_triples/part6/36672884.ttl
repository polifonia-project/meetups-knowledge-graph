During years of occupation (or World War II), he studied the violin; after the war, he began learning to play the piano and organ. From 1946-1950, he played the organ for several Vilnius churches. From 1952 to 1957, he studied music composition in the conservatory of Vilnius. Afterwards, he moves to Warsaw and continues his studies at the Warsaw Academy of Music from 1957 to 1960, studying under Bolesław Woytowicz. In 1963 and 1966 he studied Gregorian chant and medieval polyphony in Nadia Boulanger's class in Paris. Since 1971 Twardowski has been a professor at the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music. The 1960s and 1970s were the most fruitful period for the composer. Apart from operas: \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1962)\"Tragedy or the Story of John and Herod\"(1965)\"Lord Jim\" (1973) Composed ballets: \"Naked Prince\" (1960)\"Wizard's Sculptures\"(1963) In the 1980s, he composed operas Maria Stuart and History of St. Catherine which were also performed abroad.

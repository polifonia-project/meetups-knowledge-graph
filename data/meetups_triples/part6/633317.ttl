        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian Michael Bendis (/ˈbɛndɪs/; born August 18, 1967) is an American comic book writer and artist. He has won five Eisner Awards for both his creator-owned work and his work on various Marvel Comics books. Starting with crime and noir comics, Bendis eventually moved to mainstream superhero work. With Bill Jemas and Mark Millar, Bendis was the writer on the first book of the Ultimate Marvel Universe, launching Ultimate Spider-Man in 2000. He relaunched the Avengers franchise with New Avengers in 2004, and also wrote the Marvel storylines \"Secret War\" (2004–2005), \"House of M\" (2005), \"Secret Invasion\" (2008), \"Siege\" (2010) and \"Age of Ultron\" (2013). Though Bendis has cited comic book writers such as Frank Miller and Alan Moore, his own writing influences are less rooted in comics, drawing on the work of David Mamet, Richard Price, and Aaron Sorkin, whose dialogue, Bendis said, was \"the best in any medium.\" In addition to writing comics, Bendis has worked in television, video games and film. He has also taught courses on graphic novels at University of Oregon and Portland State University. In 2014, Bendis wrote Words for Pictures: The Art and Business of Writing Comics and Graphic Novels, a book about comics published by Random House." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jacques Dominique Wilkins (born January 12, 1960) is an American former professional basketball player who primarily played for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Wilkins was a nine-time NBA All-Star and is widely viewed as one of the most acrobatic slam dunkers in NBA history, earning the nickname \"the Human Highlight Film\". In 2006, Wilkins was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In October 2021, he was honored as one of the leagueâ€™s greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. In addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the Los Angeles Clippers, the Boston Celtics, Panathinaikos Athens (a professional team in Greece's top-tier level Greek Basket League, with whom he won his first titles, the FIBA European League and the Greek Cup), Fortitudo Bologna (a professional team in Italy's top-tier level LBA), the San Antonio Spurs, and the Orlando Magic before he retired in 1999." ;

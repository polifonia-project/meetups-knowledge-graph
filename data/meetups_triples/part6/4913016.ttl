        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carlos Edwin Colón Jr. (born February 21, 1979) is a Puerto Rican professional wrestler. He is best known for his time with WWE, under the ring name Carlito. He is currently making appearances for multiple promotions, including Qatar Pro Wrestling where he is the current QPW Tag Team Champions with Chris Masters. Colón is a member of the Colón wrestling family, being the son of Carlos Colón. He debuted in his father's promotion, World Wrestling Council (WWC), eventually winning WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship 17 times, and WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship once. During the early years of his career, he made appearances for the X Wrestling Federation and Funking Conservatory, winning his first international championship for the second. In 2003, Colón signed a developmental contract with WWE, and worked for the promotion until 2010. He worked in its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for 16 months, mostly wrestling in tag team matches while making appearances in WWC. In October 2004, he made his main roster debut. He went on to become a one-time United States Champion and one-time Intercontinental Champion, and was part of both the Raw and SmackDown brands. He is the only wrestler to win a championship on two separate debuts in WWE and the second Puerto Rican wrestler (after Pedro Morales) to hold the Intercontinental Championship. At WrestleMania 25, Colón and his brother Primo became the only tag team to unify the WWE Tag Team Championships and World Tag Team Championships. In 2021, Colón made two appearances with WWE, first as an entrant in the Royal Rumble and another the following night on Raw." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kevin John Wright (born 27 December 1953) is an Australian former Test cricketer. Wright played as a wicket-keeper, making 10 Test and five One Day International appearances for Australia in 1979 during the World Series Cricket era. He replaced John Maclean after the Fourth Test in the 1978–79 Ashes series, and played the last two Tests of that series, both Tests against Pakistan in Australia shortly afterwards, and all six Tests in India in late 1979, playing all his 10 Tests inside 10 months. After World Series Cricket ended, he lost his place in the Australian and Western Australian teams to Rod Marsh. He moved to South Australia to continue his first-class career. When Wayne Phillips became South Australia's wicket-keeper in 1984, Wright retired from first-class cricket and moved to Sydney, taking up the position of Eagle Insurance's life division manager for New South Wales. In his last match for South Australia he captained them to victory in the McDonald's Cup limited-overs cricket final in 1983–84." ;

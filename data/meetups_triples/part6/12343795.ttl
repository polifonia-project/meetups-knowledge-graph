        mtp:hasAbstract        "Glen Berger is an American playwright and scriptwriter. He has received commissions from the Childrenâ€™s Theater of Minneapolis, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, the Alley Theatre, and the Lookingglass Theater. In 2010, he co-wrote the book for Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, a musical adaptation of Spider-Man, directed by Julie Taymor with music and lyrics by Bono and The Edge of U2. The show had a famously troubled production, and in 2013, Berger wrote an account of his experiences, Song of Spider-Man - The Inside Story of the Most Controversial Musical in Broadway History. Berger has also written scripts for animated children's TV shows, including Arthur, Peep and the Big Wide World, Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman, Big & Small, Octonauts and Curious George. Berger won two Daytime Emmy Awards for Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman and Peep and the Big Wide World, and was nominated twelve times for various series. He is an alumnus of New Dramatists. He is currently working on a trilogy about America, psychedelics, and agriculture." ;

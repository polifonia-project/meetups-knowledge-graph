        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alan John George Morley MBE (born 25 June 1950 in Bristol, England) is a former English rugby union player. He played a record number of 519 times for Bristol, scoring 384 tries, between 1968 and 1986. He won 7 England caps, from 1972 to 1975, scoring 2 tries, 8 points on aggregate. He played at the 1975 Five Nations Championship, scoring a try. He was selected for the 1974 Lions tour but didn't make the Test side, having to compete with J.J. Williams, Billy Steele and Andy Irvine. The highlight of his international career was probably scoring a try on his international d√©but on 3 June 1972, against South Africa when an unfancied England side won 18-9." ;

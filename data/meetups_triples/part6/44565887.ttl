She collaborated with many leading designers, including Jean Patou and Norman Hartnell. She was a key supplier of hats to the royal household from the 1950s on. One of her most notable commissions was the 1960 wedding veil of Princess Margaret; at this event she also made hats for The Queen Mother and the Queen. After closing her own salon, she continued to act as an advisor to other design houses until the mid 1990s." ;

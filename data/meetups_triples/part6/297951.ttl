        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Charles Wentworth (August 1790 â€“ 20 March 1872) was an Australian pastoralist, explorer, newspaper editor, lawyer, politician and author, who became one of the wealthiest and most powerful figures of early colonial New South Wales. Through his newspaper The Australian, and as a founder of the Australian Patriotic Association, Wentworth was among the first colonists to promote a nascent form of Australian nationalism. He was also the leading advocate for a political system of self-government in the Australian colonies that was controlled by affluent land-owning squatters, derided by his critics as the \"bunyip aristocracy\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rania Al-Abdullah (Arabic: رانيا العبد الله, Rāniyā al-ʻAbd Allāh; born Rania Al-Yassin, 31 August 1970) is Queen of Jordan as the wife of King Abdullah II. Rania was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents. She received her bachelor's degree in business at The American University in Cairo. In 1991, following the Gulf War, she and her family fled to Amman, Jordan, where she met Prince Abdullah of Jordan. Before meeting him, she worked at Citibank and then took a job in the marketing department at Apple Inc. Since marrying Abdullah in 1993, she has become known for her advocacy work related to education, health, community empowerment, youth, cross-cultural dialogue and micro-finance. Forbes magazine has ranked Rania as one of the world's 100 most powerful women. The 2022 Credit Suisse leaks claimed that the Queen had an account in a Swiss bank. A statement by the Royal Hashemite Court said the account balance stated in the leak was incorrect and that the account was for the royal couple's children." ;

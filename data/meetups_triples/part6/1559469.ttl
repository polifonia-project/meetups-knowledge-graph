        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian William Luckhurst (5 February 1939 â€“ 1 March 2005) was an English cricketer, who played his entire county career for Kent County Cricket Club. He played for Kent from 1958 to 1976, usually opening the batting, then in 1985, in an emergency, played in one more match against the Australians. He was cricket manager from 1981 to 1986, then became Cricket Administrator. He went on to become President of the Club, and held that position until his death. He played 355 matches for Kent and represented England in 21 Test matches and three one day internationals. Over his entire career Luckhurst totalled 22,303 runs (average 38.12) in first-class cricket. He scored 1,000 runs in a season 14 times, his highest total for a season being 1,194 (average 47.85) in 1969. He scored 48 centuries, with a highest score of 215 against Derbyshire at Derby in 1973. Although primarily a batsman, Luckhurst was technically an all-rounder. He took 64 wickets (average 42.87) with slow left arm spin (although he batted right-handed). On the rare occasions when he was called upon to bowl in a Test match, it was regarded as an indication that the result of the match was a foregone conclusion. He only took one Test wicket." ;

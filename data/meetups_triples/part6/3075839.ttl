        mtp:hasAbstract        "Fuerza Guerrera (born December 13, 1953) is a Mexican Luchador enmascarado (or masked professional wrestler) who made his debut in 1978. In his career Guerrera has worked for every major wrestling organization in Mexico including Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), AAA, Universal Wrestling Association (UWA), World Wrestling Association (WWA) and International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). Throughout his career Fuerza Guerrera has held many titles for CMLL, AAA and IWRG. Fuerza Guerrera's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. Only his paternal surname is known, as his son Eduardo Aníbal González Hernández' name is a matter of public record making Fuerza Guerrera's paternal surname \"González\" as well. Eduardo González is better known as luchador Juventud Guerrera. Fuerza Guerrera is Spanish for \"Warrior Strength\", not to be mistaken for the surname Guerrero." ;

Cochereau was titular organist of the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris from 1955 to his death in 1984 and was responsible for a controversial renovation of the cathedral's organ in the 1960s. He was greatly renowned as an improviser and organist in his lifetime and still is today. After his death, the Conservatory of Nice was renamed in his honour." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Ethan Morrison (also known as John Ethan Wayne; February 22, 1962) is an American actor, known professionally as Ethan Wayne. He is the son of actor John Wayne, and his third wife, Pilar Pallete. He grew up in Newport Beach, California, where he shared his father's love of the ocean and outdoors. His name was chosen in direct relation to John Wayne's character in The Searchers (\"Ethan Edwards\"). He played Little Jake, the grandson of his father's title character in Big Jake. Ethan started doing stunt work after the death of his father in 1979. His first film was The Blues Brothers. He then resumed work as an actor. His next two major film appearances were both in 1981, in the comedy Longshot, and the slasher film Scream. Later works included a role, in the NBC TV movie The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory, as Edward Taylor in 1986, Storm Logan on the CBS soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful (with Robert Mitchum's granddaughter Carrie Mitchum, whom he had met on the Big Jake set), 1987-88 which led to much work overseas, and his role as Officer Matt Doyle on The New Adam-12 (Universal Studios) 1989 through 1991. He appeared as an expert on John Wayne memorabilia on History Channel's Pawn Stars in the episode \"Dog Day Afternoon\" which aired January 14, 2014." ;

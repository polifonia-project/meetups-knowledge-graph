        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Sarnoff (February 27, 1891 â€“ December 12, 1971) was an American businessman and pioneer of American radio and television. Throughout most of his career, he led the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in various capacities from shortly after its founding in 1919 until his retirement in 1970. He ruled over an ever-growing telecommunications and media empire that included both RCA and NBC, and became one of the largest companies in the world. Named a Reserve Brigadier General of the Signal Corps in 1945, Sarnoff thereafter was widely known as \"The General.\" Sarnoff is credited with Sarnoff's law, which states that the value of a broadcast network is proportional to the number of viewers." ;

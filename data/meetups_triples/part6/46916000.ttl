        mtp:hasAbstract        "Junior Jos√© Guerra Maurera (born January 16, 1985) is a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher for the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos of the Mexican League. He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Los Angeles Angels. He was originally signed by the Atlanta Braves in 2001. Guerra is notable for his development of a split-finger fastball, a pitch which he learned while playing in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League and ultimately led to his 2015 return to the MLB. Guerra said of the pitch in 2017, \"I have no idea where I would be without it.\"" ;

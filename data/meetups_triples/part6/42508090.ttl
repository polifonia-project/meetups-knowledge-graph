        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jarekus Singleton (born July 11, 1984, in Clinton, Mississippi, United States) is an American blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. Refuse To Lose was his first nationally and internationally distributed album. It was released on the Chicago-based independent blues record label Alligator Records on May 6, 2014. England's Blues & Rhythm called Singleton \"a great, new blues talent…young, original, soulful and intense…superb, blistering guitar.\" According to Living Blues magazine, \"Jarekus Singleton is making some serious blues noise...blending modern-day blues and emotionally intense soul with melodic, hot-toned lead guitar, funk-seasoned rhythms and hip-hop flavored lyrics.\" The Washington Post said, \"Jarekus Singleton is an exciting new young blues guitarist with melody, hooks, swagger and a strong, original voice. His lyrics are modern, personal, acutely poetic and deeply mature.\" USA Today said of Singleton, \"Stinging blues guitar and potent, original songs herald the emergence of a major new talent.\"" ;

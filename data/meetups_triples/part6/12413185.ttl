His father was an Edo doctor, but Kikaku chose to become a professional haikai poet rather than follow in his footsteps. Kikaku set the tone for haikai from Basho death until the time of Yosa Buson in the late 18th century; and he also left an important historical document, describing Bashō's final days, and the immediate aftermath of his death, which has been translated into English." ;

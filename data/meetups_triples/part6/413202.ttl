        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frederick Sewards Trueman, OBE (6 February 1931 â€“ 1 July 2006) was an English cricketer who played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club and the England cricket team. He had professional status and later became an author and broadcaster. Acknowledged as one of the greatest bowlers in cricket's history, Trueman deployed a genuinely fast pace and was widely known as \"Fiery Fred\". He was the first bowler to take 300 wickets in a Test career. Together with Brian Statham, he opened the England bowling for many years and they formed one of the most famous bowling partnerships in Test cricket history. Trueman was an outstanding fielder, especially at leg slip, and a useful late order batsman who made three first-class centuries. He was awarded his Yorkshire county cap in 1951 and in 1952 was elected \"Young Cricketer of the Year\" by the Cricket Writers' Club. For his performances in the 1952 season, he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1953 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. His talent, skill and public profile were such that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson jokingly described him as the \"greatest living Yorkshireman\". Even so, Trueman was omitted from numerous England teams because he was frequently in conflict with the cricket establishment, which he often criticised for its perceived \"snobbishness\" and hypocrisy. After he retired from playing, he became a media personality through his work in television and as an outspoken radio commentator for the BBC, mainly working on Test Match Special. He was awarded the OBE in the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to cricket. In 2009, Trueman was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. On the occasion of England's 1000th Test in August 2018, he was named in the country's greatest Test XI by the ECB." ;

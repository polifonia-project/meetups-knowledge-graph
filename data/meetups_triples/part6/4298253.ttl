He was first a member of the R&B group Mista in 1994, before signing to rapper Ludacris through his label imprint, Disturbing tha Peace under Def Jam Recordings in 2005. Bobby V's first single as a solo artist, \"Slow Down\", released in February 2005, peaked at number 8 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. The single was certified gold by the RIAA and became the lead single for his eponymous debut album (2005)â€”which peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200 and had a follow up single, \"Tell Me\" (featuring Lil Wayne). His next album, Special Occasion was released in May 2007, and warranted success from its second single, \"Anonymous\" (featuring Timbaland).

He has been a Senator since 2011 and previously served as the Senate President of the Philippines from 2016 to 2018. He is also the national chairman of Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan (PDP–Laban). As the eldest son and third child of the former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr., he is the first child of a previous Senate president to hold the office. He was sworn in on August 12, 2011 and was proclaimed as the 12th winning senator in the 2007 election. Pimentel was one of the high-ranking public officials who drew flak for breaching the COVID-19 quarantine protocols." ;

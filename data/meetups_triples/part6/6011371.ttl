        mtp:hasAbstract        "José Reinaldo de Lima (born 11 January 1957) is a former Brazilian footballer who played as a striker. He is popularly known as Reinaldo or Rei (The King). Widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers in the history of Brazilian football, Reinaldo played most of his career for Atlético Mineiro, is considered by many the most important player in the club, and still holds the record of highest goal average per game in the Brazilian league, with 1.55 goals per match in the 1977 Brazilian Championship, at a time when Atlético Mineiro was regarded to have one of the best teams in the world. Legendary Brazilian midfielder Zico considered him the best player he had ever seen, believing that he would have been the greatest Brazilian player after Pelé if not for injuries." ;

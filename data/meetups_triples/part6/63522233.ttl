        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alice Victoria Rose Chater (born 5 April 1995) is a British singer, songwriter and dancer. After releasing covers online throughout the mid-2010s, she eventually signed to Virgin EMI. Since then, she has released several singles, including \"Lola\" by Iggy Azalea and \"Got It All\" by Professor Green. She peaked at #3 on US Billboard Next Big Sound Chart. Alice collaborated with Professor Green on 'Got It All', a song that hit No.2 on UK iTunes, trended at No.6 on YouTube and was added to Hot Hits UK on Spotify. It was also her first entry on official singles chart in the UK, peaking at #48 and spent a total of three weeks on the chart. The same year she headlined as one of the front acts of Céline Dion's show at BST Hyde Park music festival. Furthermore, Chater has performed across the UK with full-throttle performances including the Mighty Hoopla festival and Brighton Pride alongside Kylie Minogue. In September 2019, Alice set out on her first UK headline tour, which included her second sold out London show. Gay Times UK hailed her as \"Britain’s new pop princess\"." ;

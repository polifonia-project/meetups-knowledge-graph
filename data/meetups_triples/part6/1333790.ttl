        mtp:hasAbstract        "Scott Matthew Parker (born 13 October 1980) is an English professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. He was most recently the head coach of Premier League club AFC Bournemouth. Parker began his career at Charlton Athletic, and was loaned to Norwich City, before joining Chelsea for a £10 million fee in January 2004. He did not play regularly at Chelsea, and moved to Newcastle United the following year, where he was made captain. Parker joined West Ham United in 2007, and was the FWA Footballer of the Year for the 2010–11 season despite the club being relegated. He was then signed by Tottenham Hotspur and joined Fulham in 2013. He would play 119 league matches for Fulham in both the Premier League and the Championship, before retiring at the end of the 2016–17 season. Parker has represented England at every level from under-16 to senior, making his full debut in 2003. Uniquely, he won his first four England caps while playing for four different clubs. Parker was a member of the England team which reached the quarter-finals at UEFA Euro 2012. Following his retirement, Parker pursued a career in management. He was appointed caretaker manager of Fulham in February 2019, before being appointed on a permanent basis that summer. In his first season in charge, Parker guided Fulham to promotion to the Premier League after winning the Championship play-offs. However, Fulham were relegated back to the Championship the following season, after which Parker left to join AFC Bournemouth, also in the Championship, and went on to guide them to promotion in his first season. However, after a 9–0 loss to Liverpool in the club's fourth league game of the season, Parker was relieved of his duties as head coach." ;

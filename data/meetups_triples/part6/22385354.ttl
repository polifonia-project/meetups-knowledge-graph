She learned to play guitar as a youngster and wrote songs from an early age. Trini met producer Nicholas Ray in the 1960s, and he encouraged her to move to London; soon after she left for Paris, where she eventually signed to a record label. Her debut album was released in 1969, and through the 1970s and 1980s was a popular figure in Spanish pop music. Mari Trini died in Murcia in 2009, from lung cancer." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edison Chen Koon-hei (simplified Chinese: 陈冠希; traditional Chinese: 陳冠希; pinyin: Chén Guān Xī, born Chen Hing-wah on 7 October 1980) is a Canadian-born Hong Kong actor, singer, rapper, fashion designer and entrepreneur. Chen is the co-founder of CLOT, a Hong Kong-based streetwear and fashion label. Debuting in 1999, he released multiple Cantopop and Mandopop albums under the record company Emperor Entertainment Group, before releasing Please Steal This Album in 2004, the first of many Chinese-language hip-hop albums. On 21 February 2008, he publicly announced that he intended to step away \"indefinitely\" from the Hong Kong entertainment industry due to a sex photo scandal, in which numerous explicit photographs of Chen and several Hong Kong actresses were published online. He returned in 2010 but other than a brief cameo in the 2014 film Golden Chickensss, he did not make a complete comeback to the Hong Kong film industry until 2016." ;

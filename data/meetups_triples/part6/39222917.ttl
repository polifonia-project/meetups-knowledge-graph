Hiskins, one of 14 siblings, had three elder brothers that played in the VFL, Arthur, Fred and Stan. He served with the Light Horse Brigade during the First World War. Already 26 by the time he debuted in 1920, Hiskins played five seasons at Carlton, usually in the ruck, resting on the half back flank and wing. He played in the 1921 VFL Grand Final, which Carlton lost by four points. Hiskins was a member of Brunswick's 1925 VFA premiership team." ;

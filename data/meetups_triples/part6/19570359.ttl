        mtp:hasAbstract        "Evgeny Mogilevsky (born 16 september 1945 in Odessa) is a Russian pianist. Son and pupil of Seraphima Mogilevsky at the Stolyarsky Music school in his hometown. Later studied with Heinrich Neuhaus and Yakov Zak at the Moscow Conservatory. Father of the pianists Maxim and Alexander Mogilevsky. In 1964 at the age of 18 he became the third Soviet pianist to win the Queen Elisabeth Competition, after Emil Gilels and Vladimir Ashkenazy. He has had a significant career, including internationally (in the USA as a Sol Hurok artist). In the latter half of the 1970s he performed throughout the world as a soloist with the USSR State Symphony Orchestra under Yevgeny Svetlanov. His recording of Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto (Kirill Kondrashin conducting) won several prizes. In 1992 began teaching at the Brussels Conservatory. Alexander Mogilevsky, violinist, was the brother of his grandfather." ;

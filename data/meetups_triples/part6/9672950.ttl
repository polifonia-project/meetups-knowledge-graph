        mtp:hasAbstract        "William H. Barrington-Coupe (born William Halford Barrington Coupe, 1931 â€“ 19 October 2014 and known as Barry) was a British record producer and music impresario. Married in 1956 to concert pianist Joyce Hatto, he was jailed for a year in 1966 for \"blatant and impertinent frauds\". He attained further notoriety in 2007 when he confessed that a large number of piano CDs that he had sold on his Concert Artist/Fidelio Recordings label were not in fact performed by his wife but were copies, in some cases digitally manipulated, of commercially available recordings by other pianists." ;

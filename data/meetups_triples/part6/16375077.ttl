She was born and educated in Hungary, and received her Ph.D. from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest. She is currently a professor of linguistics at New York University. She has been a research fellow at the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, and a professor at UCLA.

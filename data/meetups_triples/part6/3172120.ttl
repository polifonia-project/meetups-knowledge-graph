        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nati Ninet Tayeb (Hebrew: נינט טייב; born October 21, 1983), commonly known as Ninet, is an Israeli musician, singer-songwriter, composer, DJ, model, actress, and a reality television program judge in Rising Star: Israel. She is considered among the most famous people in the Israeli entertainment industry, and was labeled in 2015 as \"One of the hottest new artists to break into the United States.\" Ninet has released four successful albums in Israel (one of them in English), and has twice won Israel's Favorite Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards. She has also worked with producer Mike Crossey (who produced her third album, Sympathetic Nervous System), and artists such as Steven Wilson, Gary Lucas, Cyndi Lauper, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and The Dead Daisies. Alongside her musical career, Ninet has enjoyed a successful acting career, performing in movies, scripted series, and the theatre. One of her first roles in theatre was Wendla in the Israeli production of Spring Awakening. In 2018 Ninet had a role in the Israeli TV series, When Heroes Fly. Tayeb was also the singing voice for Mary Poppins in the Hebrew dub of the Disney movie, as well as the singing voice of Tiana in the Hebrew dub for Disney's The Princess And The Frog. Ninet finished her first high-profile international tour in the U.S, Canada (Toronto & Montreal), and Europe in 2016. The tour featured songs from her recent release. It was her 5th album and the first to be released and promoted in the U.S. As part of her tour, Ninet was selected to perform at SXSW in March 2016. She was also featured as a guest vocalist on Steven Wilson's tour, who, after their successful collaborations in the past, invited her to join him for several performances. The 2016 tour was the result of Ninet's short visit to the U.S in 2015, which created an extensive buzz and high demand for this \"infectious female artist\". During her time in the U.S, Ninet performed several concerts in New York City, which were praised by the critics. One of the critics stated that \"having seen Ninet perform … it’s safe to say that the entire audience was fixated and almost hypnotized by her presence.\" Others claimed that \"her bold renditions of songs like 'Crazy' and her original releases have showcased the range in which she approaches music and thus identifies with at least some part of all of us.\" In preparation for her 2016 tour, Ninet released two new singles from her upcoming album – \"Paper Parachute\" and \"Child\". The two \"promise an album worth waiting for\", and were described as ones in which Ninet's \"haunting vocals are backed by clever production work and energy fulfilling beats\"." ;

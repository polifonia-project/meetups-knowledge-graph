As an adult, Smith became a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, ministering at several churches until his death in 2002. Kaye was \"discovered\" in 1935 while his family was on vacation in Hollywood, California; he was asked to come to the studios for a screen test, and made some uncredited appearances in films in 1936." ;

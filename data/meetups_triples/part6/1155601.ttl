        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elaine Morgan OBE, FRSL (7 November 1920 â€“ 12 July 2013), was a Welsh writer for television and the author of several books on evolutionary anthropology. She advocated the aquatic ape hypothesis, which she advocated as a corrective to what she saw as theories that purveyed gendered stereotypes and so failed to take adequate account of women's role in human evolution. The Descent of Woman, published in 1972, became an international bestseller, translated into ten languages. In 2016, she was named as one of \"the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time\" in a press survey." ;

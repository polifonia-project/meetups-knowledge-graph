        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marco Tutino (born May 30, 1954) is an Italian composer. His emergence during the late 1970s was as the spearhead of an Italian Neo-Romantico group, founded with two other composers, Lorenzo Ferrero and Carlo Galante. He graduated from the Milan Conservatory, where he had studied flute and composition (with Giacomo Manzoni), in 1982. He has composed operas, chamber music and symphonic works which have been performed by important Italian orchestras and concert societies. Some have been performed by music institutions in other countries, notably the BBC Philharmonic, The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, Copenhagen Radio Symphony Orchestra, and The San Francisco Chamber Orchestra." ;

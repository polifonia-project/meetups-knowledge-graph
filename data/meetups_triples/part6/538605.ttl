He won Saturn and MTV Movie Awards for his breakthrough performance at age 13 as John Connor in James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day; which was followed by a mini-sequel, short attraction film T2-3D: Battle Across Time co-directed and co-written by Cameron with the same main cast. In 1992, he gave an Independent Spirit Award-nominated turn opposite Jeff Bridges in American Heart, and earned a second Saturn Award nomination for his work in Pet Sematary Two. He won a Young Artist Award for his performance alongside Kathy Bates in A Home of Our Own (1993) and appeared in Before and After (1996) with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson. Furlong received acclaim for his starring roles in the 1998 motion pictures Pecker, co-starring Christina Ricci, and American History X, co-starring Edward Norton.

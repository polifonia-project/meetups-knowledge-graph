In 1582 Philip II of Spain, recently declared king also of Portugal, visitedSetúbal, where Terzi was recommended to him on the occasion of a new fortification needed to reinforce the security of that port city. Having achieved the work successfully, Terzi was named master of work at the Convento de Cristo in Tomar, in 1584. In 1590, he was named Mestre das Obras de el-Rei, \"Master of the King's works\", succeeding the post that had been occupied by . Terzi was also charged with the instruction of a new generation of young architects in the Royal Works. He was responsible for numerous projects, notably at Coimbra and Lisbon, including the aqueduct that led from São Sebastião to Coimbra." ;

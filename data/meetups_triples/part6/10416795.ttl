He was a prominent exponent of the samba-canção genre. He dubbed his own style, dor-de-cotovelo (literally \"elbow pain\"), inspired by his experiences with heartbreak. His compositions have been performed and recorded by many musicians, including Jamelão, who recorded two albums exclusively devoted to his compositions. Rodrigues is also famous for having written the anthem of Grêmio." ;

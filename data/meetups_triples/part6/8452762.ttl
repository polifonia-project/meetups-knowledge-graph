        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ramon Bautista Bong Revilla Jr. (Tagalog: [rɛˈbiʎɐ]; born Jose Mari Bautista; September 25, 1966) and commonly known as Bong Revilla, is a Filipino actor, television presenter and politician serving as a Senator since 2019, and previously from 2004 to 2016. The son of actor-politician Ramon Revilla Sr., he himself became an action star in the 1980s and 1990s as Ramon \"Bong\" Revilla Jr. He started his political career in Cavite, serving as vice governor (1995–1998) and later governor (1998–2001). He was the chairman of the Videogram Regulatory Board from 2002 to 2004. Revilla was first elected to the Senate in 2004. He successfully ran for a second term and topped the senatorial race in 2010. His alleged involvement in the Napoles pork barrel scam led the Sandiganbayan to issue an arrest warrant against him and other co-accused on June 20, 2014. Within hours, Revilla surrendered before the anti-graft court. Bong Revilla was acquitted of plunder and released on December 7, 2018, but was required to return to the government ₱124.5 million (US$2.53 million) in civil liability. He stood accused of 16 counts of graft for his alleged role in the transfer of ‎₱517 million (US$10.5 million) of his discretionary funds to bogus foundations until all cases was junked by Sandiganbayan on 2021, however, he has yet to return the required amount he was asked to give back before his acquittal. He later secured a comeback to the Senate in 2019." ;

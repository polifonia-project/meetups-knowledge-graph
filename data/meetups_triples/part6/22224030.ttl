        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sam Childers (born 1963), also known as the Machine Gun Preacher, is an American motorcyclist, author, and humanitarian. A Detroit Highwaymen Motorcycle Club member, Childers became well known after Dateline NBC's (Keith Morrison and Tim Sandler) story about him and his interactions with Joseph Kony (leader of the Lord's Resistance Army) in 2005 and now dedicates his life and resources to rescue children in the war zone of South Sudan. Childers and his wife Lynn founded and operate Angels of East Africa, the Children's Village Orphanage in Nimule, South Sudan, where they currently have around 185 children in their care. Childers also has orphanages and homes in Uganda and Ethiopia with another 160 children in his organisation's care. In 2013, Childers received the Mother Teresa Award for Social Justice." ;

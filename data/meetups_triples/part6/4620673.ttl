        mtp:hasAbstract        "Graeme Emerson Bell, AO, MBE (7 September 1914 – 13 June 2012) was an Australian Dixieland and classical jazz pianist, composer and band leader. According to The Age, his \"band's music was hailed for its distinctive Australian edge, which he describes as 'nice larrikinism' and 'a happy Aussie outdoor feel'\". Bell was one of the leading promoters of jazz in Australia, bringing American performers such as Rex Stewart to Australia. He was the first Australian jazz band leader who was still playing at 90 years of age and the first Westerner to lead a jazz band to China. The American music journal DownBeat said: \"Bell's is unquestionably the greatest jazz band outside America\". The Australian Jazz Awards commenced in 2003. They are also known as The Bells in his honour." ;

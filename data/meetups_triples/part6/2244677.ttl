He has founded the bands Josh Joplin Group and Among The Oak & Ash. His song \"Camera One\" was the first independent release to hit #1 at Triple A radio. His song \"Blue Skies Again\" was recorded by Jessica Lea Mayfield for her Nonesuch debut, Tell Me. Pitchfork praised it as, \"simple, the infectious chorus makes it a standout...it's also a sunny, reassuring song.\" Joplin has toured extensively in North America, Europe, and Australia, and has recorded several albums with different bands." ;

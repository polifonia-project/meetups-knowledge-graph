        mtp:hasAbstract        "Moon Geun-young (Korean: 문근영; Hanja: 文瑾瑩; born May 6, 1987) is a South Korean actress. Affectionately called the \"Nation's Little Sister,\" Moon began modeling at the age of 10, then made her acting debut in 1999 as a child actress. She first rose to stardom through her role as the young Eun-suh in the hugely popular television drama series Autumn in My Heart (2000), followed by a well-received turn in Kim Jee-woon's critically acclaimed horror film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003). Moon solidified her star status by headlining the box-office hits My Little Bride (2004) and Innocent Steps (2005). At age 21, she became the youngest recipient of a Grand Prize (\"Daesang\") which she won at SBS Drama Awards for the television series Painter of the Wind (2008)." ;

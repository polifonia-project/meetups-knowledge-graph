        mtp:hasAbstract        "Silton Ray Fontenot (born August 8, 1957, in Lake Charles, Louisiana) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for four seasons between 1983 and 1986. He played for three teams in those four years â€“ the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs and Minnesota Twins. Fontenot, a 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m), 175 pounds (79 kg) left-hander, was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 34th round (815th overall) of the 1979 amateur entry draft. He had great success in the minors, with an ERA of 3.16, striking out 377 batters in more than 399 innings pitched. He was used mostly as a starter, although he pitched in relief in 1983." ;

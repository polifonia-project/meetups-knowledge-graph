        mtp:hasAbstract        "Niamh Kavanagh (/ˈniːv ˈkævənɑː/ NEEV KAV-ə-nah; born 13 February 1968) is an Irish singer who sang the winning entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1993. The 1993 Eurovision Song Contest was held in Millstreet, County Cork, Republic of Ireland. She sang \"In Your Eyes\" to clinch a second consecutive win for Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. The singer represented Ireland again in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, with the song \"It's for You\". She performed at the semi-final on 27 May 2010, finishing 9th in a field of 17 contestants, thus qualifying for the Grand Final on 29 May 2010. In the final, she finished 23rd in a field of 25 contestants, having received 25 points. Kavanagh is highly regarded among fans of the Eurovision Song Contest, and the OGAE Ireland (official Eurovision fan club) president, Diarmuid Furlong, said: \"A lot of us would regard Niamh as one of the best vocalists who's ever won the Eurovision Song Contest\". While she has enjoyed success in Europe Kavanagh remains relatively unknown in the United States. However, the singer recorded an album in that country following her initial Eurovision success." ;

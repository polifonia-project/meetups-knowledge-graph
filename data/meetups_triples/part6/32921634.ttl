In 1933 it was claimed she was one of only five female film directors in the world. At one stage they had offers to go to Hollywood. \"Fox Films offered to send us,\" said Phyllis McDonagh, \"But we were sensible girls. We sat down and talked and decided we would end up very small fish in a big pond. At home we had work and a reputation.\"" ;

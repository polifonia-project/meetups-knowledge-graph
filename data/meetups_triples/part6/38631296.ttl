        mtp:hasAbstract        "Austin Lee Russell (born September 8, 1982), better known by his stage name Chumlee, is an American businessman and reality television personality, best known for his appearances on the History Channel television show Pawn Stars, which depicts day-to-day business at the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas where he works. Chumlee went to work at the pawn shop five years before filming the first season, having been a childhood friend of Corey Harrison whose father and grandfather founded the shop. Chumlee is often portrayed on the show as the comic foil, but he often appraises items in his areas of expertise, including pinball machines, sneakers, and video games." ;

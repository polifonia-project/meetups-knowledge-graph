He made several field trips to Mexico, and presented specimens to the Smithsonian and the New York Botanical Garden. With Nathaniel Lord Britton, Rose published many articles on the Crassulaceae. He took a leave of absence from the Smithsonian to do further fieldwork in South America and publish with Britton, the four-volume work, The Cactaceae (1919–1923), illustrated by Mary Emily Eaton (1873–1961). Rose returned to work afterwards at the Smithsonian, making further contributions to Botany.

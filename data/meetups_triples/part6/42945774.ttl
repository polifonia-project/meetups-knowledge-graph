        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frank Heiss (July 24, 1971 â€“ April 15, 2018) was an American electronic record producer best known by his alias HEISS. He previously toured and/or recorded under the aliases as tube, HearNow, Bionic Harmonic, and The Hick Step Massive. Heiss has released a large number of LPs, EPs, singles, and remixes, and in 2013 released the original album Ascensio(N), which Lost in Sound described as spiritual in tone, stating that \"each track is stylistically unique. Heiss weaves through styles...from jazz fusion to drum n bass to reggae, and everything in between.\" The following year he released the remix album Awaken(D), featuring guest artists such as D.V.S*. Heiss was the owner of the record label Transcendent Tunes, which features music by future bass producers who seek a connection to the Divine." ;

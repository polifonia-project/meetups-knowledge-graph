Throughout his career, he has participated in numerous bands, with the most notable being Autograph, Mavrik, and Aria. Arthur was born in Kharkiv, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, to a family of Moscow circus troupers during their Ukrainian tour. Since 1984, Arthur has performed under his stage name, \"Berkut\", which is Russian for golden eagle. Together with Autograph, Berkut toured over the United States in 1989, but in 1990, during the tour, Autograph disbanded.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Franco Franchi (born Francesco Benenato; 18 September 1928 â€“ 9 December 1992) was an Italian actor, comedian and singer. He was born in Palermo, Sicily and began his career in the 1950s, although his career only really took off in the 1960s. He starred in many comedies, mainly appearing together with Ciccio Ingrassia as the comedy duo Franco and Ciccio, but also in more dramatic material such as Luigi Comencini's Adventures of Pinocchio (1972), in which they paired memorably as the Fox and the Cat. In the film Due Marines e un Generale (1966), he worked with Buster Keaton and Ciccio Ingrassia." ;

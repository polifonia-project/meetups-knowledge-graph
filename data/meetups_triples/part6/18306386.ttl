        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ghulam Ahmed Chishti (Punjabi, Urdu: غُلام احمد چِشتی), (often abbreviated to G.A. Chishti) (Punjabi, Urdu: جی اے چِشتی), (17 August 1905 – 25 December 1994) was a Pakistani music composer, attributed as being one of the founders of Indian and Pakistani film music. He is also sometimes referred to as Baba Chishti. Working with filmi music, Chishti excelled at Punjabi compositions and was 'apt at weaving the design of influences around Punjabi music'. With almost 5,000 tunes to his credit, he composed scores for 140 – 150 films and was the first musician to reach the '100 films' threshold in newly independent Pakistan after 1947. Being a poet, he had written lyrics for 12 of the most popular Pakistani film songs besides writing hundreds of other film songs during his career." ;

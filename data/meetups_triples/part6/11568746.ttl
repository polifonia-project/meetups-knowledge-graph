        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mauro Maur, the Pavarotti of the trumpet, OMRI (born 8 August 1958) is an Italian trumpeter and composer who represents the Italian musician with a pure and unique style. After performing as a soloist at the Carnegie Hall at the age of 20 and traveling around the world playing in the largest concert halls for decades, he contributes with his art as a trumpet virtuoso to the knowledge of the Italian musical tradition to the highest level in the world alongside musicians such as Placido Domingo, Uto Ughi, Riccardo Muti, Leonard Bernstein, Seiji Ozawa, Pierre Boulez, but also Tony Scott, Oscar Valdambrini, Nini Rosso, Paquito D'Rivera, Gloria Gaynor. Requested for the unique sound of his trumpet, Ennio Morricone has wanted to collaborate with him since 1985 for more than 20 years. Ennio Morricone has dedicated his concert for trumpet \"Ut\" to him along with other many cinematic pieces in concert form." ;

She is specifically known for her work with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Keibler began her professional wrestling career as a part of the Nitro Girls in WCW. She quickly moved on to a more prominent role in the company as the manager Miss Hancock. As Miss Hancock, Keibler was known for doing table dances, her relationship with David Flair, and a pregnancy angle. After WCW was purchased by the WWF (later WWE) in 2001, Keibler moved to the new company, using her real name and taking part in the Invasion storyline, also managing the Dudley Boyz. Keibler also managed Test and Scott Steiner. Before her departure from WWE in 2006, she was affiliated with The Hurricane and Rosey and nicknamed \"Super Stacy.\" Keibler was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars: season two, where she placed third. She has also appeared on other ABC series such as What About Brian, George Lopez, and October Road, as well as the 100th episode of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother as a bartender and on the USA Network show Psych. Keibler has also modeled, appearing in both Maxim and Stuff magazines. Keibler is considered to be a sex symbol and is known for her unusually long legs. She has been known as both \"The Legs of WCW\" and \"The Legs of WWE\". During Keibler's time on Dancing with the Stars, judge Bruno Tonioli nicknamed her \"The Weapon of Mass Seduction.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gregory Lynn Cook (November 20, 1946 â€“ January 27, 2012) was an American football quarterback who played two professional seasons, in the American Football League (AFL) and later the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Cincinnati and was selected 5th overall in the 1969 NFL/AFL draft. Once considered a rising star for the Cincinnati Bengals, he had his pro career prematurely ended by recurring shoulder troubles. In 2007, NFL Films named Cook as the number one greatest NFL \"one-shot wonder\" of all-time, describing him as one of the biggest \"what-ifs\" in league history, in the seventh installment of its program NFL Top 10." ;

He played with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and played with other Chicago blues musicians in the 1960s, then left music for most of the 1970s. He returned to music in the late 1970s and continued performing until his death in 2010. His elder brother was the bluesman Otis \"Big Smokey\" Smothers (died 1993), with whom he was sometimes confused." ;

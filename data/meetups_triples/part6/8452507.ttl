        mtp:hasAbstract        "Manuel \"Lito\" Mercado Lapid (Tagalog pronunciation: [maˈnwel ˈlito ˈlapid]; born October 25, 1955) is a Filipino actor and politician serving as a Senator since 2019, and previously from 2004 to 2016. He started his political career in Pampanga, serving as vice governor from 1992 to 1995, and governor from 1995 to 2004. In 2015, he was charged for graft over his alleged involvement in the 2004 Fertilizer Fund scam while he was governor of Pampanga, but the case was dismissed in 2016 by the Sandiganbayan anti-graft court due to the \"inordinate delay\" in the investigation." ;

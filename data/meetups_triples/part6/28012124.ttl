His area of specialty is ballads, although he has also worked in a variety of other genres. Pérez has produced more than 70 albums, composed over 1,000 songs (over 300 of which have been #1 or have reached the Top 10 Charts), and written and produced music for popular international artists such as Westlife, Natalie Cole, José Feliciano, Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel, Raúl di Blasio, Jaci Velasquez, Cristian Castro, Christina Aguilera, Michael Bolton, Luis Fonsi, Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Il Divo, and Beyoncé. He has won many music awards throughout his career, including being voted the most important Latin composer four times (four years), and winning the title of Producer of the Decade in 2010, awarded by Billboard to the producer with the most top ten hits of the decade. He is the first Latin producer to win Billboard's Producer of the Year award four years consecutively. Pérez owns the record labels Rudy Pérez Enterprises (RPE) and Bullseye Productions. He is a founding partner and the Chief Creative Officer of DiGa Entertainment and the co-founder of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (LARAS), the Latin Grammys. He was instrumental in the production of the premiere of the inaugural Latin Grammy Awards of 2000 and is on the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). In April 2013, Pérez (along with Desmond Child) created the Pabellón de la Fama de los Compositores Latinos (Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame; LSHOF), in Miami Beach, to honor the most important Latino composers and to drive them to continue creating Latin music." ;

He has since parted ways with the band and now produces at his own recording studio (though he was involved with the band's writing sessions for a couple more of their albums). He continues to write and produce music for various other bands, with Secrets (post-hardcore band) being one of his main projects. Tomâ€™s current band is Sounds Like Color, with Jesse Smarslok on vocals." ;

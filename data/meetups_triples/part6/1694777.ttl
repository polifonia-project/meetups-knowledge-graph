        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kong Hee (Chinese: 康希; pinyin: Kāng Xī; born 23 August 1964) is the founder and senior pastor of City Harvest Church. He was convicted in 2015 of being involved in the City Harvest Church Criminal Breach of Trust Case, Singapore's biggest case in misuse of charitable funds. He was seen to be the \"key man\" behind the scandal who had guided his five accomplices by the Singapore court of three charges of criminal breach of trust. Although Kong and the five were guilty of serious breaches, the court noted that the $50 million was also ultimately returned to the church. He served his sentence at Changi Prison Complex from 21 April 2017 to 22 August 2019. Kong is also involved in the Christian Charismatic Movement, a philosophy of ministry that emphasises the Great Commandment, the Great Commission and the Cultural Mandate." ;

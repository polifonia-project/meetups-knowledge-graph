        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Paul Gannon (born 7 September 1968) is a professional football manager and former player who most recently was manager of Hyde United. He started and finished his career as a player in Ireland, but made most of his professional appearances in the English Football League at Stockport County, where supporters elected him as a member of the Hall of Fame. Gannon began his playing career at Dundalk, but moved to English club Sheffield United in 1989. The next year he transferred to Stockport County, following a short loan spell with Halifax Town. He spent the next ten years at Stockport, becoming one of the club's most loyal servants, and helped the club to second-place finishes in both the Second Division and Fourth Division, as well as two League Trophy finals. After leaving the club in 2000, he spent a season with Crewe Alexandra, before returning to Ireland with Shelbourne, winning two League of Ireland Premier Division titles in his three years there. Starting a career in management, he took charge of his first club Dundalk in 2004. After a season in Ireland he returned to Stockport County as manager. There he led the club to promotion from League Two via the play-offs in 2008. Leading County to safety in League One despite a ten-point deduction for entering administration, he lost his job as part of a cost-cutting measure. Heading to Scottish Premier League side Motherwell, he managed the club in the Europa League, but left after just 25 games in charge. He took charge of Championship side Peterborough United in 2010, but stayed at the struggling club for only two months, turning down a four-year contract. In January 2011 he was appointed manager of Port Vale, but lasted just ten weeks in the job. He returned to Stockport in November 2011, as the club's director of football and manager, before being sacked in January 2013. He took charge at Northwich Victoria in December 2013. He spent just over two years with Northwich before returning to manage Stockport County for the third time in January 2016. He led the club to promotion as National League North champions at the end of the 2018â€“19 season. He left Stockport in January 2021 and took charge at Hyde United for a short spell eight months later." ;

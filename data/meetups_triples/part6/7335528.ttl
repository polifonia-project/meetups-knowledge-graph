        mtp:hasAbstract        "Liu Fang (Chinese: t 劉芳, s 刘芳, p Liú Fāng; b. 1974) is a Chinese–Canadian musician who is one of the most prominent pipa players in the world. Described in the media as the \"empress of pipa\" (L'actualité), \"divine mediator\" (World), \"the greatest ambassadress of the art of the pipa\", Liu Fang is known as \"possessing virtuoso technique, grace and a unique empathy toward the music she plays – whether it is a traditional and folk tune or a modern Western composition\" (All Music Guide). \"She has an extraordinary focused, poised presence in her manner and her playing. In a lesser player this is just a trained formality; the body of material and techniques for her instruments is extremely highly developed, passed down through centuries. But Liu Fang’s total devotion to her playing has moved her beyond perfect execution to the creativity and flexibility that marks a true musician.\"(in the fRoots Magazine, 06.2006)." ;

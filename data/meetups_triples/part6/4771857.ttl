Though he primarily plays the guitar, he has played the drums, piano, percussion, saxophone, and glockenspiel on some albums. He released his second album in 1997, which contained his breakout and most famous single \"One More Time, One More Chance.\" This song was used in Makoto Shinkai's anime film 5 Centimeters per Second. In September 2002, he performed the Beatles song \"All My Loving\" for Sir Paul McCartney." ;

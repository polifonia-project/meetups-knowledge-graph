        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ruth-Ann Boyle (born 26 April 1970, Sunderland, England) is an English pop singer. Together with producers Tim Kellett and Robin Taylor-Firth, she formed the British band Olive. The band's single \"You're Not Alone\" reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart on its second release in 1997. In 1999 she sang lead vocals on tracks \"Gravity of Love\" and \"Silence Must Be Heard\" on Enigma's album The Screen Behind the Mirror, the former of which was also released as a single. She also performed guest-vocals for their 2003 album Voyageur. Her first solo album What About Us?, produced by Michael Cretu of Enigma, was only released as a digital download via iTunes in 2007, quoting a lack of necessary project support and co-ordination to produce physical copies of the album." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Karla Bonoff (born December 27, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter. While Bonoff has released a number of albums, she is primarily known for her songwriting. Bonoff's songs include \"Home,\" covered by Bonnie Raitt, \"Tell Me Why\" by Wynonna Judd, and \"Isn't It Always Love\" by Lynn Anderson. Most notably, Linda Ronstadt recorded several Bonoff songs, including three tracks on the 1976 album Hasten Down the Wind (\"Someone To Lay Down Beside Me\", \"Lose Again\" and \"If He's Ever Near\"), which introduced Bonoff to a mass audience, and \"All My Life\", a 1989 duet with Ronstadt and Aaron Neville." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Major-General John Frederick Charles \"Boney\" Fuller CB CBE DSO (1 September 1878 â€“ 10 February 1966) was a senior British Army officer, military historian, and strategist, known as an early theorist of modern armoured warfare, including categorising principles of warfare. With 45 books and many articles, he was a highly prolific author whose ideas reached army officers and the interested public. He explored the business of fighting, in terms of the relationship between warfare and social, political, and economic factors in the civilian sector. Fuller emphasised the potential of new weapons, especially tanks and aircraft, to stun a surprised enemy psychologically. Fuller supported the organised British fascist movement. He was also an occultist and Thelemite who wrote a number of works on esotericism and mysticism." ;

The song \"No Aphrodisiac\", co-written by Freedman, was their break-through hit in 1997; their top four ARIA albums are Love This City (1999), Torch the Moon (2002), Little Cloud (2006) and compilation, Truth, Beauty and a Picture of You: Best of the Whitlams in 2008. A highlight of his career was receiving an ARIA Music Award for 'Song of the Year' in 1998 from the former Australian prime minister, Gough Whitlamâ€”after whom his band is named." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Al-Hurr ibn Yazid ibn Najiyah Al-Tamimi Al-Yarbuʿi Ar-Riyahi (Arabic: حر بن یزید بن الناجیة التمیمي الیربوعي الریاحي) was the general of the Umayyad army dispatched from Kufa, Iraq to intercept al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Abu Talib. The newly appointed governor of Kufa, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, issued the command to guard all entrances and exits to Kufa in order to intercept al-Husayn for an oath of allegiance to Yazid ibn Mu'awiya ibn Abu Sufyan of the Umayyad dynasty. Al-Hurr ibn Yazid al-Tamimi al-Yarbu'i was to guard one of the roads with his 1,000 soldiers to sanction al-Husayn and his followers and bring them to Ibn Ziyad. Initially responsible for holding al-Husayn and his followers captive, al-Hurr died fighting on al-Husayn's behalf after decisions fueled by corrupt intentions surfaced from Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Al-Hurr's short but provocative mark on history spans less than one week's time, but is embedded with complex details and fatal turns of events that led to the martyrdom of al-Husayn during the Battle of Karbala." ;

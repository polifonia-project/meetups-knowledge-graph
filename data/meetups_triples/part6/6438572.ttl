        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Lynch (born June 11, 1946) is a Canadian film director and television director. Lynch came to Canada in 1960. He left school to become a cartoonist for the Toronto Star and then served as a photographer for a number of small-town newspapers. This led to work in film, including a 90-minute documentary on Penthouse magazine commissioned by its publisher, Bob Guccione. His first feature film was The Hard Part Begins. This was followed by the box-office hit Prom Night, a straightforward slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. Lynch has only made movies periodically, pursuing instead a career directing for American television." ;

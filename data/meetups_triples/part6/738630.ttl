        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Francis Allen (July 2, 1927 â€“ October 18, 1994) was an American tenor saxophone player. Phil Alvin, Allen's bandmate in The Blasters, called him one of the most important instrumentalists in rock'n'roll. Allen's distinctive tone has been hailed as \"one of the defining sounds of rock'n'roll\" and \"one of the DNA strands of rock.\" Allen was a key figure in New Orleans rock and roll of the 1950s and recorded with many leading performers of the early rock and roll era. He was semiretired from music by the late 1960s, but in the late 1970s returned to performing intermittently until the end of his life." ;

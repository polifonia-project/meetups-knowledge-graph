After studying proofreading, she worked as a copyeditor at the magazine Sudestada, and later as a writer. An interest in countering what she perceived as harmful gender roles in children's literature led Fink to cofound the independent publisher Chirimbote and create the Anti-Princess Series in 2015. The series and its two companions the Anti-Hero Series and League of Anti-Princesses are distributed throughout Latin America and have been translated into several languages. Fink has also written other books for children and coedited volumes for adults about gender and feminism, including an edition inspired by and responding to the Ni una menos movement." ;

Powell, originally from Berrigan, was used up forward and on the half back flanks while at Richmond. He kicked 17 goals in 1989 and early the following season had two 'Best on ground' performances which were later awarded acknowledged in the Brownlow Medal count. Before the 1993 season he was traded to Carlton for pick 28 in the draft and in his first year at his new club lined on the half forward flank in their 1993 Grand Final loss to Essendon." ;

The goalscoring inside right midfielder, who won the first Bundesliga trophy with 1. FC Köln in 1964, played just one of his three internationals for West Germany outside a FIFA World Cup. Therefore, he was part at the 1958 FIFA World Cup and at the 1962 FIFA World Cup, playing one match on each occasion. With 1. FC Köln, Sturm also won the West German football championship in 1962. His son Ralf (born 18 October 1968) was a striker for 1. FC Köln in the Bundesliga himself, netting 28 goals in 121 games as a striker in between 1988 and 1994." ;

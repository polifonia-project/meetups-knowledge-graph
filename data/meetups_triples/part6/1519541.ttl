        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roger Caleb Rogerson (born 3 January 1941) is a former detective sergeant of the New South Wales Police Force, and a convicted murderer.During Rogerson's career, he was one of the most decorated officers in the police force, having received at least thirteen awards for bravery, outstanding policemanship and devotion to duty including the Peter Mitchell Trophy, the highest annual police award. During his time in office he was implicated in—but never convicted of—two killings, bribery, assault and drug dealing. In 1999, Rogerson was convicted of perverting the course of justice and lying to the Police Integrity Commission. He is also known for his association with other New South Wales (NSW) detectives who are reputed to have been corrupt, including Ray \"Gunner\" Kelly and Fred Krahe, and with a number of organised crime figures, including Abe Saffron, Arthur \"Neddy\" Smith and Christopher Dale Flannery. Smith was a convicted heroin dealer, rapist and armed robber who claimed Rogerson gave him the \"green light\" to commit crimes in NSW, while Flannery specialised in contract killing. In May 2014, Rogerson was remanded in prison after being charged, along with fellow former NSW detective Glen McNamara, with the murder of 20-year-old student Jamie Gao, and supply of drugs. Both pleaded not guilty in January 2015. Their trial was started in July 2015, but was aborted after two days because of the potential prejudice caused after McNamara's then-barrister Charles Waterstreet made a reference to Rogerson \"killing two or three people when he was in the police force\". Following a retrial, both Rogerson and McNamara were found guilty of murder. In September 2016, both were sentenced to jail for life for the murder of Gao." ;

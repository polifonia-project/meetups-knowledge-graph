        mtp:hasAbstract        "Benjamin Charles Stephenson or B. C. Stephenson (1839 â€“ 22 January 1906) was an English dramatist, lyricist and librettist. After beginning a career in the civil service, he started to write for the theatre, using the pen name \"Bolton Rowe\". He was author or co-author of several long-running shows of the Victorian theatre. His biggest hit was the comic opera Dorothy, which set records for the length of its original run. His writing collaborators included Clement Scott and Brandon Thomas, and composers with whom he worked included Frederic Clay, Alfred Cellier and Arthur Sullivan with whom he wrote The Zoo, which continues to be revived today." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Betty Thompson (1934â€“1994) was a Canadian television presenter who spent most of her career at CKCO-TV in Kitchener, Ontario. She was seen throughout Canada as host of CTV's version of Romper Room, a children's programme produced at CKCO's studios. She was born in Walkerton, Ontario, raised in Peterborough, Ontario and studied broadcasting at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute. She was married twice and had three daughters, Susan, Patricia and Judith. The annual Betty Thompson Golf Classic began in 1992 as a financial support for breast cancer education and research. She would die from this disease in 1994, four years after diagnosis. During her lifetime, Thompson would contribute to many charitable and community causes, particularly in Kitchener and its region. The causes included Oktoberfest and Big Sisters. During the four years she suffered from cancer, she openly discussed her disease, and was an advocate for its treatment. The Betty Thompson Youth Centre, which opened in 1996 and has been run by Lutherwood since late 2000, is named after her." ;

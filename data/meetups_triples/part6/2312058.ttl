        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Fraser (11 April 1930 â€“ 13 March 1997) was a British character actor, who appeared in numerous British plays, films and television shows from the 1950s to the 1990s. An unusual appearance and unique delivery made him a natural comedic actor. Fraser was a familiar figure in West End clubs during the sixties, and despite a long-standing reputation as one of the hardest drinking of British actors he was still working in his last years. He was perhaps best known as Basil \"Badger\" Allenby-Johnson in the 1970s television series The Misfit." ;

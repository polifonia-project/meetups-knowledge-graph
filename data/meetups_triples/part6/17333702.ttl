        mtp:hasAbstract        "Henry Lau (simplified Chinese: 刘宪华; traditional Chinese: 劉憲華; Korean: 헨리; born October 11, 1989), often mononymously referred to as Henry, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor based in South Korea and China. He debuted in 2008 as a member of Super Junior-M and launched his solo career in 2013 with Trap. His original soundtrack \"It's You\" released in 2017 became the most streamed Korean OST on Spotify for two consecutive years in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, Henry left SM Entertainment following the expiration of his contract, and subsequently joined Monster Entertainment Group. Henry made his Hollywood debut in 2019 with the film A Dog's Journey produced by Amblin Entertainment. In 2020, he starred in the action-fantasy movie Double World. The film was released on Netflix and the Chinese streaming service iQIYI, becoming the first movie produced in Mainland China to have a simultaneous global release. Henry is also known for his television work in the programs Real Man and I Live Alone, for which he received the Best Newcomer Award (2014) and Excellence Male Award (2017) respectively at the MBC Entertainment Awards." ;

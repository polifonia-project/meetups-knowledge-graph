        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kathleen Emperatriz DeLuna (born November 26, 1987) is an American singer. DeLuna began pursuing a career as a singer when she was a teenager and later signed with Epic Records. Her debut single, \"Whine Up\", released in 2007, went on to become a commercial success, entering the Top 40 in numerous countries and topping the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. Her debut studio album, 9 Lives (2007), failed to see the success of its lead single. The album's third single, \"Run the Show\", became a hit in various territories, and reached number two on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Following the commercial performance of her first album, DeLuna was dropped from Epic Records. DeLuna continued to record both collaborations and soundtrack singles. DeLuna later began working on her second studio album, Inside Out (2010), which received a limited release through Universal Music Belgium. The album spawned a number of singles, notably \"Party O'Clock\", \"Unstoppable\", \"Push Push\", and \"Dancing Tonight\" featuring Lil Wayne, Akon, and Fo Onassis respectively. Viva, the North American edition of the album, was slated to be released later that year; however, this never materialized. DeLuna released the compilation album \"Loading\" in 2016. Wanna See U Dance was released as the first single back in 2012. DeLuna is currently working on her fourth studio album. In 2007, DeLuna won \"Best New Artist\" at the Los Premios MTV Latinoam√©rica 2007 awards. In 2008, she won \"Best New Artist\" and \"Best Urban Artist\" at the TMF Awards. DeLuna's single, \"Whine Up\", won the award for \"Latin Dance Club Play Track of the Year\" at the 2008 Latin Billboard Music Awards. She also won a Casandra Award in 2008 for \"Best International Artist\"." ;

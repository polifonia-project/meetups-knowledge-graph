He also has done solo work like the song \"Maybe Love\" on the Jetsons: The Movie soundtrack, as well as \"Edge of a Dream\", the soundtrack to the movie Space Mutiny, which was memorably lambasted by the cast of Mystery Science Theater 3000, the song was likewise mocked when it appeared in the closing credits, with the 'bots (Tom Servo and Crow T.

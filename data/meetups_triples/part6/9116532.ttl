He performs blues and roots music, particularly in a Delta blues style. He is a bass-baritone. Theessink has released 20 albums, a songbook, a blues-guitar instruction video and a DVD. In 2012, he released Delta Time (2012), performed with Terry Evans and featuring Ry Cooder. In 2013, he released Wishing Well, which he described as a retrospective album looking back at many of his favorite moments in his music career. The album also features several originals, including \"House Up On The Hill,\" which he described as a song about flooding in Mississippi. Hans has said he was partly inspired by observing floods in his home country of The Netherlands during his childhood." ;

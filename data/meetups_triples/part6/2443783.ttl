        mtp:hasAbstract        "Leroy Halirou Bohari Lita (born 28 December 1984) is an English professional footballer who plays for Southern League Premier Division Central club Hednesford Town. Lita was a product of the Chelsea youth system but never made a first-team appearance for the club; in 2002, he moved to Bristol City and later represented Reading, where his form helped him earn a place with the England under-21 side. He later played for Middlesbrough, Swansea City, Barnsley, Yeovil Town, in Greece for AO Chania and in Thailand for Sisaket, with loan spells at Charlton Athletic, Norwich City, Birmingham City, Sheffield Wednesday, Brighton & Hove Albion and Notts County. He then moved into non-league football." ;

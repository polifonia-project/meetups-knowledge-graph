        mtp:hasAbstract        "Karna Das (Nepali: कर्ण दास) (born 24 November 1974 in Pokhara, Nepal), is a Nepali musician, singer, songwriter, lyricist, composer, and record producer. Das is regarded as the \"living legend\" of the Nepali music landscape. He is revered for his soothing and melodious timbre and also for his distinct songwriting attributed with immense depth and earnestness. His lyrics spans topics such as philosophical and existential issues of mankind, perseverance, overcoming ordeals, lamentation, hope, anti-fatalism, and patriotism. He completed high school in 1993, completed his Intermediate of Arts (IA) in Education, and studied economics in college. Das was the lead vocalist of the band Madhyanha (\"Central Point\"). He began his singing career in 1997 with the band's first song, \"Jindagi Ko Ke Bharosa\". Drawing inspiration from the Indian poet Nida Fazli, from his poem \"Jindagi Kya Hai Chalta Firta\", Das had drafted the song when he was studying in grade 9. He furnished his own composition and vocals into the song and refined it after incorporating constructive feedback from his mother. The band released the song in its final form when Das was 20. \"Jindagi Ko Ke Bharosa\", became an instant cult classic among the Nepalese populace and continues to be cherished hitherto. Das recalls in his church congregation in Pokhara, he would explain the crux of his song, that our life lived out on purely materialistic grounds is fragile and limited. The implication, therefore, he points, is to make life count by seeking what is lasting and deviating from immorality. Das plays piano, guitar, and bass guitar. His musical inspirations include Elton John, Richard Marx, Scorpions, Michael Jackson, Gulam Ali of Pakistan, Lata Mangeshkar and the Ghazal singer Jagjit Singh of India, and Narayan Gopal of Nepal. Das makes rare appearances in commercial and popular media." ;

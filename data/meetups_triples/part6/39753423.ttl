        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexander Gustav von Schrenk (4 February 1816 – 25 June 1876) was a Russian naturalist born near Tula in what was then the Russian Empire. He was a brother to zoologist Leopold von Schrenck (1826–1894). From 1834 to 1837, he studied sciences at the University of Dorpat (Tartu), later spending several years as an assistant at the botanical garden in St. Petersburg. He was habilitated for mineralogy at Dorpat, where from 1849 he served as a lecturer. From 1858 he spent the next ten years at his wife's manor in Pühajärve (Heiligensee), Livonia, returning to Dorpat in 1868, where he died several years later. Known for his expeditions to Central Asia and northern Russia, he was the author of Reise nach dem Nordosten des europäischen Rußlands, durch die Tundren der Samojeden, zum arktischen Uralgebirge, a two-volume work involving a journey to the Arctic that was later translated into English. While traveling in the historic region of Dzhungaria in Central Asia, he identified numerous new species of plants and insects. Schrenk was co-founder of the Dorpater Naturforschergesellschaft (Tartu Naturalists' Society). The species Picea schrenkiana (Schrenk's spruce), in 1841, and Tulipa schrenkii (Schrenck's tulip) are named in his honor. Also in 1841, botanists Fisch. and C.A.Mey. published Schrenkia, which is a genus of flowering plants from Central Asia belonging to the family Apiaceae and named in his honour." ;

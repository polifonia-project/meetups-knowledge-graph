        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jason Tanamor (born April 25, 1975) is a Filipino-American author, writer, and entertainment interviewer. His novels range in genre, from dark in nature to satirical and from young adult to children's. His novel, a NA urban fantasy about Filipino folklore (aswang) called Vampires of Portlandia, touches upon his love for campy horror stories. \"It’s not really a fascination but I do love the genre, but mixed with dark humor or comedy, which includes the shows 'Supernatural' and 'Grimm', and the movies 'The Lost Boys' and 'Beetlejuice'. The new novel is a mashup of these shows and movies.\" It was recently optioned for screen and is currently in development. Tanamor's newest effort, a YA titled Love, Dance & Egg Rolls is set in Portland during the Trump Administration and follows high school sophomore, Jamie, whose sole purpose in life is to become the next Tinikling master. (Tinikling is the national dance of the Philippines.) On May 10, 2022, the day it debuted, Powell's Books picked it as a \"Pick of the Month.\" His two novels, Anonymous and Drama Dolls, have received critical acclaim from major publications such as Publishers Weekly – who called him a \"promising writer with lots of potential\" and compared him to Chuck Palahniuk and Charles Bukowski – and . He and his books have been featured in many publications such as Library Journal, Publishers Weekly, Yahoo!, Esquire (Philippines), CNN Philippines, Daily Inquirer (Philippines), and Daily Tribune (Philippines). Tanamor also is ranked in the Favorite Filipino and Filipino-American Author poll at Ranker. He was named as one of the \"5 Best Modern Filipino Writers\" by Pinas magazine." ;

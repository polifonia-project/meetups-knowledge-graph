        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gennadiy Gennadyevich Golovkin (Cyrillic: Генна́дий Генна́дьевич Голо́вкин; also spelled Gennady; born 8 April 1982), often known by his nickname \"GGG\" or \"Triple G\", is a Kazakhstani professional boxer. He has held multiple middleweight world championships, and is a two-time unified champion, having held the IBF title since 2019 and the WBA (Super) title since April 2022. Previously he held the unified WBA (Super), WBC and IBF titles between 2014 and 2018, and has challenged once for the undisputed super middleweight championship in 2022. He is also a two-time IBO middleweight champion, in his second reign since 2019. Golovkin was ranked as the world's best boxer, pound for pound, from September 2017 to September 2018 by The Ring magazine. As of August 2022, he is ranked as the world's third best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec, and tenth by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board (TBRB). He is also ranked as the world's best active middleweight by BoxRec, The Ring, and TBRB, and second by ESPN. In 2010, Golovkin won the WBA interim middleweight title by defeating Milton Núñez. The WBA elevated him to Regular champion status in the same year. He won the IBO title the following year. In 2014, Golovkin was elevated to the status of WBA (Super) champion and successfully defended both his titles against Daniel Geale. Later that year he defeated Marco Antonio Rubio to win WBC interim middleweight title, and defeated David Lemieux for the IBF middleweight title in 2015. After Canelo Álvarez vacated his WBC middleweight title in 2016, Golovkin was elevated to full champion and held three of the four major world titles in boxing. Golovkin lost all his titles, including his undefeated record, following a loss to Álvarez in 2018. He regained his IBF and IBO titles by defeating Sergiy Derevyanchenko in 2019, and regained his WBA (Super) title by defeating Ryōta Murata in 2022. A calculating pressure fighter, Golovkin is known for his exceptionally powerful and precise punching, balance, and methodical movement inside the ring. With a streak of 23 knockouts that spanned from 2008 to 2017, he holds the highest knockout-to-win ratio – 89.7% – in middleweight championship history. Golovkin is also said to have one of the most durable chins in boxing history, having never been knocked down or otherwise stopped in a total of 395 fights, 45 as a professional and 350 as an amateur. In his amateur career, Golovkin won a gold medal in the middleweight division at the 2003 World Championships. He went on to represent Kazakhstan at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning a middleweight silver medal." ;

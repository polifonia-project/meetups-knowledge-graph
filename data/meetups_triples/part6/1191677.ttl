        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Shankaracharya (born Subramanyam Mahadeva; 18 July 1935 – 28 February 2018) was the 69th Shankaracharya Guru and head or pontiff (Pïțhādhipati) of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham. Subramanyam Mahadeva Iyer was nominated by his predecessor, Chandrashekarendra Saraswati, as his successor and was given the pontifical title Sri Jayendra Saraswathi on 22 March 1954. Sri Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal succeeded Mahaperiyava Chandrashekara Saraswati Swamigal in 1960, a fact not many people know. He conducted all the activities of the mutt with the oversight of his Guru out of reverence. His successor was anointed by the then Senior Pontiff Mahaperiyava during his lifetime in the early 1980s." ;

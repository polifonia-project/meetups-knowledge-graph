        mtp:hasAbstract        "Khalid Abdul Muhammad (born Harold Moore Jr.; January 12, 1948 â€“ February 17, 2001) was an African-American Muslim minister and activist who became a prominent figure in the Nation of Islam and later the New Black Panther Party. After a racially inflammatory 1993 speech at Kean College, Muhammad was condemned and removed from his position in the Nation of Islam by Louis Farrakhan. He was also censured by both Houses of the United States Congress. After being removed from the Nation of Islam, he served as the National Chairman of the New Black Panther Party until his death in 2001 from a brain aneurysm. He advocated black independence and stated a personal practice of anti-miscegenation." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roger Eugene Ailes (May 15, 1940 â€“ May 18, 2017) was an American television executive and media consultant. He was the chairman and CEO of Fox News, Fox Television Stations and 20th Television. Ailes was a media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, and for Rudy Giuliani's 1989 New York City mayoral election. In July 2016, he resigned from Fox News after being accused of sexual harassment by several female Fox employees, including on-air hosts Gretchen Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Andrea Tantaros. Ailes had hemophilia, a medical condition in which the body is impaired in its ability to produce blood clots. He died on May 18, 2017, at the age of 77 after a subdural hematoma that was aggravated by his hemophilia." ;

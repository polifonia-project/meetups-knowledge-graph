        mtp:hasAbstract        "Garfield Akers (possibly born James Garfield Echols, probably 1908 â€“ c. 1959) was an American blues singer and guitarist. He had sometimes performed under the pseudonym \"Garfield Partee.\" Info on him is uncertain, and knowledge of his life is based almost entirely on reports of a few contemporary witnesses. Akers' extant recordings consist of four sides, which are nonetheless historically significant. His most well-known song was his debut single \"Cottonfield Blues\", a duet with friend and longtime collaborator Joe Callicott on second guitar, based on a song performed by Texas blues musician Henry Thomas a few years earlier." ;

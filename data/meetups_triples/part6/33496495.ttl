        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Bernard Rabb (January 2, 1930 in Charleston, South Carolina â€“ July 27, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois) was an American zoologist, and the former director of the Brookfield Zoo from 1976 until 2003. Rabb's pioneering work led the zoo toward its current position as a conservation center, a concept Rabb has championed for zoos everywhere. He joined Brookfield Zoo in 1956 as curator of research. Rabb created the zoo's Education Department and was instrumental in the use of naturalistic exhibitry to provide visitors with environmental immersion experiences throughout the zoo. Dr. Rabb had affiliations with conservation associations worldwide and is a respected spokesman on wildlife conservation issues. He won the 1996 , 1997 Silver Medal (Zoological Society of London), and 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award (National Conference on Science, Policy and the Environment)." ;

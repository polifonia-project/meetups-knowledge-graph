        mtp:hasAbstract        "Danniella Westbrook (born 5 November 1973) is an English actress, best known for originally playing Sam Mitchell in the BBC soap opera EastEnders on and off from 1990 to 2000 and 2009 to 2016. Away from EastEnders, she has presented various series, and was also a contestant on the ITV contest I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003. Westbrook competed in the 2010 series of Dancing on Ice, with US Pairs Skater Matthew Gonzalez, and finished fourth in the competition. In 2013, she appeared in Hollyoaks as Trudy Ryan. In 2016, she took part in the seventeenth series of Celebrity Big Brother, where she reached the final and finished in fifth place. On 27 February of that same year, it was confirmed that Westbrook would return to EastEnders, very briefly with on-screen brother Grant (played by Ross Kemp), for the death of their on-screen mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor). On 13 October 2022, it was announced that Westbrook would play \"The Fairy Godmother\" in a West End adult pantomime of Sinderfella. The production will run from 9-22 December 2022 in The Prince of Wales Theatre, Drury Lane. Westbrook had a much publicised cocaine addiction throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, which caused the complete erosion of her nasal septum. She sought treatment, but later relapsed. She was previously married and has two children. She has also released two autobiographies, The Other Side of Nowhere in 2006, and, Faith, Hope and Clarity in 2013." ;

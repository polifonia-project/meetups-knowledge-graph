        mtp:hasAbstract        "Pedro Carlos Soto de la Colina (23 October 1934, San Luis, Cañete, Peru – 19 July 2004, Lima, Peru), popularly known as Caitro Soto, was an Afro-Peruvian musician and composer. He was known for his version of the Peruvian folk song, \"Toro Mata\" and as part of the Afro-Peruvian artist's collective Peru Negro. Peru Negro, located in Lima, is one of the most important organizations dedicated to preserving Afro-Peruvian music, dance and culture. Soto appeared in The Motorcycle Diaries as \"Papá Carlito\", a resident of the leper colony at San Pablo, Peru. There is a book by Caitro Soto written in Spanish with an accompanying compact disc entitled De Cajón: Caitro Soto – el duende en la música Afroperuana, published by el Comercio in Lima, Peru, in 1995." ;

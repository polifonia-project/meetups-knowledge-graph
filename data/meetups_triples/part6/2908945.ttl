        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zaid Abdul-Aziz (born Donald A. Smith on April 7, 1946) is an American former professional basketball player. Donald Smith changed his name to Zaid Abdul-Aziz in 1976 after he converted to Islam. The 6'9\" Abdul-Aziz starred at Iowa State University before being drafted by the NBA's Cincinnati Royals in 1968. He played ten seasons in the league as a member of the Royals, Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle SuperSonics, Houston Rockets, Buffalo Braves, and Boston Celtics. Nicknamed \"The Kangaroo\", he had perhaps his finest season in 1971â€“1972, when he averaged 13.8 points and 11.3 rebounds for Seattle. He retired in 1978 with career totals of 4,557 points and 4,065 rebounds. In 2006, Zaid Abdul-Aziz published a memoir, Darkness to Sunlight, which tells the stories of his basketball career, personal challenges, and spiritual journey. Abdul-Aziz is now a drug and alcohol counselor in Seattle." ;

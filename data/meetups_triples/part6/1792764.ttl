        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mitchell Joseph Landrieu (/ˈlændruː/ LAN-drew; born August 16, 1960) is an American lawyer and politician who served as Mayor of New Orleans from 2010 to 2018. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana from 2004 to 2010. Landrieu is the son of former New Orleans Mayor and Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Moon Landrieu and the brother of former U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu. In 2007, he won a second term as lieutenant governor in the October 20, 2007 nonpartisan blanket primary by defeating two Republicans: State Representative Gary J. Beard and singer Sammy Kershaw. He was elected Mayor of New Orleans on February 6, 2010, garnering 66 percent of the citywide vote and claiming victory in 365 of the city's 366 voting precincts. He was reelected mayor on February 1, 2014, with nearly 64 percent of the vote in a three-candidate field and became the first Mayor to win both elections without a runoff and to be elected by majorities of both white and black voters. On November 14, 2021, President Joe Biden announced that Landrieu would serve as Senior Advisor responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. He assumed office with the signing of the bill into law on November 15, 2021." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter Best is an Australian composer who has created or contributed to many film scores. His career started in 1967. In 1969, the founders of Producers Authors Composers and Talent (now PACT Centre for Emerging Artists) attended a Sydney University Architecture Revue, with sets by Geoffrey Atherden and Grahame Bond, and invited Bond, Atherden, Best's friend Peter Weir, and Best a chance to do a show at the National Art School. Sir Robert Helpmann saw the show and took it to the Adelaide Festival, and soon afterwards Weir and Best were commissioned to write a Christmas special TV show for ABC Television, called Man on a Green Bike. He has worked on such films as The Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972), Barry McKenzie Holds His Own (1974), End Play (1976), The Picture Show Man (1977), We of the Never Never (1982), Goodbye Paradise (1983), Bliss (1985), Crocodile Dundee (1986), Crocodile Dundee II (1988), Muriel's Wedding (1994), Doing Time for Patsy Cline (1997) and My Mother Frank (2000). Many of his scores have been released on compact disc, including Crocodile Dundee on Var√®se Sarabande, and We of the Never Never on 1M1 Records. He was also responsible for the theme music for the Life. Be in it, Care For Kids (International Year of the Child 1979), Slip Slop Slap (Cancer Council Victoria), and Rosella (Only the Best to You)." ;

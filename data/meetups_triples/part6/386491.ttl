Fraser is known for his leading roles in blockbusters, comedies, and dramatic films. He gained prominence for his role as Rick O'Connell in The Mummy trilogy (1999–2008).

In 2018, Fraser said that he had been sexually assaulted by Philip Berk, the then-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), in 2003. The alleged assault, his subsequent divorce, the death of his mother, and health problems led to a pause in his career.

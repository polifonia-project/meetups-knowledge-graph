        mtp:hasAbstract        "Skinnyman (born Alexander Graham Holland, 9 November 1974) is a British rapper who was born in Chapeltown Leeds, Yorkshire and moved to Finsbury Park, London at a young age. He grew up on the Six Acres Estate next to Andover Estate. Among his friends was fellow Leeds-born, London-raised Cornwall DJ Pat Mckay. He formed the Mud Family with Mongo and Chester P, a group which released a number of EPs. These included such records as \"Itchy Town\" and \"Lash Suttin\", a reworking of Redman's \"Smash Something\". Later Supar Novar, Mr. Ti2bs, Uncle Festa and more joined the group. Skinnyman released a solo album, Council Estate of Mind in 2004. He appeared in the first episode of Tower Block Dreams, a 2004 documentary series on BBC Three which looked into the underground music scene in council estates. He also played a small part in the 2005 interactive TV series Dubplate Drama." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jordin John Kudluk Tootoo MSM (Inuktitut: ᔪᐊᑕᓐ ᑐᑐ; born February 2, 1983) is a Canadian former professional hockey player, who played for the Nashville Predators, Detroit Red Wings, New Jersey Devils and Chicago Blackhawks. Of Inuit, Ukrainian and English descent, he is the first Inuk player to play in the NHL. Tootoo was widely regarded as one of the NHL's best agitators and was able to annoy, fight, and outplay other players to help his team win. At the end of the 2016–17 NHL season, Tootoo had accumulated 65 goals, 96 assists and 1010 PIMs in 723 career NHL games since entering the league in 2003. In addition to his on-ice skills, Tootoo is known for his charity and community outreach work, especially in northern communities. On October 19, 2018, he officially announced his retirement on Twitter, saying \"After 220 regular-season games with the Wheat Kings and 723 games in the NHL I have decided to retire from the NHL to focus on giving back to the Indigenous community.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Scott \"Jack\" Elam (November 13, 1920 â€“ October 20, 2003) was an American film and television actor best known for his numerous roles as villains in Western films and, later in his career, comedies (sometimes spoofing his villainous image). His most distinguishing physical quality was his misaligned eye. Before his career in acting, he took several jobs in finance and served two years in the United States Navy during World War II. Elam performed in 73 movies and in at least 41 television series." ;

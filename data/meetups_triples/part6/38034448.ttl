        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chase Vincent Malone (born May 25, 1987), more commonly known as Cha Cha Malone, is an American singer, music producer, songwriter, composer, and member of b-boy crew Art of Movement (AOM), from Seattle, Washington. Malone is widely known for his work with Korean-American singer, friend, and fellow AOMG member, Jay Park, which began in 2010 with online hits \"Bestie\" and \"Speechless\", and has produced nine tracks for his multi-platinum and award-winning works, Take A Deeper Look and New Breed. In 2011, Malone released an EP, Breakthrough, through iTunes and Bandcamp. Aside from collaborations with Park, Malone has produced and worked with many other artists in South Korea, including Red Velvet, Loona, Cho Seungyoun, Shinhwa, Kara, Dok2, The Quiett, Beenzino, U-KISS, NU'EST, One, B1A4, Baekhyun, and Onew. Malone's distinctive producer tag, the phrase 'I need a cha cha beat boy', is heavily associated with Jay Park's music." ;

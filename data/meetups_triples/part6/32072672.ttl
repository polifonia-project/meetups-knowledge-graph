        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rebecca Foon (born 13 December 1978) is a Canadian cellist, vocalist, and composer from Montreal, Quebec. Foon currently records under her own name, as well as the alias Saltland, and is a member and co-founder of the Juno Award-winning modern chamber ensemble Esmerine. She has also been a member of several groups associated with the post rock, experimental, and chamber music scenes of Montreal and New York City, including Set Fire to Flames, A Silver Mt. Zion, and Colin Stetsonâ€™s Gorecki Symphony of Sorrow ensemble. Esmerine's Turkish folk influenced album Dalmak, released in 2013, was awarded the Juno Award for Instrumental Album of the Year in 2014. In 2013, she released her first Saltland album, which Exclaim.ca called \"a captivating combination of genres from dream pop to chamber music to ambient and shoegaze.\" In 2020, Foon released Waxing Moon, her first album under her own name, which received international acclaim. Foon has also composed many soundtracks for film and museums. Foon is an environmental activist and co-founder, with Jesse Paris Smith, of Pathway to Paris and the 1000 Cities Initiative for Carbon Freedom, dedicated to turning the Paris Agreement into reality." ;

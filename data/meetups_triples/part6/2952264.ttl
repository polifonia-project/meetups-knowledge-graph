He was best known as Elvis Presley's personal physician and was controversial due to the singer's longstanding abuse of prescription drugs. Although Nichopoulos retained his medical license after Presley’s death, the Tennessee Medical Board eventually permanently revoked Nichopoulos’s license in light of his practice of overprescribing to many patients over multiple years." ;

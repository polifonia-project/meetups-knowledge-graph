He was the son of Sir William John Clarke. Sir William was made a baronet by Queen Victoria for the huge sums he had given to various causes. Succeeding to the baronetcy on his father's death in May 1897, Rupert followed him into the Legislative Council of Victoria as member for Southern Province, retaining the seat until 1904. Sir Rupert married Elsie Tucker, with whom he had a son, also Rupert, who would inherit the title." ;

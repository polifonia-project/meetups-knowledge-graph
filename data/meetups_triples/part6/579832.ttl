        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Charles Cole Claiborne (c. 1773–1775 – November 23, 1817) was an American politician, best known as the first non-colonial governor of Louisiana. He also has the distinction of possibly being the youngest member of the United States Congress in U.S. history, although reliable sources differ about his age. Claiborne supervised the transfer of Louisiana to U.S. control after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, governing the \"Territory of Orleans\" from 1804 to 1812, the year in which Louisiana became a state. He won the first election for Louisiana's state Governor and served through 1816, for a total of thirteen years as Louisiana's executive administrator. New Orleans served as the capital city during both the colonial period and the early statehood period." ;

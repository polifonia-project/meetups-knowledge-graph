        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julian Cochran (born 1974) is an English-born Australian composer. Cochran's earlier works show stylistic influences from Impressionist music and his later works are more noticeably influenced by Classical music and folk music of Eastern Europe. The piano works include twelve preludes, five mazurkas, two scherzi, six Romanian Dances, (comprising Tin Sentinel, Clockwork Doll, Wooden Dolls (Matreshki) and Flydian Galop), (comprising Butterfly Dance, Hedgehog, Goat's Dance and Tail-chasing Kitten), Toccata & Fire Dance, the impressionistic work Maelstrom, four large Fantasia works (Dagda's Harp, Grande Scherzo, the three movement work Sul Settimo, and The Wind Sylph and the Dryad), three waltzes titled Valses, two piano sonatas, a cycle of five works titled Pegasus' Travels and Dances of Noble Sentiment (comprising Minuet, Courante, Rondeau and Forlana). Related to the piano works are seven pieces published for concert harp. Cochran also wrote orchestral and chamber music including the trio for violin, cor anglais and concert harp or piano Artemis, the sextet for string quartet, oboe and bassoon Zorya Vechernyaya, the four-part orchestral work Symphonic Tale, Two Valses for symphony orchestra, the Romanian Dances for chamber orchestra, Dagda's Harp Fantasy for symphony orchestra and choral works. Cochran's music has been performed at Carnegie Hall in New York, the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Berlin Konzerthaus, and the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Hall in Russia. The International Cochran Piano Competition is held in Warsaw, Poland." ;

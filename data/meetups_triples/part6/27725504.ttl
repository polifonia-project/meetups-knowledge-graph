He began his career as a professional rider at Delaware Park in Wilmington, Delaware and in 2001 was his breakout year and he was voted the United States' Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey. In 2005, Rose guided Afleet Alex, to victory in two American Classic Races, the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. His performances that year earned him the ESPY Award as the top American jockey of 2005.

In 2008, Rose was suspended for six months by the Delaware Thoroughbred Racing Commission for whipping in the head during a June 23 race at Delaware Park.

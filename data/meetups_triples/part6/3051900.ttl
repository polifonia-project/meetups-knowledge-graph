        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark Stephen Howard (born 21 September 1986) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Wrexham. Born in Southwark, London, Howard was part of Arsenal's youth team, but having failed to make the step up to the senior squad he departed for Cardiff City. He moved to Scotland, with spells at St Mirren and Aberdeen, before moving back to England to play for Blackpool, Sheffield United (for whom he holds the club's consecutive clean-sheet record of eight games) and Bolton Wanderers. He returned to Blackpool in 2018 and remained there for two years, during which he had a loan spell at Salford City. He has since had spells at Scunthorpe United, Carlisle United and Wrexham." ;

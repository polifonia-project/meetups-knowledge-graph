        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bob Drake (born December 6, 1957) is an American multi-instrumentalist musician and recording engineer. He was a founding member of the avant-rock band Thinking Plague in the early 1980s, and a member of the 5uu's, Hail and The Science Group (with Chris Cutler, and Fred Frith). He formed his own band, Bob Drake's Cabinet of Curiosities in 2007. Drake's engineering credits include mainstream artists like Ice Cube, Tina Turner and Engelbert Humperdinck. Drake has released a number of solo albums, all written, performed and recorded by himself. Fran√ßois Couture at AllMusic described each successive album as \"a more twisted aural journey than the previous one\"." ;

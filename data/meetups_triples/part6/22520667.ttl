Rita Connolly and Ronan Tynan sang the anthem song \"May We Never Have to Say Goodbye\" which topped the Irish charts for two weeks. She has also produced two solo albums, one with the eponymous title Rita Connolly, and the second Valpariso on the Tara Music label. In more recent times she has collaborated again with Davey (who is also her husband) and Co. Kerry based musicians Seamus Begley, Éilís Ní Chinneide, Laurence Courtney, Daithí Ó Sé, and Eoin Begley.

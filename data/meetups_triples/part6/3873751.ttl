        mtp:hasAbstract        "Claude Terrasse (27 January 1867 – 30 June 1923) was a French composer of operettas. Terrasse was born in L'Arbresle, Rhône. He became known by writing the music for the play Ubu Roi by Alfred Jarry in 1896. In Paris, his brother-in-law, the painter Pierre Bonnard, introduced him to the artistic world and the avant-garde literature and art of the time. Bonnard also did several portraits of him. In 1890, Terrasse married Andrée Bonnard, sister of the artist Pierre Bonnard. By 1899, they had six children, several of whom appear in Bonnard paintings. Their son Charles Terrasse published a monograph on Bonnard in 1927. Terrasse died in Paris, and was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alice Mona Best (née Shaw; 3 January 1924 – 9 October 1988) was a British music club proprietor, best known as the owner of The Casbah Coffee Club, a club in Liverpool which served as a venue for rock and roll music during the late 1950s and 1960s. Among the bands to play at The Casbah was the Beatles, for whom her son Pete Best (b. 24 November 1941) was a drummer at the time. Mona also had two other sons, John Rory (b. 29 January 1945), and Vincent \"Roag\" Best (b. 21 July 1962). It was later confirmed that Roag's father was The Beatles' associate, music executive Neil Aspinall, although he was not registered as the father on Roag's birth certificate. After moving to Liverpool from India, where she was born, Mona used gambling winnings to buy a house in 1957. Mona later opened The Casbah Coffee Club in the cellar of the house. It was planned as a members-only club for her sons and their friends. The club was often referred to as The Casbah Club, or The Casbah. In 2006, the property was accorded a Grade II heritage listing. Mona died in October 1988, after a heart attack following a long illness." ;

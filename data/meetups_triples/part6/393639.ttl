He is credited as the founding father and the principal driving force behind the formation of the UAE, uniting seven emirates. He was also the ruler of Abu Dhabi from 1966 until his death. Zayed replaced his older brother Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan as the ruler of Abu Dhabi on 6 August 1966 after Shakhbut was deposed through a bloodless coup by members of the ruling family with British support." ;

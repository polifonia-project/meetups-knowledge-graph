        mtp:hasAbstract        "Natalie Alexis Duncan is a British soul musician from Nottingham, England, currently signed to British music producer and DJ Goldie’s record imprint Fallen Tree 1Hundred. Duncan released her eponymous debut EP Natalie Alexis Duncan under the Farmyard Records label in 2009, shortly after which she was selected as one of a group of young musicians chosen to take part in the BBC Two series Goldie's Band: By Royal Appointment, which was broadcast in March and April 2011. On the back of her appearance on the programme, Duncan was offered a recording contract with Verve Records and began recording her debut album in early 2011, produced by Joe Henry, with the majority of recording sessions taking place at Real World Studios. The lead single from the album \"Sky Is Falling\" was released in March 2012, followed by the album Devil In Me on 16 July 2012. After the release of her Black & White EP in 2015, her second studio album Free was released on 31 July 2020 under Goldie’s Fallen Tree 1Hundred label. Duncan’s style draws on her influences ranging from Nina Simone, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, Grizzly Bear, Aretha Franklin, Radiohead, Elliott Smith, Jeff Buckley, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan. She has been compared to the likes of Alicia Keys, Amy Winehouse, Norah Jones and Nina Simone." ;

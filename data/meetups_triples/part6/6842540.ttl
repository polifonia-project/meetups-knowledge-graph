        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Elhardt Hays (March 14, 1914 â€“ August 26, 1981) was an American folksinger and songwriter, best known for singing bass with the Weavers. Throughout his life, he was concerned with overcoming racism, inequality, and violence in society. He wrote or cowrote \"Wasn't That a Time?\", \"If I Had a Hammer\", and \"Kisses Sweeter than Wine\", which became Weavers' staples. He also familiarized audiences with songs of the 1930s labor movement, such as \"We Shall Not Be Moved\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dimitra Galani (Greek: Δήμητρα Γαλανή) is a Greek singer and songwriter. Galani was born 1952 in Athens and began her musical career at the age of 16 providing vocals on several tracks of Dimos Moutsis and Nikos Gatsos on the album \"A Smile\": (Greek: Ένα Χαμόγελο). She subsequently contributed to Manos Hatzidakis' 1971 album \"Land of Gold\" [gr: 'Της Γης Το Χρυσάφι'], providing vocals on six of the twelve tracks included on the album. In that same year, she released her first eponymous solo album. Galani continues to collaborate with notable Greek composers and performers. In addition to Hatzidakis, Galani has collaborated with composers such as Dimos Moutsis, Manos Loizos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Giannis Spanos, Vassilis Tsitsanis, Mikis Theodorakis and performers such as Alkistis Protopsalti and Xaris Alexiou. Her discography spans both traditional laika and entekhna genres as well as Greek pop and Greek New Wave. In recent years, Galani has composed music both for her own solo work and for feature films and TV, work for which she won the Arion award for the song 'Pull the Trigger' [gr: 'Τράβα σκανδάλη'] and the Prosopa award for the film soundtrack of 'Taxim'." ;

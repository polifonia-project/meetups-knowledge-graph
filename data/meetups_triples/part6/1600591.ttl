        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Grant Moggridge, RDI (25 June 1943 â€“ 8 September 2012) was an English designer, author and educator who cofounded the design company IDEO and was director of the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York. He was a pioneer in adopting a human-centred approach in design, and championed interaction design as a mainstream design discipline (he is given credit for coining the term). Among his achievements, he designed the first laptop computer, the GRiD Compass, was honoured for Lifetime Achievement from the National Design Awards, and given the Prince Philip Designers Prize. He was quoted as saying, \"If there is a simple, easy principle that binds everything I have done together, it is my interest in people and their relationship to things.\"" ;

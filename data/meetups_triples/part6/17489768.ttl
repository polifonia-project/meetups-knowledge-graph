        mtp:hasAbstract        "Timothy Flood (8 January 1927 – 3 July 2014) was an Irish hurler who played as a left corner-forward for the Wexford senior team. Born in Clonroche, County Wexford, Flood first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty two when he first linked up with the Wexford senior team. He made his senior debut in the 1947–48 National Hurling League. Flood went on to win three All-Ireland medals, six Leinster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Flood won two Railway Cup medals in 1954 and 1956. At club level he won three championship medals with Cloughbawn. Flood's career tally of 26 goals and 59 points marks him out as Wexford's fourth highest championship scorer of all-time. Throughout his inter-county career, Flood made 38 championship appearances for Wexford. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1962 championship. His brother-in-law, Oliver \"Hopper\" McGrath, and his son, , also enjoyed All-Ireland success with Wexford. In retirement from playing Flood became involved in team management and coaching. He served as coach of the Cloughbawn junior hurling team before later serving as a selector. Flood is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers of his era and has been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at left corner-forward on a specially-chosen greatest ever Wexford side in 2002." ;

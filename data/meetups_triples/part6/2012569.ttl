        mtp:hasAbstract        "Timothy Blair (January 3, 1967 â€“ February 14, 2013), better known by his stage name Tim Dog, was an American rapper from the Bronx, New York, who rose to notoriety during the early 1990s with his debut LP Penicillin on Wax and the celebrated diss track \"Fuck Compton\". Tim had already appeared on songs with the Ultramagnetic MCs and went on to form a duo, Ultra, with member Kool Keith. \"Fuck Compton\" appeared in XXL magazine's \"Top 25 Diss Tracks of All Time\" and earned Tim Dog critical acclaim from progressive hip-hop producer Blockhead, who said Tim Dog's \"The Dog's Gonna Getcha\" (off Penicillin on Wax) is \"quite possibly the hardest song ever made.\"Nas references Tim Dog on his track \"Where Are They Now?\" from his 2006 album Hip Hop Is Dead, and despite Tim Dog's feud with Dr. Dre, Eminem (whom Dre had discovered) name-checked him on the track \"Ricky Ticky Toc\". On February 14, 2013, the media reported that Tim Dog died of complications from diabetes. By May 2013, he was under investigation for allegedly faking his death to avoid charges of grand larceny, and a warrant was issued in Mississippi for his arrest. However, on September 15, 2014, it was finally confirmed by NBC News that Tim Dog had indeed died on February 14, 2013, as had been initially reported, but then disputed. A death certificate was filed in DeKalb County, Georgia, putting an end to speculation that he was still alive and trying to avoid his court-mandated debts." ;

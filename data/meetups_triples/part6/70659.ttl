        mtp:hasAbstract        "Karl Fredrik Lukas Moodysson (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈlʉ̌ːkas ˈmɔ̂dːʏˌsɔn]; born 17 January 1969) is a Swedish novelist, short story writer and film director. First coming to prominence as an ambitious poet in the 1980s, he had his big domestic and international breakthrough directing the 1998 romantic film Show Me Love. He has since directed a string of films with different styles and public appeal, as well as continued to write both poetry and novels. In 2007, The Guardian ranked Moodysson eleventh in its list of the world’s best directors, describing his directorial style as “heartfelt and uncompromising.”" ;

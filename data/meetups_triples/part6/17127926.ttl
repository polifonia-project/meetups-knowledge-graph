        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chad Jonathon Jones (born 15 June 1984) is an Australian rules footballer currently listed with the Claremont Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), having previously played for the Kangaroos and the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League (AFL). From Perth, Western Australia, Jones made his debut for Claremont in 2003, and was recruited to the Kangaroos in the 2003 National Draft. Over three seasons at the club, he played six games, kicking a single goal, before being traded to West Coast prior to the 2007 season. At West Coast, Jones played seven games over two seasons before being delisted. Remaining with Claremont where he played as a key forward, Jones led the club's goalkicking in 2009 and 2010, also winning the Bernie Naylor Medal as the competition's leading goalkicker in both seasons. He went on to play in Claremont's 2011 and 2012 premiership sides, having also represented Western Australia in two interstate matches." ;

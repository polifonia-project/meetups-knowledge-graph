        mtp:hasAbstract        "Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein (8 February 1819 â€“ 9 March 1887) was a Polish noblewoman (szlachcianka) who is best known for her 40-year relationship with musician Franz Liszt. She was also an amateur journalist and essayist. It is conjectured that she did much of the actual writing of several of Liszt's publications, especially his 1852 Life of Chopin. She maintained an enormous correspondence with Liszt and many others, which is of vital historical interest. She admired and encouraged Hector Berlioz, as is clear from their extensive correspondence, and Berlioz dedicated his Les Troyens to her." ;

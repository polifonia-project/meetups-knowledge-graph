        mtp:hasAbstract        "Corey R. Lewandowski (/ˌluːənˈdaʊski/; born September 18, 1973) is an American political operative, lobbyist, political commentator and author who is politically associated primarily with Donald Trump. He was the first campaign manager of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and fired by Trump during the Republican Primary. He later became a political commentator for One America News Network (OANN), Fox News and CNN. Before convincing Trump he could lead his campaign, Lewandowski worked on several campaigns, for a Congressman, worked for the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and was a lobbyist. On April 30, 1999, Lewandowski tried to carry a bag of laundry into work with a handgun at the bottom of the bag. He was attempting to bring it into his place of work at the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill. He also held the position of Seasonal Marine Patrol Officer Trainee for approximately 3.5 years and successfully graduated the New Hampshire part-time Police Officer Academy. Lewandowski himself has run unsuccessfully for office twice, once in Massachusetts and once in New Hampshire. On December 21, 2016, Lewandowski co-founded Avenue Strategies, a lobbying firm in an office near the White House. He left the firm in May 2017. On August 1, 2019, Lewandowski announced that he was \"very seriously\" considering seeking the Republican nomination to oppose incumbent Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen in the 2020 United States Senate election in New Hampshire. In January 2020, he ultimately decided not to run, while stating that he \"would have won\" had he run. On the day it was reported in September 2021 that he had made sexual advances toward a major Trump donor, a Trump spokesman said Lewandowski \"will no longer be associated with Trump World.\"" ;

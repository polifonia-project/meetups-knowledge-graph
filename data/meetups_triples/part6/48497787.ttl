As a teenager, she became interested in composing film music and won a scholarship to Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she became more involved with jazz and improvisation. After graduation, she moved to Copenhagen to start her career as a pianist and composer. Her compositions are inspired by elements from classical music, jazz, music from the Far East and the Nordic moods." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Trevor Andrew Bauer (born January 17, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Cleveland Indians, and Cincinnati Reds. After starring as a pitcher for three seasons at William S. Hart High School, Bauer graduated a year early and enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles. He and fellow ace Gerrit Cole helped take UCLA to a 22-game winning streak and a College World Series appearance as sophomores in 2010. The following year, Bauer won both the Golden Spikes Award and the National Pitcher of the Year Award. The Diamondbacks selected him third overall at the 2011 MLB Draft. Bauer made his major league debut the following June, becoming the first member of his draft class to reach the majors. Bauer clashed with his Diamondbacks teammates during the 2012 season. In December 2012, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians. He spent the first two seasons there retooling his pitching approach, repairing poor mechanics that he had picked up after a 2012 injury. By 2016, he had emerged as a regular force in the Indians' starting rotation, but shortly after his first MLB All-Star Game appearance in 2018, Bauer's career trajectory was interrupted by a stress fracture that kept him out of the rotation until the end of the season. Bauer struggled during the 2019 season, both with Cleveland and with Cincinnati, but he followed this effort with his first Cy Young Award during the 60-game 2020 MLB season. A free agent after the 2020 season, Bauer signed a three-year contract with the Dodgers in February 2021. He led the league in both strikeouts and innings pitched through July 2 but spent the rest of the season on administrative leave imposed by MLB as they investigated sexual assault allegations made against him, which continued into the following season. On April 29, 2022, the league announced that Bauer would be suspended for 324 games as a result of their investigation." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Big Dave McLean (born August 23, 1952) is a Canadian blues guitarist, harmonicist, singer and songwriter. A veteran performer, his work has had an influence on many western Canadian blues musicians, including Colin James and Wide Mouth Mason. Notable McLean songs include \"She's Got the Stuff\", \"Kanadiana\", \"Up On Waverly\", and \"St. Mary At Main\". Billboard noted that \"Big Dave's been the quintessential behind-the-scene bluesman. He's done more to shape the Western Canadian blues scene than perhaps any other artist\". In 2019, Big Dave McLean was awarded the Order of Canada for his musical influence of Delta and Chicago blues and for mentoring musicians." ;

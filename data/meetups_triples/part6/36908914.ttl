His service included active duty in the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War, American Intervention in China, World War I, as well as numerous smaller actions in South America. His service during World War I led to the further development of hydrophone technology to hunt submarines. Following World War I Leigh rose to the rank of four-star admiral and served as Commander, Battle Force, U.S. Fleet (COMBATFOR) from 1931 to 1932 and as Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet (CINCUS) from 1932 to 1933." ;

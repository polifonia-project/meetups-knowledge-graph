        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carlos José Castilho (November 27, 1927 – February 2, 1987) was a Brazilian football goalkeeper. He was born in Rio de Janeiro and played for Fluminense from 1947 to 1964 and for Brazil. He was a member of the Brazil squad in four World Cups: 1950, 1954, 1958 and 1962, but he only actually played three games, all of them in the 1954 finals. He was noted as a goalkeeper for making seemingly impossible saves. Due to his good luck, his opponents' supporters called him \"Leiteria\" (lucky man) and Fluminense supporters called him \"Saint Castilho\". He was daltonic and he believed he was favored because he saw yellow balls as if they were red, though he had trouble at night with white balls. During his career he appeared in 699 games for Fluminense, a club record. With Fluminense, he won 420 games, conceded 777 goals, and kept 255 clean-sheets; all individual records in Fluminense history. After his retirement from playing sport, he coached many teams from Brazil. He committed suicide on February 2, 1987." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elaine Malbin (born May 24, 1929 in New York City) is an American soprano who had a prolific international career singing in operas, musicals, and concerts from the 1940s through the 1960s. She made her Town Hall debut at the age of 14. She appeared in a number of Broadway productions in the 1940s and 1950s and notably portrayed Marsinah in the original 1953 West End production of Kismet. She starred on Broadway in the title role of My Darlin’ Aida & sang a season of Gilbert and Sullivan at the Mark Hellinger Theater in New York. She was a regular at the New York City Opera during the 1950s and 1960s with leading roles in Love for Three Oranges, Carmen (Micaela), Turandot (Liù), La Bohème (Mimi) and Don Giovanni (Zerlina). She appeared with most of America's leading opera companies during this time as well, including the Houston Grand Opera and the San Francisco Opera. In San Francisco Malbin debuted in a staged version of Carmina Burnana and sang Mimi in La Bohème. She also appeared in concert with several notable orchestras including the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. On the International stage she appeared at a number of opera houses and major music festivals in the United Kingdom, Italy, and France. She performed at the Glyndebourne and Edinburgh Festivals as well as Madama Butterfly with the Scottish Opera Company. She is perhaps best remembered for appearing in several opera roles live for television with the NBC Opera Theatre and for recording music with Mario Lanza for the 1951 film The Great Caruso. Malbin’s first television opera was as Violetta in La Traviata opposite Lawrence Tibbett at the age of 19. Malbin then starred in NBC Television Operas, some available for viewing at the Paley Center, including I Pagliacci, Il Tabarro, Suor Angelica, Salome, Dialogues of the Carmelites, the world premiere of Norman Dello Joio’s A Trial at Rouen and La Traviata. Her portrayal of Cio-Cio-San in Madama Butterly is lauded as perhaps her premiere performance. NBC developed a touring company featuring Miss Malbin following the success of the television performances. Concert performances included summer venues including the Greek Theater in Los Angeles, Jones Beach in New York and The Robin Hood Dell in Philadelphia. Smaller venue performances included El San Juan Hotel, San Juan & The Riviera in Havana. Her recordings for RCA Victor include an album with Mario Lanza. Malbin appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, Perry Como, and Eddie Fisher Shows, in addition to multiple appearances on The Voice of Firestone and the Jack Parr and Johnny Carson Tonight Shows. On July 4, 1962 Malbin sang at the special request of President John F. Kennedy at the Independence Day celebration at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Malbin also performed for President Nixon, President Truman and President Johnson. Malbin retired at the height of her career in 1968. She returned to the stage in January 1979 as Cleopatra in Handel’s Giulio Cesare at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. She also gave a recital at Alice Tully Hall the same year. Following these two major performances Malbin returned to semi-retirement. She became involved with teaching, mentoring young artists and working with the boards of several opera and arts foundations. Her television operas have been featured with events at the Paley Center in NY. She attends each event and sits on discussion panels." ;

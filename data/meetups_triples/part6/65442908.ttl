        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clark Jones (April 10, 1920 â€“ March 28, 2002) was an American television director. He gained acclaim in the early days of television as a director of live programming. He began working in television at an experimental station in 1941. During the 1950s, directed numerous musical and variety programs, including Your Hit Parade, a precedent-breaking closed circuit broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera, The Ford 50th Anniversary Show, Caesar's Hour, the award-winning 1955 television broadcast of Peter Pan, and the Royal Ballet's performance of Cinderella. During the 1960s, he continued to specialize in variety and music programs, including The Perry Como Show, The Bell Telephone Hour, The Sammy Davis Jr. Show, and The Carol Burnett Show. In the later years of his career, he was known principally for his direction of special event programming, including two Frank Sinatra specials and 19 Tony Award award ceremonies. Over the course of his television career, Jones was nominated for nine Primetime Emmy Awards and three Directors Guild of America Awards." ;

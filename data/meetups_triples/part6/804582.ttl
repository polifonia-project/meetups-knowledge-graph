        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peggy Ann Garner (February 3, 1932 â€“ October 16, 1984) was an American child actress. As a child actress, Garner had her first film role in 1938. At the 18th Academy Awards, Garner won the Academy Juvenile Award, recognizing her body of contributions to film in 1945, particularly in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn and Junior Miss. Featured roles in such films as Black Widow (1954) did not help to establish her in mature film roles, although she progressed to theatrical work and she made acting appearances on television as an adult. In the mid-1940s, as a promotional trailer to the popular Christmas holiday movie Miracle on 34th Street Garner appeared as herself on a studio lot accompanied by other young performers. In 1961 she starred next to Richard Boone in the episode Dream Girl on Have Gun - Will Travel." ;

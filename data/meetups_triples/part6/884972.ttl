        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edwin Franko Goldman (January 1, 1878 â€“ February 21, 1956) was an American composer and conductor. One of the most significant American band composers of the early 20th century, Goldman composed over 150 works, but is best known for his marches. He founded the renowned Goldman Band of New York City and the American Bandmasters Association. Goldman's works are characterized by their pleasant and catchy tunes, as well as their fine trios and solos. He also encouraged audiences to whistle/hum along to his marches. He wrote singing and whistling into the score of \"On the Mall\" (which vies with \"Chimes of Liberty\" as his two most-enduring marches)." ;

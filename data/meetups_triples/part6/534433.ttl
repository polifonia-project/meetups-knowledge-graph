        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kenneth Douglas Taylor, OC (October 5, 1934 â€“ October 15, 2015) was a Canadian diplomat, educator and businessman, best known for his role in the 1979 covert operation called the \"Canadian Caper\" when he was the Canadian ambassador to Iran. With the cooperation of the American Central Intelligence Agency, Taylor helped six Americans escape from Iran during the Iran hostage crisis by procuring Canadian passports for the Americans to deceive the Iranian Revolutionary guard by posing as a Canadian film crew scouting locations. Before the escape, the six Americans spent several weeks hiding in the homes of Taylor and another Canadian diplomat, John Sheardown. Taylor is portrayed by Gordon Pinsent in the Canadian 1981 television film, Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper which dramatizes the cover story for the operation. The later 2012 American film, Argo, focuses more on the CIA and Hollywood's role, with Taylor played by Canadian actor Victor Garber. After his death, The Washington Post described Taylor as the \"main hero\" of the Iran hostage escape \"who orchestrated the entire process\", quoting former president Jimmy Carter in doing so. In 1981, Taylor was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President Ronald Reagan. Nonetheless, the significance of his role was downplayed in the film Argo." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ashikaga Yoshikazu (足利 義量, August 27, 1407 – March 17, 1425) was the fifth shōgun of the Ashikaga shogunate who reigned from 1423 to 1425 during the Muromachi period of Japan. Yoshikazu was the son of the fourth shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimochi. Yoshimochi ceded power to his son, and Yoshikazu became Sei-i Taishōgun at age 18, but he would die within two years. According to Oguri Hangan ichidaiki, Yoshikazu's death was hastened by a life of drunken dissipation. His buddhist name was Chōjo'in (長得院). In 1423, was Yoshikazu appointed shōgun. A year later the Emperor Go-Kameyama dies. Yoshikazu would rule for a brief reign as he dies in 1425 and is succeeded by his father Yoshimochi that same year. When his father died in 1428, Go-Hanazono ascends the throne in second repudiation of agreement. The sixth official shōgun became Ashikaga Yoshinori in 1429." ;

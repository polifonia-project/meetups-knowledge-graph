During the 1920s, Tex Rickard was the leading promoter of the day, and he has been compared to P. T. Barnum and Don King. Sports journalist Frank Deford has written that Rickard \"first recognized the potential of the star system.\" Rickard also operated several saloons, hotels, and casinos, all named Northern and located in Alaska, Nevada, and Canada." ;

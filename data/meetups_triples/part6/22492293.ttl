        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gordon Frank Newell (January 25, 1925 – February 16, 2001) was an American scientist, known for his contributions to applied mathematics, in particular traffic flow analysis and queueing theory. Newell authored over one hundred articles and wrote several books. The Gordon–Newell theorem is named after him and his colleague . Their algorithms helped form the basis of most modern automatically controlled and networked traffic-light control systems. He obtained a B.Sc. from Union College, New York (1945) anda Ph.D. in physics from University of Illinois (1950). Hecontinued his focus on solid-state physics and the Ising model of statistical mechanics with research teams under Elliott Montroll at University of Maryland, College Park (1950–53). His next job was at the applied mathematics faculty at Brown University (1953), where he began studies of automobile traffic analysis and road signalling theory. His final period was with the civil engineering faculty at University of California, Berkeley (1965–91), where he remained until retirement. He then held a professor emeritus of Transportation Engineering position. The annual Gordon Newell fellowship has been awarded since 2002. He was born in Dayton, Ohio and raised in Rochester, New York. Newell died in an automobile accident in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, after attending a party with friends." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Abraham Gilbert Saffron (6 October 1919 â€“ 15 September 2006) was an Australian hotelier, nightclub owner and property developer who was one of the major figures in organised crime in Australia in the latter half of the 20th century. For several decades, members of government, the judiciary and the media made repeated allegations that Saffron was involved in a wide range of criminal activities, including illegal alcohol sales, dealing in stolen goods, illegal gambling, prostitution, drug dealing, bribery and extortion. He was charged with a range of offences including \"scandalous conduct\", possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of stolen goods, but his only major conviction was for federal tax evasion. He gained nationwide notoriety in the media, earning various nicknames including \"Mr Sin\", \"a Mr Big of Australian crime\" and \"the boss of the Cross\" (a reference to the Kings Cross red-light district, where he owned numerous businesses). In March 2021, ABC Television aired an investigative documentary series, \"The Ghost Train Fire\", which directly implicated Saffron in an arson plot at Luna Park Sydney in 1979, resulting in the deaths of seven people, including six children. Former senior police officers testified on camera that Saffron ordered the crime, which was swiftly and systematically covered up by corrupt police and government figures. Saffron always vigorously denied such accusations, and was renowned for the extent to which he was willing to sue for libel against his accusers." ;

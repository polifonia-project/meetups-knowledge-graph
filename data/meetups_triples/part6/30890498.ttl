Johnson adopted his stage name as a teenager as a reference to the Dorian scale. Dorian Concept is also a member of the Austrian funk band Jacob's Salty and Bamboozling Ladder (JSBL). He also has periodically toured as a keyboardist for Flying Lotus (along with Richard Spaven on drums) and collaborated with the Cinematic Orchestra." ;

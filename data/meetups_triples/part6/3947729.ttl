After the death of his father Newel Knight, Jesse's family was poor throughout his youth. As a young man, he worked as a prospector and discovered the in the Tintic Mining District near Eureka, Utah in 1896. As the Humbug proved profitable, he acquired other mines in the vicinity, including the Uncle Sam, Beck Tunnel, Iron Blossom, and Colorado mines. After making his fortune, Knight went on to found the Latter Day Saint settlement of Raymond, Alberta, Canada. In 1964, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum." ;

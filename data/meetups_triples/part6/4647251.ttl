        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harini (born 30 April 1979) is an Indian film playback singer and classical singer who sings in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada films, working with many leading film composers. She is married to another playback singer, Tippu. Harini learnt Carnatic music from Gowri and Radha Viswanathan from the age of four. In her later years, she learned from Sudha Raghunathan and currently from Suguna Purushotthaman. She used to participate in school competitions and in one such competition which she won, A. R. Rahman who distributed the prizes invited the winners to his studio to record their voices. Subsequently, she was called by Suhasini Maniratnam to sing \"Nila Kaigirathu\" for her first film Indira. Her first song, \"Nila Kaigirathu\", was recorded at the age of 15. Since then, she has received offers from various music directors across South India. Within a career spanning a decade, she sang over 3500 film songs and several album songs, most of them in Tamil." ;

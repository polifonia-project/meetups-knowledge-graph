        mtp:hasAbstract        "Karim Fall, better known by his stage name Lefa (born 28 November 1985 in Paris), is a French rapper and dancer. He is a founding member of the French rap / hip hop collective Sexion d'Assaut. He has also released solo materials in 2015 and 2016. In June 2015 he released his debut solo album Monsieur Fall with big commercial success. He was born to the Senegalese jazz musician Cheikh Tidiane Fall and his mother was a French choreographer and art therapist Christiane de Rougemont. He grew up in the 18e arrondissement of Paris and his beginnings were in breakdance. He has closely collaborated with artists Black M and Gims, also members of Sexion d'Assaut, appearing on many of their albums. His friend Ma√Ætre Gims named him Lefa (French slang for Fall, Lefa's family name). Later in 2013, he was reintroduced back in taking part in their 2013 tour but at much lower key, with Lefa deciding to concentrate more on his solo work. 2015-2016 was a veritable comeback with the release of the single \"Quelques minutes\" in 2015 and the album Monsieur Fall in February 2016." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Keisha Kerreece Fayeanne Buchanan (/ˈkiːʃə/; born 30 September 1984) is an English singer and a founding member of the girl group Sugababes alongside Mutya Buena and Siobhán Donaghy. With the Sugababes, she had six number one singles and two number one studio albums, making them one of the most successful British pop acts of the 21st century. Buchanan was asked to leave the group in September 2009 and was replaced by Jade Ewen. In 2012, she and her former Sugababes colleagues Buena and Donaghy confirmed their reunion. The original trio was not able to release music under the name \"Sugababes\" as it was still being used by the then-current members of the group. Instead they released music under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan before securing the legal rights to the Sugababes name in 2019." ;

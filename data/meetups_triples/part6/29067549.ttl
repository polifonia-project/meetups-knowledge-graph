        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clara Chung (born October 31, 1987), known by her stage name CLARA (previously Clara C), is an American singer-songwriter, producer and composer. She is a music artist who rose to fame on Youtube when she won numerous talent competitions in a row including JC Penney's Talent Search, Los Angelesâ€™ Kollaboration 10, KAC Media Juice Night, and ISA 2009. CLARA is a self-taught multi-instrumentalist who writes, produces, and directs her own content. CLARA's sweet, sultry vocals paired with soul-stirring music make her an artist to remember. CLARA has independently sold out tours worldwide and has performed at the Hollywood Bowl, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and for the White House's U.S. Department of Education. CLARA's music has been featured in commercials, Film & TV (Netflix's Big Mouth) and can be heard in public spaces all around the globe. CLARA also composes for cosmetics industry titan Bobbi Brown." ;

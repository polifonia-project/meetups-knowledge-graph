She rose to prominence as Karen McDonald in Coronation Street between 2000 to 2004. Upon leaving, she furthered her television career in drama series including Vincent (2005–2006), Strictly Confidential (2006) and Harley Street (2008). Her portrayal of convicted murderer Ruth Slater in the mini-series Unforgiven (2009) received acclaim. Between 2011 and 2016, Jones starred as Detective Rachel Bailey in the police procedural Scott & Bailey, her second collaboration with screenwriter Sally Wainwright after Unforgiven.

For her portrayal of Gemma Foster, a successful GP who suffers personal betrayal, in Doctor Foster (2015–2017), Jones won several awards including a Broadcasting Press Guild award and the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress in 2016. Following the conclusion of Doctor Foster, Jones returned to theatre, starring in a production of Frozen for which she received favourable notices.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "George John Bailey (born 7 September 1982) is a former Australian cricketer, who played all formats for the national team and captained the team in limited-over formats. Domestically, Bailey played for the Tasmanian cricket team in all three domestic state competitions (the Sheffield Shield, One-Day Cup and KFC Twenty20 Big Bash) as well as the Hobart Hurricanes and Melbourne Stars in the Twenty20 Big Bash's successor, the KFC Big Bash League. He has also played in the Indian Premier League and T20 Blast. Bailey was appointed as Twenty20 captain of the Australian national team in 2012, succeeding Cameron White prior to the two match series against India that ended 1–1. He became the second ever Australian to captain an international game without having played an international game before, after Dave Gregory in the first ever Test match. On 1 May 2013, Bailey was appointed the vice-captain of the Australian ODI team for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. He captained the Australian team in India in ODI in the absence of Michael Clarke. In November 2013, Bailey was named in the Australian team for the 2013–14 Ashes series against England. He played all five matches of the series, but was subsequently dropped from the Test team. In the 2017–18 season, Bailey won his first Ricky Ponting Medal for Tasmania's best player in the previous season. He was appointed as the chief selector of Cricket Australia in August 2021." ;

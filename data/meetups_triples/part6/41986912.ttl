        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dave Burland (born 12 July 1941, Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England) is an English folk singer and guitarist. A former policeman, he has been performing in English folk clubs since 1968 and has been described by The Guardian as having a \"uniquely relaxed singing style\". In 1976 Burland joined the folk group Hedgehog Pie, which disbanded in 1978. He re-formed the group in 2010, with Mick Doonan and Jed Grimes. He provided additional vocals on the track \"Wild Goose\" on Kate Rusby's award-winning 1999 album Sleepless." ;

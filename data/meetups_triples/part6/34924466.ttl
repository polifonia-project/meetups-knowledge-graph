        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sean Andrew McGinty (born 11 August 1993) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender for Scottish club Ayr United, who he also captains. After a spell with Charlton Athletic as a junior, he began his professional career with Manchester United. Having failed to break into the United first team, he had loan spells at Morecambe, Oxford United, Carlisle United and Tranmere Rovers before signing for Sheffield United on a permanent basis. He had loan spells at Northampton Town and Rochdale, signing permanently for the latter at the end of his only season in Sheffield. He then spent time on loan at FC Halifax Town and Aldershot Town before again making the move permanent. In June 2016, he signed for Torquay United, where he spent two seasons before moving to Scottish club Partick Thistle. In 2020, he would leave to join Greenock Morton for a season. In the summer of 2021, McGinty signed a two-year deal with Ayr United, following his previous manager David Hopkin. Born in Maidstone, Kent, he played internationally for the Republic of Ireland at under-17, under-19 and under-21 level." ;

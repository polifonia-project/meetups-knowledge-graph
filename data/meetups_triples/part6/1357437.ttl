        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Keelaghan (born October 28, 1959) is a Canadian folk singer-songwriter. Born in Calgary, Alberta, Keelaghan is now based in Perth, Ontario. Many of the lyrics in his songs display a concern about social problems and justice in society. Examples of such themes include \"Kiri's Piano\", about the internment of Japanese Canadians, and \"October 70\", about the FLQ crisis, inspired by events and figures in Canadian history. Some of his songs concern tragic historical events, such as \"Fires of Calais,\" about the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation of Allied troops during World War II, and \"Cold Missouri Waters,\" about the Mann Gulch fire of 1949. Keelaghan's lilting baritone voice, driving rhythm guitar, and a sense of scene and narrative result in his ability to bridge traditional folk music with roots revival and Celtic music." ;

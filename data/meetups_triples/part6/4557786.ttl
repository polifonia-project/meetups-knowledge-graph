        mtp:hasAbstract        "Todd Steven Collins (born November 5, 1971) is a former American football quarterback. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round of the 1995 NFL Draft. He played college football at Michigan. Collins also played for the Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Redskins. After beginning his career as the heir apparent to Jim Kelly and largely failing in that position, he spent the rest of his NFL career as a backup quarterback, spending several years serving behind Elvis Grbac and Trent Green of the Chiefs. He holds the NFL record for longest gap between starts in post-merger history, ten years and two days. Collins is now the offensive coordinator for the Walpole High School varsity football team." ;

Topolsky was the co-founder and editor-in-chief of technology news network The Verge, and a co-creator of its parent company Vox Media. Previously, he was the editor-in-chief of Engadget. On August 4, 2014, Topolsky stepped down from The Verge and Vox Media to join Bloomberg \"as the editor of a series of new online ventures it is introducing as part of a revamped journalism strategy\". He left Bloomberg in July 2015 after clashes with Michael Bloomberg over the direction of its digital media strategy and started the digital news company The Outline." ;

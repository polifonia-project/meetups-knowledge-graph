        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gerda Alexander (February 15, 1908 â€“ February 21, 1994) was of German / Danish teacher who developed a \"bodymind technique\" or \"somatic practice\" known as Eutony. As a young woman, Gerda was in contact with the vanguards of the arts, education, and movement culture in the early 20th century. From the 30's on, she started to develop her innovative method through her studies between movement and musicality, new pedagogies and neurosciences. Through Eutony, she collaborated with many medical centers, pedagogical institutions, and artistic training in Europe, North and South America and the Middle East. Gerda Alexander was a pioneer among the creators of somatic education practices in the world. Her school in Copenhagen trained professionals for 45 years." ;

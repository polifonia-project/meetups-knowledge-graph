        mtp:hasAbstract        "Emanuela Trane (born 16 May 1977),[ˌdoltʃeˈneːra], is an Italian singer, songwriter and actress. She rose to fame in 2003, after winning the newcomers' section of the Sanremo Music Festival, but she achieved commercial success in Italy only in 2005, when she won the music-based reality show Music Farm and she released her second album, Un mondo perfetto. In 2005 she was also awarded Best New Artist of the Year at the Italian Meeting of Independent Record Labels and she received the De André Award for Best Emerging Artist. Dolcenera participated again in the Sanremo Music Festival in 2006—when she sang the hit single \"Com'è straordinaria la vita\", included in the album Il popolo dei sogni—and in 2009, singing \"Il mio amore unico\", from her fourth studio set Dolcenera nel paese delle meraviglie, the first one released by a major label, Sony Music. After signing with EMI, she released her fifth studio album in 2011, titled Evoluzione della specie. During the same year, she appeared on the Italian version of Professor Green's single \"Read All About It (Tutto quello che devi sapere)\", which was also included in the 2012 edition of Evoluzione della specie, released after Dolcenera's participation in the Sanremo Music Festival 2012 with \"Ci vediamo a casa\"." ;

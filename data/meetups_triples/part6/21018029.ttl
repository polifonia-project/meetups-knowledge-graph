        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sir Charles Cavendish (13 Aug 1591 – 4 Feb 1653) was an English aristocrat, Member of Parliament for Nottingham, and patron. Described as 'a little, weak, crooked man’ by John Aubrey, he studied mathematics himself, as well as supporting others, including Walter Warner, Robert Payne, and William Oughtred. During the First English Civil War from 1642 to 1646, he became a Lieutenant General in the Royalist army in the north, under his brother, William, Earl of Newcastle. He accompanied him into exile after the defeat at Marston Moor in July 1644. At the request of his brother, he returned to England in 1651, and managed to purchase Bolsover Castle and Welbeck Abbey, which had been confiscated by Parliament. He died at Bolsover in February 1654." ;

Watson developed his signature eight-fingered tapping technique during his time in the band. He appeared as a special guest on Douglas Docker's Docker's Guild project. Watson has also released solo albums. In 2007, he was fired by the three other members of Night Ranger through a letter from their attorney. During 2009 Jeff was part of Dennis DeYoung's travelling band." ;

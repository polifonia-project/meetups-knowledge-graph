        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rui Manuel Gaudêncio Veloso ComIH (born 30 July 1957) is a Portuguese singer-songwriter and musician. Commonly called \"The father of Portuguese rock\" (Portuguese: O pai do rock português), Veloso was a major figure in the boom of Portuguese rock music in the 1980s. His debut album Ar de Rock (1980), including the hit single \"Chico Fininho\", is considered a landmark of Portuguese rock. During the 1980s and 1990s, Veloso released numerous other successful singles and albums in Portugal. An unconditional lover of blues music, he played with B.B. King several times in King's shows in Portugal." ;

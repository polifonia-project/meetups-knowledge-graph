        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Jacobs (December 27, 1942 â€“ December 24, 2015) was an American basketball coach. Jacobs was head coach of the men's basketball team of Loyola Marymount University. After turning the program around in just one season, he was invited by Philippine businessman Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. to coach the Philippines men's national basketball team. Jacobs brought the Philippines back to prominence in basketball during the 1980s. He revolutionized the way basketball was played in the Philippines. He raised the level of technology in playing the game and turned every contest into a learning experience by showing how to win with science, hard work, team play and discipline." ;

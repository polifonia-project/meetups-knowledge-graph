        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stephen J. Farrell (December 26, 1863 â€“ October 17, 1933) was professional track athlete, circus performer and track coach. Farrell was a professional foot-racer in the 1880s and 1890s, beginning as a competitor in the hook, hose and ladder teams of New England. He was the first American to win England's on two occasions and competed in races from 100 yards to one mile. He became known as \"the greatest professional footracer this country has ever known.\" Seeking out new challenges, Farrell performed with the Barnum & Bailey Circus for several years racing against a horse, and he was never known to ever lose to the horse.(Farrell proudly noted that, in several years of racing horses with the circus, \"he was beaten only half a dozen times by the horse during the years\" .)Farrell later became a track coach at Yale University, the University of Maine, Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan. He coached at Michigan for 18 years and developed many great athletes, including DeHart Hubbard and Eddie Tolan." ;

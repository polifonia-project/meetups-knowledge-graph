He was a director of Royal Exchange Assurance and of Army & Navy Stores. Hamilton was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Wellingborough in 1959, which he lost in 1964. He was then elected for Salisbury at a 1965 by-election, which he represented until he retired in 1983. He was an opposition whip from 1961 to 1964, a senior one from the second year (a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury). He was knighted in the 1983 Birthday Honours. He died in Chichester, West Sussex two days before his 82nd birthday." ;

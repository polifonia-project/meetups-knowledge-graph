        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Roland (born 6 September 1959) is an English singer-songwriter, author and music journalist. Roland typically writes his songs in the form of stories, often addressing historical figures, characters from literature and film, or his own creations. He has explored genres including gothic rock, psychedelic pop, folk and baroque. Described by Music Week as a \"psychedelic cult celebrity\", Roland has enjoyed an underground career as opposed to mainstream success, gathering a stronger fanbase in mainland Europe than in his native UK. He has been credited with spearheading steampunk music. Aside from his recording career, Roland has worked as a music journalist, and has authored numerous books on subjects including popular music, crime, World War II, and the supernatural." ;

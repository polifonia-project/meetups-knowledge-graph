        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lawrence Brownlee (born November 24, 1972) is an American operatic tenor particularly associated with the bel canto repertoire. Describing his voice, Speight Jenkins, general director of the Seattle Opera, said: \"There are other singers that sing this repertory very well, but I don't think anyone else has quite as beautiful a sound and as rounded a tone,\" and praise his \"incredible top notes\", adding about his high F (F5) in \"Credeasi, misera\": \"With him it's not a scream, it's a beautiful sound.\" Mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato adds: \"He is always in service of the music. His natural instrument is just incredibly beautiful. The word 'honey' comes to mind. He also has technical prowess and agility.\"" ;

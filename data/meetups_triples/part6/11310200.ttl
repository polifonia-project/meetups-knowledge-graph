        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donald Maurice Ginsberg (November 19, 1933 – May 7, 2007) was an American physicist and expert on superconductors. Born in Chicago, Ginsberg attended the University of Chicago, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1952, a Bachelor of Science in 1955, and a Master of Science in 1956. He then earned his doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1960. He taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1959 to 1996 and in 1998 he won the American Physical Society's Oliver E. Buckley Prize for his work on high temperature superconductivity. This is the highest award in condensed matter physics and a great honor for humble Ginsberg. One of Ginsberg's greatest achievements was creating yttrium-barium-copper-oxide samples; at the time these were universally recognized as the world's finest samples of yttrium-barium-copper-oxide. Ginsberg shared his samples with the worldwide scientific community freely." ;

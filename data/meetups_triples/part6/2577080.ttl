        mtp:hasAbstract        "Flora Alejandra Pizarnik (29 April 1936 – 25 September 1972) was an Argentine poet. Her idiosyncratic and thematically introspective poetry has been considered \"one of the most unusual bodies of work in Latin American literature\", and has been recognized and celebrated for its fixation on \"the limitation of language, silence, the body, night, the nature of intimacy, madness, [and] death\". Pizarnik studied philosophy at the Universidad de Buenos Aires and worked as a writer and a literary critic for several editorials and magazines. She lived in Paris between 1960 and 1964, where she translated authors such as Antonin Artaud, Henri Michaux, Aimé Cesairé and Yves Bonnefoy. She also studied history of religion and French literature in La Sorbonne. Back in Buenos Aires, Pizarnik published three of her major works: Los trabajos y las noches, Extracción de la piedra de locura and El infierno musical as well as a prose work titled, La condesa sangrienta. In 1969 she received a Guggenheim Fellowship and later, in 1971, a Fulbright Fellowship. On September 25, 1972, she died by suicide after ingesting an overdose of secobarbital. Her work has influenced generations of authors in Latin America." ;

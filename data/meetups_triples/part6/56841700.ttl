She was the recipient of the Rapallo Carige Prize for Le strade di polvere (The Dusty Roads) in 1988. Born Rosetta Provera, she was the youngest of four children of a Piedmontese father and a mother from Rome. She wrote her first story at the age of nine, but her real literary vocation manifested itself towards the age of twenty-five. However, she had to wait until 1974 for her first publication, The Bicycle." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Amber Laura Heard (born April 22, 1986) is an American actress. She had her first leading role in the horror film All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006), and went on to star in films such as The Ward (2010) and Drive Angry (2011). She has also had supporting roles in films including Pineapple Express (2008), Never Back Down (2008), The Joneses (2009), Machete Kills (2013), Magic Mike XXL (2015), and The Danish Girl (2015). Heard is part of the DC Extended Universe franchise, playing Mera in Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), and the forthcoming Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023). She has also acted in television series such as Hidden Palms (2007) and The Stand (2020). Heard is an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador on women's rights and was a Human Rights Champion for the Stand Up for Human Rights campaign by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Heard married actor Johnny Depp in 2015. The dissolution of the marriage in May 2016 garnered widespread media attention when Heard filed a restraining order against Depp in which she cited domestic violence. Depp would later file a defamation lawsuit against British tabloid newspaper The Sun over their coverage of Heard's domestic abuse allegations, and another against Heard herself for an op-ed published in her name in the Washington Post. While Depp lost the former lawsuit, the latter, over which Heard filed a countersuit, became the subject of a widely-publicized trial, which concluded with a jury finding both Heard and Depp liable for defamation and left Heard in $8.35 million debt to Depp. Heard received widespread backlash over her allegations and the subsequent court cases, particularly on social media." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Windham Lawrence Rotunda (born May 23, 1987) is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Bray Wyatt. Rotunda is a third-generation professional wrestler, following in the footsteps of his grandfather Blackjack Mulligan, his father Mike Rotunda, and two of his uncles â€“ Barry and Kendall Windham. His younger brother Taylor Rotunda is also a professional wrestler, best known as Bo Dallas. Alongside his brother, he held the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice while in WWE's then-developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he wrestled under various ring names between 2008 and 2012. He briefly wrestled on WWE's main roster from 2010 to 2011 under the ring name Husky Harris, most notably as a member of The Nexus. After returning to WWE's developmental territories, Rotunda was rebranded as Bray Wyatt, the villainous cult leader of The Wyatt Family, with the group eventually making its main roster debut in 2013. He became a three-time world champion in WWE, having held the WWE Championship once and the Universal Championship twice. He also held the SmackDown Tag Team Championship (with Luke Harper and Randy Orton under the Freebird rule) and the Raw Tag Team Championship (with Matt Hardy) once each. After taking a hiatus in August 2018, Wyatt returned to WWE programming in April 2019 with a different gimmick, debuting the horror-themed character The Fiend. Portrayed as suffering from a transformative multiple personality disorder, The Fiend randomly switched back and forth between his good side of a Mr. Rogers-esque children's television host Bray Wyatt, and his bad side of a grotesque monster clown, The Fiend. Wyatt was released from WWE in July 2021, but returned to the company in October 2022." ;

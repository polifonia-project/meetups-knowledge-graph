        mtp:hasAbstract        "Shezad Dawood (born 1974) is an artist born and based in London. Shezad Dawood works across the disciplines of painting, film, neon, sculpture, performance, virtual reality and other digital media to ask key questions of narrative, history and embodiment. He uses collaboration and knowledge exchange, mapping across multiple audiences and communities. Through a fascination with the esoteric, otherness, the environment and architectures both material and virtual, Dawood interweaves stories, realities and symbolism to create richly layered artworks. These multi-media works are also inspired by his varied cultural heritage, having a Pakistani mother, an Indian father and an Irish stepmother. He trained at Central Saint Martin's and received his MA from the Royal College of Art in 2000 before undertaking a PhD from the School of Arts at Leeds Metropolitan University (now Leeds Beckett University) in 2008 (Fine Art), titled 'The killing of Chief Crazy Horse: a metaphorical allegory in 3 parts'. Dawood is a Research Fellow in Experimental Media at the University of Westminster." ;

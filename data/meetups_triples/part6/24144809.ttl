A self-made man, he was a founder of one of the largest savings and loans in the United States only to lose it all a few years before his death. Lytton, who contributed significantly to the John F. Kennedy presidential campaign in 1960, was \"brash, colorful and controversial\" and called himself \"the most successful businessman in this decade in the U.S.\", declaring \"The only ism for me is narcissism\"." ;

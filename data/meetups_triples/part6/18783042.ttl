        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronda Jean Rousey (/ˈraʊzi/; born February 1, 1987) is an American professional wrestler, actress, former judoka and mixed martial artist. She is currently signed to WWE, where she performs on the SmackDown brand and is the current SmackDown Women’s Champion in her second reign. She is best known for her time in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Her long standing nickname, \"Rowdy\", was inherited from professional wrestler Roddy Piper. The first American female to earn an Olympic medal in judo by winning bronze at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Rousey began her mixed martial arts (MMA) career with King of the Cage in 2011. She soon joined Strikeforce, becoming their last Women's Bantamweight Champion until its acquisition by UFC. Rousey was part of the company's first ever female fight at UFC 157, was their inaugural Women's Bantamweight Champion, and held the record for most UFC title defenses (6) by a female, until being surpassed by Valentina Shevchenko in 2022. Rousey retired from MMA in 2016 and was the first female fighter inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2018. Rousey began a career in professional wrestling in 2018, signing with WWE, and debuted at WrestleMania 34. She won the Raw Women's Championship at that year's SummerSlam, and headlined WWE's inaugural all-women's pay-per-view when she defended her title at WWE Evolution. Rousey lost the title in the first-ever women's WrestleMania main event at WrestleMania 35. Rousey returned at Royal Rumble 2022, winning the women's Royal Rumble match. She later challenged Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania 38 in a losing effort. At WrestleMania Backlash the following month, Rousey defeated Flair in an \"I Quit\" match to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. She later lost the title to Liv Morgan due to a money-in-the-bank cash-in and regained the title at Extreme Rules making her a two-time SmackDown Womens Champion. Rousey is the only woman to be the champion in both the UFC and WWE, as well as the only woman to headline a pay-per-view event in both companies. She was voted the best female athlete of all time in a 2015 ESPN fan poll, and Fox Sports described her as \"one of the defining athletes of the 21st century.\" Rousey has also appeared in films, including The Expendables 3 (2014), Furious 7 (2015), and Mile 22 (2018), and relegraphy My Fight / Your Fight in 2015." ;

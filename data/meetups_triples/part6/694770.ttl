        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ernest Scott Garrett (born July 9, 1959) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for New Jersey's 5th congressional district, serving from 2003 to 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the New Jersey General Assembly from 1990 to 2003. Garrett chaired the United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. He lost his reelection bid in 2016 to Democrat Josh Gottheimer, becoming the only incumbent Congressman in New Jersey to be defeated that year. On June 19, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Garrett to become chairman and president of the Export–Import Bank of the United States, a post that requires confirmation by the United States Senate. In a 10–13 vote on December 19, 2017, the Senate Banking Committee declined to advance his nomination. Garrett was subsequently hired into an excepted service position at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of General Counsel." ;

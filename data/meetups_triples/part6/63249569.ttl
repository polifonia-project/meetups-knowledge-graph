Ahgren is best known for his live streams on Twitch from 2018 through late 2021, and on YouTube beginning in late 2021, where he broadcasts video-game-related content as well as non-video-game-related content such as game shows, and contests. He is also known for his work as an esports commentator at various Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments. Since beginning streaming full-time on February 16, 2019, Ahgren has become one of the largest streamers on YouTube. While holding a widely publicized \"subathon\" event, Ahgren became the most subscribed Twitch streamer of all time in 2021, eventually reaching around 282,000 subscribers at its peak, beating the previous record set by fellow streamer Ninja. On November 29, 2021, Ahgren announced that he had signed an exclusive deal with YouTube Gaming. At the 2022 Streamer Awards, Ahgren won the award for \"Streamer of the Year\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dorsey Murdock Dixon (October 14, 1897, Darlington, South Carolina â€“ April 18, 1968, Plant City, Florida) was an American old-time and country music songwriter and musician. He was also a millworker who spent much of his life working in textile mills in North and South Carolina. Dixon's best known songs were \"Wreck on the Highway\", which resulted in a copyright dispute with country musician Roy Acuff, and \"Babies in the Mill\", which was about the Southern textile industry's exploitation of child labor in the early 20th century." ;

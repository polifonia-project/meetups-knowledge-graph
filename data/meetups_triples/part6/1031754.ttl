In 1940, he founded a vocal quartet named Quartetto Egie together with Tata Giacobetti, Enrico Gentile and Enrico De Angelis. They made their debut on 27 May 1940, at the Valle Theatre in Rome. They performed the song Bambina dall'abito blu (\"little girl in a blue dress\"). After a few months he left the group, which replaced him with Virgilio Savona and changed name to Quartetto Ritmo." ;

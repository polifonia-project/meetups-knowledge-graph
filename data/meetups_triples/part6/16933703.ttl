        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edvard Mik'aeli Mirzoyan (Armenian: Էդվարդ Միքայելի Միրզոյան; May 12, 1921 – October 5, 2012) was an Armenian composer. Edvard Mirzoyan was born in Gori, Georgia. He called himself an atheist, but added, \"There is only one planet on which people live and are being born. And while it is, it's a miracle. A miracle, every leaf and every bug.... And it all depends on how you are able to enjoy this miracle. Some do not even think that they were born into a miracle.\" He is considered one member of the group called \"Armenia's Mighty Handful\", a reference to the 19th century collective known as the \"Mighty Handful.\" He is also considered an integral part to the \"Armenian School\" of music composition alongside the composers Arno Babajanian and Alexander Arutiunian." ;

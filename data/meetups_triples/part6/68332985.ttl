        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Gregory Rossi (June 18, 1961 â€“ July 31, 2016) was a former United States Army general officer. An air defense artillery officer by profession, he commanded at all levels available in the career path, from battery to center of excellence. A 1983 graduate of the United States Military Academy, Rossi served 33 years in the United States Army. He commanded the United States Army Fires Center of Excellence from June 2014 to July 2016 and the 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command from March 2011 to July 2012. Rossi was found dead after hanging himself in his residence at Redstone Arsenal on July 31, 2016, two days before his scheduled promotion to lieutenant general to succeed David L. Mann as commander of United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command. He was the first American Army general to take his own life since record-keeping of suicides in the armed forces began in 2000." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Anthony Gosar (/ˈɡoʊsɑːr/ GOH-sar; born November 27, 1958) is an American far-right politician and former dentist who has been the U.S. representative for Arizona's 4th congressional district since 2013. A Republican, he was elected in 2010 to represent the neighboring 1st congressional district until redistricting. Gosar's support of conspiracy theories and alleged ties to the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Holocaust deniers have sparked controversy. Gosar opposes the Affordable Care Act, abortion, gun control, and immigration. He has been a strong ally of former president Donald Trump, and voted to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. On November 17, 2021, the House of Representatives censured Gosar and stripped him of committee assignments for posting on social media a photoshopped anime clip depicting him killing a \"titan\" with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's face and attacking a character with President Joe Biden's face. It was the first House censure since 2010 and only the 24th in American history." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sebastiaan Bleekemolen (born 9 August 1978 in Haarlem) is a Dutch racing driver that currently competes in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series, driving for the family-owned Team Bleekemolen in the No. 69 Ford Mustang in the Elite 1 class. His brother Jeroen and father Michael are also racing drivers. His father is a former Formula One driver, who has competed with RAM and ATS. Sebastiaan won the Benelux and Dutch Formula Ford 1800 championships in 1996, but decided early in his career formula racing was not his thing and already started driving sports cars and touring cars from 1997. Since 2002 he has been very successful in sports car racing and touring car racing. He became the Dutch Renault Clio Cup champion three times, winning the championship in 2002, 2004 and 2011. He won the Dutch Winter Endurance championship in 2003-04 and in 2009-10. Since 2010 he participated in the American Le Mans Series. He has always driven a Porsche 911 GT3 Cup in the GTC class, but with three different teams. Since the merger of the American Le Mans Series and the Rolex Sports Car Series, which became the IMSA Tudor United SportsCar Championship, he drives a SRT Viper GT3-R with Riley Motorsports in the GTD class together with his brother and Ben Keating." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Anthony O'Neill (13 October 1931 – 15 December 2007) was an Irish international football goalkeeper. He played 405 league games in a 17-year career in the Football League, and also won 17 caps for the Republic of Ireland. Though only 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), he was able to use his acrobatic ability to save the ball. He spent the whole of the 1950s with Everton, helping the \"Toffees\" to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1953–54. He was sold on to Stoke City for £5,000 in July 1960, and helped the \"Potters\" to top the Second Division table in 1962–63. He moved on to Darlington in March 1964, before signing with Port Vale in February 1965. He was loaned out to Cork Celtic in December 1966, before being allowed to join the club permanently on a free transfer in May 1967. He retired the following year, and later ran a taxi firm in Ormskirk." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Apollo Carreon Quiboloy (locally [kɪboˈlɔɪ]; born April 25, 1950) is a Filipino pastor and church leader of the Philippines-based Restorationist church called the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KJC). Previously a member of the United Pentecostal Church, he founded the KJC in 1985, and has made claims that he is \"the Appointed Son of God\" as well as being \"the Owner of the Universe\". In November 2021, prosecutors in California announced sex trafficking charges against Quiboloy, alleging that he and several others had sexually abused female church members aged 12 to 25 in exchange for privileges as well as avoiding \"eternal damnation\". Many of Quiboloy's assets have been described as ill-gotten." ;

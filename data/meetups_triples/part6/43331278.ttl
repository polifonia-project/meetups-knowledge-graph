She won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Music for her opera Angel's Bone, with libretto by Royce Vavrek. She was a 2018 Guggenheim Fellow. Du Yun was named as one of the 38 Great Immigrants by the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 2018, and received a 2019 Grammy nomination in the category of Best Classical Contemporary Composition for her work Air Glow. In its decade review, UK's Classical FM listed Du Yun's winning of the Pulitzer as No. 6 in \"10 ways the 2010s changed classical music forever.\" Rolling Stone Italia named her as one of the women composers who defined the 2010s." ;

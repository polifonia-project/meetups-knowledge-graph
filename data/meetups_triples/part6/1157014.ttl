        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Montgomery Shore (born February 1, 1968) is an American actor, comedian and filmmaker best known for his roles in several comedy films in the 1990s. Shore began as a stand-up comedian at the age of 17, before becoming an MTV VJ in 1989. This led to a starring role in the comedy film Encino Man in 1992, which was a modest hit. He followed this with leading man vehicles, including Son in Law (1993) and Bio-Dome (1996). Shore provided the voice of Robert \"Bobby\" Zimuruski in A Goofy Movie and its direct-to-video sequel, An Extremely Goofy Movie." ;

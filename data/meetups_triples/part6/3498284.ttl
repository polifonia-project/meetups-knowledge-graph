Under his leadership, the Rainbow Wahine won four national titles (1979, 1982, 1983, 1987). As of September 6, 2013 his record was 1,107–185–1, which translates to a winning percentage of 85.7%. On September 6, 2013 he became the winningest coach in Division I women's volleyball history with 1,107 wins, breaking the record formerly held by former UCLA head coach Andy Banachowski. Shoji earned the win in 4 games over Santa Clara University. His teams are known for having great ball control. Shoji coached many standout players, including Deitre Collins, Teee Williams, Angelica Ljungqvist, Robyn Ah Mow-Santos, Kim Willoughby, Kanani Danielson and Nikki Taylor. Ah-Mow Santos succeeded Shoji as head coach of the Rainbow Wahine after his retirement on February 20, 2017. Shoji played collegiate volleyball at the University of California, Santa Barbara, serving as the team's setter and earning All-American honors in 1968 and 1969. Shoji is also a graduate of the University of Hawaii ROTC program. Shoji's elder son, Kawika Shoji, was a 3-year starting setter for the Stanford Cardinal men's volleyball team. During his senior year in 2010 Kawika led Stanford to the 2010 NCAA national championship and was selected as the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) player-of-the-year. Shoji's younger son, Erik Shoji, played as a libero for Stanford's volleyball team. Erik was the first player in AVCA history to earn first-team AVCA honors four years in a row." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jung Joon-young (born February 21, 1989) is a South Korean former singer-songwriter, radio DJ, host, actor, and television personality. Jung first gained recognition in the 2012 season of the musical reality competition television show Superstar K, where he finished in third place. In October 2013 he released his debut mini album, 1st Mini Album, which won him the \"New Male Solo Artist\" award at the 3rd Gaon Chart Music Awards. On June 26, 2014, he released his self-produced 2nd mini album, Teenager. On February 7, 2017, he released his studio album The First Person. From 2015 to March 2019, Jung was the lead vocalist of the rock band JJY Band, which was renamed Drug Restaurant in 2016. In 2013, he joined the KBS2 variety show 2 Days & 1 Night as its youngest member, and would be a cast member on the show until 2019. He hosted his own radio program titled Jung Joon-young's Simsimtapa on MBC FM from 2014 to 2015 and made his film debut in Love Forecast in 2015. In March 2019, Jung retired from the entertainment industry after admitting that he had \"filmed women without their consent and shared it in a chatroom\" in the Jung Joon-young KakaoTalk chatrooms, which were first revealed in the Burning Sun scandal. On November 29, 2019, Jung was sentenced to six years in prison for the rape of multiple drunk unconscious women and the unwitting filming and sharing sexual images of his victims without their consent. The sentence was reduced to five years by the Seoul High Court in May 2020." ;

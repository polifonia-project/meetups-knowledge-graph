        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kevin Adam Curtis (born 26 May 1955) is an English documentary filmmaker. Curtis began his career as a conventional documentary producer for the BBC throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. The release of Pandora's Box (1992) marked the introduction of Curtis's distinctive presentation that uses collage to explore aspects of sociology, psychology, philosophy and political history. His style has been described as involving, \"whiplash digressions, menacing atmospherics and arpeggiated scores, and the near-psychedelic compilation of archival footage\", narrated by Curtis himself with \"patrician economy and assertion\". His films have been awarded with four BAFTAs." ;

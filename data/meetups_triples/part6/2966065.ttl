Born and raised in Albany Creek, Queensland, Lisa and her identical twin sister, Jessica Origliasso, performed in show business at a young age. Origliasso rose to fame in the 2000s when she and her sister formed the pop duo The Veronicas. Prior to The Veronicas, the Origliassos had a small career in acting. In 2001, she had a recurring role alongside her sister in the children's television series Cybergirl as Sapphire Buxton. In 2007, she co-designed a fashion line with her sister, called The Veronicas, aimed at girls aged 7 to 14, for Target. Origliasso has been endorsed by Nu:U, Calvin Klein, Keds and Estée Lauder.

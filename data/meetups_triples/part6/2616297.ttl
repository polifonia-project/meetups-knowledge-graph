As a young prodigy, he started violin studies in Odessa with the eminent pedagogue, Pyotr Stolyarsky and continued them in Moscow Conservatory under Abram Yampolsky and Lev Tseitlin. As a teenager, Boris Goldstein was singled out by Heifetz as being USSR's most brilliant violin talent. His brother was the violinist and composer Mikhail Goldstein. His great uncle was the physicist Eugen Goldstein." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ross Kolby (born 7 November 1970) is a Norwegian visual artist and author. His paintings are often political and reference classical art, historical events and debate contemporary topics. With the use of both modern and classical symbols as well as symbolic persons Kolby has worked with themes like racism, the clerical abuse of children in the Catholic Church and the Anders Behring Breivik 2011 Norway Attacks. He also works extensively with portraits and has among others painted the three generations of Norwegian monarchs involved in the events of WWII, Dame Vera Lynn and Elizabeth II. His paintings have been donated to Norway's Crown Regalia Museum, Norway's Resistance Museum, Royal Norwegian Navy Museum as well as to the Royal Albert Hall. Kolby has also published two novels, a fantasy story about the 12-year-old English boy Will O'Phillie and a historical drama from the witch processes in Northern Norway in the 1600s." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Baji Rao I (18 August 1700 – 28 April 1740), born as Visaji, also known as Bajirao Ballal (Pronunciation: [bad͡ʒiɾaːʋ bəlːaːɭ]), was the 7th Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. During his 20-year tenure as a Peshwa, he defeated Mughals and their vassal Nizam-ul-Mulk at several battles like the Battle of Delhi and Battle of Bhopal. Baji Rao's achievements include establishing Maratha supremacy in southern India and northern India. Thus, he was responsible for establishing Maratha power in Gujarat, Malwa, Rajputana and Bundelkhand and liberating Konkan (western coast of India) from the Siddis of Janjira and Portuguese rule. Baji Rao's relationship with his Muslim wife, a controversial subject, has been adapted in Indian novels and cinema." ;

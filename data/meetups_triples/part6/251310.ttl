        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jill Wendy Dando (9 November 1961 â€“ 26 April 1999) was an English journalist, television presenter and newsreader. She spent most of her career at the BBC and was the corporation's Personality of the Year in 1997. At the time of her death, her television work included co-presenting the BBC One programme Crimewatch with Nick Ross. On the morning of 26 April 1999, Dando was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, southwest London, prompting the biggest murder inquiry conducted by the Metropolitan Police and the country's largest criminal investigation since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. A local man, Barry George, was convicted and imprisoned for the murder, but after eight years in prison he was acquitted following an appeal and retrial. In 2012, the Serbian 'warlord' Arkan was named as a suspect in the case, although he had died in 2000. No other suspect has been charged with Dando's murder, and the case remains unsolved despite police identifying over 2,000 potential suspects." ;

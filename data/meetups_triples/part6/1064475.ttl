        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Jordan (born 15 December 1951) is a Scottish football player, coach and manager. He is currently a first-team coach at AFC Bournemouth. A former striker, he played for Leeds United, Manchester United, and Milan, among others at club level, as well making 52 appearances and scoring 11 goals for Scotland. As a player, he gained a fearsome 'Jaws' persona due to having lost two front teeth early in his career. The persona aside, he became known as a strong, fearless and committed player, with skill to match, and good aerial abilities. He was part of the successful Leeds United team of the 1970s, winning the 1973â€“74 Football League First Division title. Cup success was elusive however, being a losing finalist with Leeds in the 1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final and 1975 European Cup Final, and the 1979 FA Cup Final with Manchester United. At international level he is the only Scottish player to score in three World Cups, in 1974, 1978 and 1982. After retiring from playing, Jordan moved into coaching and management, at a number of clubs, most notably managing Heart of Midlothian in Scotland before later becoming first-team coach at Portsmouth under Harry Redknapp, with whom he has since developed a close working relationship, later following him to Tottenham Hotspur. In coaching and management he is described by Redknapp and others as an enigmatic coach who bears listening to, who has lost none of his 'hard man' reputation as a player. For his efforts for club and country as a player, he was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2005. He is considered a legend among the Tartan Army of Scotland fans, being best remembered for scoring the crucial goal against Czechoslovakia in 1973 which ensured Scotland qualified for their first World Cup finals in 16 years." ;

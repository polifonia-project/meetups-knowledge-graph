        mtp:hasAbstract        "Francisco Guillermo Ochoa Magaña (Spanish pronunciation: [ɡiˈʝeɾmo oˈtʃo.a]; born 13 July 1985), commonly referred to as Memo, is a Mexican professional footballer who is a goalkeeper for Liga MX club América, which he captains, and the Mexico national team. Ochoa made his senior-level professional debut for Club América in 2004 in a Mexican league match against Monterrey. He won his first league title in 2005 and was the club's first-choice goalkeeper up until 2011, making over 200 appearances for América. That summer Ochoa was transferred to Ajaccio in France. He spent three seasons with the club until their relegation from Ligue 1. In 2014, Ochoa joined Málaga but failed to establish himself in the team. In July 2016, he joined Granada on a season-long loan. In July 2017, he joined Standard Liège. He returned to Club América in August 2019. A Mexican international since 2005, Ochoa received his first cap at age 20 in a friendly match against Hungary. Having been included in the squads for the 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup, Ochoa has gained international recognition for his consistency and big game performances in the competition over multiple iterations. He has also appeared at the 2013 and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Olympics, the 2007 Copa América, the Copa América Centenario, the 2007, 2009, 2015, and 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and was originally in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup before being suspended from the competition due to false doping allegations. He is the most capped goalkeeper in the history of the national side, and currently sixth on the all-time list with 133 appearances." ;

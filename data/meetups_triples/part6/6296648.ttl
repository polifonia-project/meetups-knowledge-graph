Born in Tunis, his parents immigrated to France while he was a newborn infant. They settled in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois near Paris. His uncle Nathan, was a famous luth player and interpreter of oriental music. At age 12, Dany Brilliant's family moved to Paris and at 14 his grandfather gave him a guitar. He started performing at various events, including important debut at cabaret \"Aux Trois Maillets\" where he got his artistic name. His adopted name Brillant comes after Jacques Boni, the owner of the cabaret invited him to stage by saying: \"Dany! Sois brillant!\" (Dany! be brilliant!).

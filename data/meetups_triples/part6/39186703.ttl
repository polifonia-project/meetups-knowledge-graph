        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Edward Duggan (born July 15, 1958) is an American lawyer, businessman, and politician serving as the 75th mayor of Detroit, Michigan since 2014. A member of the Democratic Party, Duggan previously served as the Wayne County Prosecutor from 2001 to 2004, and as the deputy county executive of Wayne County from 1987 to 2001. Duggan received national attention following his election in 2013, in part for being the first White mayor of the majority-Black city since Roman Gribbs in the early 1970s, when Detroit's population still had a White majority. Duggan was reelected mayor in 2017 and 2021. He has received an approval rating of over 68%, the highest rating of any mayor of Detroit." ;

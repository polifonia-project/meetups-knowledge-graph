        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sir Gerald Hubert Edward Busson du Maurier (26 March 1873 – 11 April 1934) was an English actor and manager. He was the son of author George du Maurier and his wife, Emma Wightwick, and the brother of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. In 1903, he married the actress Muriel Beaumont, with whom he had three daughters: writers Angela du Maurier (1904–2002) and Daphne du Maurier (1907–1989), and painter Jeanne du Maurier (1911–1997). His popularity was due to his subtle and naturalistic acting: a \"delicately realistic style of acting that sought to suggest rather than to state the deeper emotions\". His Times obituary said of his career: \"His parentage assured him of engagements in the best of company to begin with; but it was his own talent that took advantage of them.\"" ;

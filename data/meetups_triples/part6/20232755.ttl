        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Michael Nicholson (born 10 May 1979) is an English former professional darts player who played in events of the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). He won a major event, the 2010 Players Championship Finals, where he defeated Mervyn King in the final. He was also the runner-up to Phil Taylor in the 2011 Championship League Darts, and part of the Australia team which lost a sudden death shoot-out to England in the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts final. Nicholson also acts as a sports commentator and TV and radio pundit. He was nicknamed \"The Asset\", and was known for coming on to the stage with sunglasses, and was also known for his Wrestling-style walk ons, using the song \"Club Foot\" as his walk on music for most of his career. Nicholson had a feud with Phil Taylor during the 2011 UK Open, in which he supposedly \"waved goodbye\" to Taylor after beating him in a sudden death leg to reach the quarter-finals." ;

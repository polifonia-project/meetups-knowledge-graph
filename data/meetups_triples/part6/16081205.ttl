A remix of M.I.A.'s \"Paper Planes\" was uploaded onto her MySpace featuring Afrikan Boy and tourmate Rye Rye. Afrikan Boy has never appeared on pirate radio, a performance opportunity common in the grime genre. He studied for a Psychology degree at Brunel University. Touring in support of M.I.A. on her 2007 KALA Tour and 2008 People Vs. Money Tour as well as headlining his own shows, Afrikan Boy has appeared at the Splash! festival.

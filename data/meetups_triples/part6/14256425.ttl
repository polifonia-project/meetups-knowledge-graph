        mtp:hasAbstract        "Steve Binder (born December 12, 1932) is an American producer and director. He found success behind the camera on television shows showcasing music, when he was only in his early 20s. He was also influential in creating music programs with racially and ethnically diverse casts, featuring a variety of musical styles. Binder is arguably best known as director of the T.A.M.I. Show, Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special, and Diana Ross Live in Central Park, in which a torrential thunderstorm passed through minutes into Ross's first set, and the Star Wars Holiday Special. In addition to working with Petula Clark and Elvis, Binder also worked on numerous TV shows and specials with Steve Allen, Soupy Sales, Chevy Chase, Patti LaBelle, Barry Manilow, Wayne Newton, Mac Davis, Liza Minnelli, Pee-Wee Herman, and John Denver." ;

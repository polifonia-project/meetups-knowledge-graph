During this time, this was the equivalent of the modern day manager's position. Before 1934, the team was selected by a committee. Smith was the last person to be a Secretary. Jimmy McMullan was appointed as manager when Billy Smith retired. Smith joined Aston Villa as a 17-year-old in 1910 and remained at the club until his death in 1957. His association with Villa lasted 47 years." ;

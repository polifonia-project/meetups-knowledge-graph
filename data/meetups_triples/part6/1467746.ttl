        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alison Marion Lohman (born September 18, 1979) is an American former actress. Born in Palm Springs, California, she began her career with small roles in short and independent films. Lohman headlined the drama film White Oleander (2002), which earned her recognition and a Young Hollywood Award. Lohman earned praise for her performances in the black comedy film Matchstick Men (2003), which won her the Hollywood Film Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the fantasy film Big Fish (2003). She lent her voice to the cult-animated film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (2005), and starred in the television sitcom Tucker (2000–2001) and the critically acclaimed soap opera Pasadena (2001–2002). Lohman sporadically worked in acting throughout the late 2000s, notably playing roles in the action film Beowulf (2007) and the drama film Things We Lost in the Fire (2007). Her highest-grossing film came with the horror film Drag Me to Hell (2009), which earned her nominations for the Detroit Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress, the Saturn Award for Best Actress, and the MTV Movie Award for Best Scared-As-Shit Performance. In 2009, Lohman announced her retirement from acting following her marriage to director, producer and screenwriter Mark Neveldine, with whom she has three children. She has participated in three of Neveldine's projects with cameo roles." ;

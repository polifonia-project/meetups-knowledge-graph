        mtp:hasAbstract        "Byron Wallen (born July 1969) is a British jazz trumpeter, composer and educator. He was described by Jazzwise as \"one of the most innovative, exciting and original trumpet players alive\". As characterised by All About Jazz, \"He does not fit into any pigeonhole, however, and is also something of a renaissance man: he has long been involved in cognitive psychology and also travels widely, spending extended periods in South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Morocco, Indonesia and Belize (his parents' homeland).\"" ;

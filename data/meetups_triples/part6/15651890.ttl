Though he ultimately underwent bankruptcy, he was a significant contributor to the shape of the city. Roger Sale, in his book Seattle, Past to Present, described him as having been \"the pioneer to turn to if one had a plan that would be 'good for Seattle', and one needed a respectable tone and a willing investor.\"" ;

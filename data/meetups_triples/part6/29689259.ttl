His videos feature him playing various games with fellow artist Dave Brown (\"Boyinaband\") and fellow YouTube personalities such as Michelle 'The RPG Minx', Markiplier, and Adam Montoya. Bull's music was featured in the British press as part of attempts to save BBC Radio 6, campaign against the Digital Economy Bill, and protest in favour of filesharing. He was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which is referenced in some of his songs, such as \"A Portrait of the Autist\"." ;

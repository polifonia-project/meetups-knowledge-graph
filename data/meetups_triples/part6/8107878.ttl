        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sut Jhally (b. 1955) is a professor of communication at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, whose work focuses on cultural studies, advertising, media, and consumption. He is the producer of over 40 documentaries on media literacy topics and the founder and executive director of the Media Education Foundation. The Media Education Foundation (MEF) is a non-profit established in 1992 which \"produces and distributes documentary films and other educational resources to inspire critical reflection on the social, political, and cultural impact of American mass media.\" Their aim is to inspire students to think critically and in new ways about the hyper-mediated world around them. Also the author of 6 books and numerous scholarly and popular articles, Jhally is a public speaker and teacher. He has won the \"Distinguished Communist Award\" at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where the student newspaper has also voted him \"Best Professor.\" He has shown his films and lectured at many colleges and universities nationally and internationally. He was named one of New Woman magazine's \"People of the Year\" in 1992. Jhally taught both undergraduate and graduate level courses which focused on media, public relations and propaganda, as well as gender, sex and representation. Jhally, in a speech from 2010 on the threat of advertising, states that \"advertising is the most powerful and sustained system of propaganda in human history and its cumulative cultural and political effects unless very quickly checked will be responsible for destroying the world as we know it. In the process of achieving this the masters of the advertising system, global corporations bent on nothing but private profits, will be responsible for the deaths of millions of people, mostly non-Western. In addition the peoples of the world will be prevented from achieving true happiness. Simply stated our survival as a species is dependent upon minimizing the threat from advertising and the commercial culture that has spawned it.\" Jhally was born in Kenya, and raised in England. After completing his undergraduate work at the University of York in England, he moved to Canada after accepting a scholarship to the University of Victoria. He continued his studies at Simon Fraser University, where he received his PhD." ;

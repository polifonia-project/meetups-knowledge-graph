        mtp:hasAbstract        "Vince Taylor (14 July 1939 â€“ 28 August 1991), born Brian Maurice Holden, was an English rock and roll singer. As the lead singer of Vince Taylor and His Playboys, sometimes Vince Taylor and The Playboys, he was successful primarily in France and other parts of Continental Europe during the late 1950s and early 1960s, afterwards falling into obscurity amidst personal problems and drug abuse. He is best remembered for his 1959 song \"Brand New Cadillac\", which The Clash covered on their album London Calling. He was among the inspirations for David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust character." ;

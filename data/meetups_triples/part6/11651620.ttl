        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Taylor Price (born August 26, 1985) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. Price was selected first overall in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in September 2008. He has played for the Detroit Tigers, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers. Price pitched as a relief pitcher during the Rays' run through the 2008 playoffs. Weeks after his first appearance in the big leagues, he earned a save in Game 7 of the 2008 American League Championship Series (ALCS), helping the Rays reach their first World Series. Price became a full-time starting pitcher in 2009. In his second full season, he was named the American League starter for the 2010 All-Star Game and finished second in the voting for the 2010 Cy Young Award. He won the award in 2012. The Rays traded Price to the Tigers during the 2014 season. When the Tigers fell out of the postseason race in 2015, they traded him to the Blue Jays, who won their division and advanced to the ALCS. That following off-season, the Red Sox signed Price to a franchise-record seven-year, $217 million contract. At the time, it was the largest contract total for a pitcher in Major League history. He won the series-clinching Game 5 as the Red Sox won the 2018 World Series over the Dodgers. The Red Sox traded him to the Dodgers after the 2019 season. He was part of the Los Angeles Dodgers team that won the 2020 World Series, although he didnâ€™t play a single game due to sitting out the COVID-19 pandemic shortened season." ;

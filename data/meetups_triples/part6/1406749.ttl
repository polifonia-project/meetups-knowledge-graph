        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rohail Hyatt HI(M) (Urdu: روحیل حیات) is a Pakistani record producer, keyboardist, and composer. As record producer, Hyatt is largely credited with pioneering Pakistani pop rock music by incorporating western rock and pop influences. In 1986, Hyatt founded the band Vital Signs and released its commercially hit and critically acclaimed album, Vital Signs 1. The first album included the international number-one single \"Dil Dil Pakistan\" and \"Tum Mil Gaye\", which were composed by Hyatt. The big commercial success of Vital Signs' first album helped shape the rock music industry of Pakistan. In 1991, Hyatt produced and released the band's second album, Vital Signs 2, distributed by EMI Pakistan, which received mixed reviews. Between 1993 and 1995, Hyatt garnered recognition and critical acclaims for composing the two best-selling albums which improved the recognition of his work in the music industry. In 1998, Hyatt discontinued Vital Signs after facing various issues, leaving Junaid Jamshed to focus on his solo career. Hyatt later founded Pyramid Productions which subsequently emerged as one of the most prominent music production companies of Pakistan, and produced a ghazal album featuring Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. In 2007, he composed the soundtrack of highly critical acclaimed and internationally successful film, Khuda Kay Liye, which helped promote his work within the country as well as internationally. In 2008, Hyatt founded the international music outlet, Coke Studio, and he is credited with featuring both established as well as upcoming Pakistani artists through the platform." ;

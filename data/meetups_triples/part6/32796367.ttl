        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Erskine Wade Copland-Crawford (5 September 1852 â€“ 23 May 1894) was a Scottish soldier and amateur sportsman. He played football four times for Scotland in the representative matches played between 1870 and 1872, scoring the opening goal in the first match. He also played first class cricket for M.C.C. in 1872 and 1873. He served in the Afghan War from 1878 to 1880, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was later a police-officer in Sierra Leone, but ended his career in disgrace when he was imprisoned for causing the death of a native by flogging." ;

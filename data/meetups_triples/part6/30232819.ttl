        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alec Andon, professionally known as Alec Monopoly, is a street artist originally from New York City. His signature is covering his face with his hand or using a medical face mask to hide his facial identity. His claim to fame is the use of the Parker Brothers legendary board game Monopoly character \"Mr. Monopoly\" (today part of the Hasbro brand). The artist has also worked in the urban environments of Miami, Los Angeles, Europe, Mexico, and throughout Asia using varied materials (including stencils, spray paint, epoxies, varnishes, and newspapers) to depict various iconic pop culture characters. He also is a brand ambassador with Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer and created a mural live, on red carpet for the 2013 film, Justin Bieber's Believe. Monopoly's work has been purchased by such notable people as Philipp Plein, Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen, Adrien Brody, and Iggy Azalea, among others." ;

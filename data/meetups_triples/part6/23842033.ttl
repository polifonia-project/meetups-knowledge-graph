        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ivan Gough (born 19 May 1969) is an Australian house music producer and DJ. His first release, a remix of Pendulums \"I Need You\" became an instant club anthem, being played by the likes of Paul Oakenfold and Pete Tong in the United Kingdom. He released various tracks throughout the late 1990s and was an influential producer in the Melbourne underground scene working with \"Zero Tolerance\" recordings running their CBD studio. In 2004, he and fellow Melbourne DJ Grant Smillie began the production outfit TV Rock and toured with the Future Music Festival in 2010. Gough left TV Rock early in 2013 to pursue solo projects." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Richard Duffy (born December 21, 1988) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals. After being drafted by the Royals in 2007, Duffy spent the next several years in the Royals' minor league system, and represented the team in the 2009 All-Star Futures Game. However, personal issues led Duffy to temporarily retire from baseball in 2010, although he returned to the Royals later that year. Duffy made his MLB debut in 2011. After his rookie season, Duffy did not pitch in MLB on a regular basis again until 2014. He was a member of the Royals' pitching staffs during the team's successful 2014 and 2015 seasons, and won a World Series championship with the Royals in 2015. Duffy had a career year in 2016, setting career highs in many statistical categories. After the 2016 season, Duffy signed a $65 million extension to remain with the Royals. The Royals traded Duffy to the Dodgers during the 2021 season, but due to injury, he has yet to appear in an MLB game for the Dodgers." ;

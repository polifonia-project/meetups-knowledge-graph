        mtp:hasAbstract        "Samuel Levinson (born January 8, 1985) is an American actor and filmmaker. He is the son of Academy Award-winning director Barry Levinson. In 2010, he received his first writing credit as a co-writer for the action comedy film Operation: Endgame. The following year, he made his directorial film debut with Another Happy Day (2011), which premiered at Sundance Film Festival. He then received a writing credit on his father's HBO television film The Wizard of Lies (2017). He continued writing and directing for the feature films Assassination Nation (2018) and Malcolm & Marie (2021). In 2019, Levinson created the HBO teen drama series Euphoria which was adapted from the Israeli series of the same name. The series has become popular with audiences, while gaining significant criticism for its explicit content involving teens, particularly its portrayal of teenage sexuality. Levinson was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards for the series." ;

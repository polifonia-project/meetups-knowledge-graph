In spite of their original reputation as fine blades favored by the shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu and his vassals, the katana swords made by Muramasa gradually became a symbol of the anti-Tokugawa movement.Furthermore, in lore and popular culture from the 18th century, the swords have been regarded as yōtō (妖刀, \"wicked katana\")." ;

His father Andrei Khrzhanovsky (b. 1939) is one of the top Russian animation directors, and his mother Mariya Neyman, a philologist and script editor. He is the grandson of artist and actor (1905—1987). In 2006 Khrzhanovsky launched the DAU project and has since been producing and directing films and other products for it. Since 2007 Khrzhanovsky has permanently resided outside of Russia, in Germany, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Lowell Moore Jr. (October 31, 1925 â€“ February 21, 2008) was an American writer who wrote The Green Berets, The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy, and with Xaviera Hollander and Yvonne Dunleavy, The Happy Hooker: My Own Story. Moore co-authored the lyrics for the \"Ballad of the Green Berets\", which was one of the major hit songs of 1966. The song was featured in the 1968 film The Green Berets, based on Moore's book, which starred John Wayne. A new edition of The Green Berets was published in April 2007, and his last book, Wars of the Green Berets, co-authored with Col. Mike 'Doc' Lennon, was released in June 2007. Moore was convicted of tax fraud in 1986. At the time of his death, he was living in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, home to Fort Campbell and the 5th Special Forces Group, where he was working on his memoirs and three other books." ;

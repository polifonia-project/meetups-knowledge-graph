She and her band performed on the New York Club circuit such as Max's Kansas City and CBGB's during the 1970s]. Reyner also did film starring in Heaven Wants Out by director Robert Feinberg in 1970. Reyner was included among Warhol Factory denizens, artists and superstars and modeled for photographer Francesco Scavullo for his photo book Scavullo: Francesco Scavullo Photographs 1948â€“1984. She also modeled for Leee Black Childers, who included her in his 130 Fabulous Faces. Throughout the 1970s Reyner continued performing with her band on the downtown glam punk rock scene in NYC until experiencing a serious illness in 1982 which suspended her career for several years. It wasn't until the 1990s that she returned to music and performance continuing until today. Reyner last directed, performed and produced her play Singin'in the ER in Fall 2019 at Theater for the New City in New York City." ;

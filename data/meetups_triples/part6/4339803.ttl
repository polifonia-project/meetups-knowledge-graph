She has been published in a variety of media, including The Wall Street Journal. She served as the director of the \"Islam and Democracy Project\" and as a senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think-tank based in Washington, DC. She is the founder and executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Islamic Pluralism. In 2011â€“2012 she was a member of Folks Magazine's Editorial Board. She has been an adherent of the Hanafi school of Islam since 1997. She was a major intellectual figure in the neo-conservative movement that held considerable influence in the administration of George W. Bush. Her criticism of Islamic Fundamentalism, especially the Wahhabi sect of Sunni Islam, has attracted controversy. Alongside fellow neo-conservative writer Daniel Pipes, Schwartz has been a major critic of Islamism; which she accuse of being the new ideological nemesis of the West after the fall of Nazi Germany and Soviet Union. Schwartz is a major critic of the AKP government in Turkey, considering it as a hostile pan-Islamist threat and calls for US government to cut ties with Turkey. She has also condemned the Islamic Republic of Iran stating that American academia is under threat of infiltration by radical Islamist state agents of Iran." ;

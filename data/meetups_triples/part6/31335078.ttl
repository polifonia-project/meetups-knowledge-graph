        mtp:hasAbstract        "Barry Morton Gough is a global maritime and naval historian recognized for the range and quality of his body of work and his influence in the wider good of the profession. He is an accomplished biographer, having written the lives of such diverse persons as the mariner Juan de Fuca, the fur trading organizer Peter Pond, and the intrepid trans-continental explorer Sir Alexander Mackenzie. As an historiographer, he has examined the lives of rival British naval historians Arthur Marder and Captain Stephen Roskill, and more recently, as an analyst of British naval history, has written the interlocking lives of the titans at the admiralty, Admiral Lord Fisher and Prime Minister Winston Spencer Churchill, whose work was essential to Britain's maintenance of sea supremacy in the First World War. Gough has made a number of monographic contributions to ethnohistory, cross-cultural relations, patterns of missionary acceptance among Northwest Coast peoples, frontierâ€“borderland studies and environmental history. With the perspective of British sea power worldwide,he has set out the maritime dimensions of British Columbia history and has worked to recast and reaffirm the imperial foundations of Canadian history." ;

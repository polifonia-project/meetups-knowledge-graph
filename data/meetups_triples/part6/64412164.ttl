        mtp:hasAbstract        "Annamie Paul (born November 3, 1972) is a Canadian activist, lawyer, and former politician who served as the leader of the Green Party of Canada from 2020 to 2021. She was the first Black Canadian and first Jewish woman to be elected leader of a federal party in Canada. Paul had previously founded the Canadian Centre for Political Leadership, and served as its executive director from 2001 to 2005, before serving in civic engagement and international affairs positions, including in political affairs in Canada's Mission to the European Union and in the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court. First standing for election in the 2019 Canadian federal election for Toronto Centre, Paul became Green Party leader in 2020, winning the Green Party of Canada leadership election to replace Elizabeth May. Running in the 2020 Toronto Centre federal by-election, Paul was defeated by Liberal nominee Marci Ien, again in 2021, which made her the only federal party leader who was not an MP, but whose party had representation in the House of Commons. In the 2021 Canadian federal election, the Greens under Paul maintained two seats, and Paul finished fourth in the Toronto Centre district. On September 27, 2021, Paul began the process of resignation as party leader, and she ceased being party leader by November 14." ;

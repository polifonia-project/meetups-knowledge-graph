She is a former AEW Women's World Champion. She was trained by Emi Sakura and debuted for her Ice Ribbon promotion in May 2006, at the age of nine. She would work for the promotion for the next six years, becoming its first Triple Crown Champion, having won the ICE×60 Championship, the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship and the Triangle Ribbon Championship once each. She also became a Jiyūgaoka 6-Person Tag Team, Sea Of Japan 6-Person Tag Team and UWA World Trios Champion, unifying the three titles in July 2010, teaming with The Great Kojika and Mr. #6. Riho left Ice Ribbon in September 2012 to join Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling, a new promotion founded by Sakura, who had left Ice Ribbon the previous January. In November 2014, Riho won the IWA Triple Crown Championship. In May 2019, Riho began making appearances for AEW. She defeated Nyla Rose to become the inaugural AEW Women's World Champion, holding the title for 133 days before Rose defeated her at Revolution. Riho also began appearing in World Wonder Ring Stardom, working in conjunction with her AEW commitments. She won the High Speed Championship in her first match for the promotion, and held the title for 351 days, dropping it to AZM in July 2020." ;

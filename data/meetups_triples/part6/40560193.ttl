In June 2017, Starnes began hosting a syndicated talk radio show on Fox News Radio. In October 2019, he was fired from Fox News and all affiliates after he endorsed the notion that American Democrats worship a pagan god, Moloch. In January 2020, Starnes, via his Starnes Media Group, purchased Memphis talk station 990 AM KWAM and translator 107.9 W300DE from for $685,000. KWAM will be the flagship station for Starnes' radio show." ;

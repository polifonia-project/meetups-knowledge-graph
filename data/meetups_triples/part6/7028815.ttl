        mtp:hasAbstract        "Aaron McLean (born 25 May 1983) is an English retired professional footballer who played as a striker. At international level he gained five caps for the England C team during his time in the non-league. McLean began his senior career with Leyton Orient in 1999, having graduated from the club's youth ranks. Never really breaking into the first team, he made 40 league appearances in a four-year spell, which also included a brief loan to Grays Athletic. He switched to Aldershot Town in 2003, and, after making 68 league appearances, moved again to Grays Athletic in 2005. He quickly became a regular player for Grays, making 59 league appearances before switching to Peterborough United in 2006; initially on loan, which became permanent the following year. He was a regular for Peterborough, and made 148 league appearances before moving to Hull City in January 2011. Initially a regular player for Hull, he fell out of favour following the club's promotion to the Premier League, and moved on loan to Ipswich Town and then Birmingham City in 2013. In January 2014 McLean completed a move to Bradford City." ;

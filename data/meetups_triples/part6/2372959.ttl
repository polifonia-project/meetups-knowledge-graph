        mtp:hasAbstract        "Adam Seth Gardner (born May 31, 1973) is an American guitarist and vocalist of the band Guster and a member of the Tufts University Beelzebubs. Gardner grew up outside Morristown, New Jersey, and played for a band called Royal Flush while a student at the Pingry School, from which he graduated in 1991. He also attended Harding Township School in New Vernon, New Jersey. Gardner, working with Dave Schneider, created a side-project in 2005 called The LeeVees. Its album, Hanukkah Rocks, consists of humorous original songs about the Jewish holiday. After living in Brooklyn near the other members of Guster for a time, Gardner relocated to Maine. Gardner broadcasts a weekly radio show in Portland, Maine where he discusses everything from music to environmental issues." ;

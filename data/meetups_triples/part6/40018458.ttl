        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Hopkins (1728?–1799), of Oving, Buckinghamshire, was an English politician. He was the eldest son of Edward Hopkins of Coventry, whom he succeeded in 1736, and was educated at Lincoln's Inn (1739) and Queens' College, Cambridge (1746). He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Dartmouth on 7 February 1766 – 1780 and 1784–1790; for Thetford in 1780–1784; for Queenborough in 1790–1796; and for Harwich in 1796 – 19 March 1799. He was a Clerk of the Green Cloth (1767–1777), a Lord of the Admiralty (1782–1783 and 1784–1791) and a Lord of the Treasury (1791–1797). He died unmarried on 18 March 1799 and was buried in the Parish Church of St. Michael, Coventry, as were his parents and paternal grandparents. The church contained plaques commemorating these family members, and flat stones marked their burial places. As Coventry Cathedral, the church was destroyed during World War II." ;

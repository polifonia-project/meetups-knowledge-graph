        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gylve Fenris Nagell (born Gylve Nagell; November 28, 1971), better known as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician, part-time music journalist and online radio host (with the show \"Radio Fenriz\") who is best known as being one half of the extreme metal duo Darkthrone, alongside Nocturno Culto. Although primarily a drummer and songwriter, he has also played bass, guitar and done vocals for Darkthrone and several other metal bands. Fenriz is famed for his encyclopedic knowledge of metal music, his eager promotion of underground bands and the DIY ethic, and his rejection of the \"showbiz side of the music industry\". Fenriz was also the studio drummer for doom metal band Valhall, and has had several solo projects, including the folk black metal project Isengard and the dark ambient project Neptune Towers." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dennis John Kucinich (/kuːˈsɪnɪtʃ/; born October 8, 1946) is an American politician. A U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1997 to 2013, he was also a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2004 and 2008. He ran for governor of Ohio in the 2018 election, losing in the primary to Richard Cordray. From 1977 to 1979, Kucinich served as the 53rd mayor of Cleveland, a tumultuous term in which he survived a recall election and was successful in a battle against selling the municipal electric utility before being defeated for reelection by George Voinovich. Due to redistricting following the 2010 state elections, Ohio's 10th congressional district was redrawn in southern Ohio. Kucinich faced Representative Marcy Kaptur in the 2012 race for the U.S. House, Ohio's 9th congressional district having absorbed part of Cuyahoga County. Kaptur defeated Kucinich. In January 2013, he became a contributor on the Fox News Channel appearing on programs such as The O'Reilly Factor. Kucinich was also an unsuccessful primary candidate in the 2021 Cleveland mayoral election." ;

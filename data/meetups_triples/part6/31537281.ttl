Well known in her country for her involvement with environmental organizations, Mariana has the honor to be the godmother of OCC (Organization of Conservation of the cetaceans[1] (whales and dolphins) of the South Atlantic and the River de la Plata). She has made a recording of her children songs (\"El Planeta Sonoro\"), for the benefit of Aldeas Infantiles SOS, the international orphans' organization. Mariana is also the creator of healing spaces through individual and group singing (\"Sonando y Sanando\", \"Afinando el Instrumento\"). She has done workshops for actors, dancers, therapists, musicians and educators, as much in Uruguay as in Spain. She also has created many educational music programs for children. She has also worked as musical producer for the first CD of ceremonial songs of the Shuar Indians, descendants of the Jibaros of the Ecuatorial Amazonia, interpreted by Medicine men. This recording has been for the benefit of their community. Her work has also included musicological exploration of Afro-Uruguayan music, Afro-Brazilian music, Afro-Cuban music, the sacred music of the Native Americans of South, Central, and North America, and the sacred music of India. She also has coordinated healing workshops through laughter called \"The Laughter of Being\" and \"The Sacred Laughter\". For the last two years she has been traveling around the world interviewing artists, teachers, therapists and common people for a non-profit documentary called \"Tuning the Instrument\". Up until now this documentary has been filmed in India, France, Portugal, Spain, Uruguay and Brazil. Nowadays, she is recording with Kit Walker, two albums at the same time." ;

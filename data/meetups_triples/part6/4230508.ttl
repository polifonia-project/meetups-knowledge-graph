        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ibrahim Moustafa (Arabic: ابراهيم مصطفى, 23 September 1904 – 9 October 1968) was a Greco-Roman wrestler from Egypt. At his first international tournament, the 1924 Olympics, he finished fourth in the light-heavyweight category. Four years later he won the gold medal in this event, becoming the second Egyptian Olympic champion after Sayed Nosseir. Next year, upon invitation from the Swedish Wrestling Federation, Moustafa toured Europe and competed in several international tournaments. A carpenter by profession, upon returning home he became a wrestling coach, and prepared one of his three sons, Adel Ibrahim Moustafa, for the 1948 and 1952 Olympics. After his death, the annual Ibrahim Moustafa International Tournament was carried out in his honor." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jay Blotcher (born 1960) is an American activist, journalist, and editor. He was active in the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in its early years, serving as chair of the media committee, and was a founding member of Queer Nation. Blotcher later worked as a publicist for the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) and the Culinary Institute of America, as well as co-founding a public relations firm that specialized in representing progressive groups and individuals. His work has appeared in both mainstream and LGBTQ publications, including The New York Times, the Advocate, Out, POZ, Gay City News, and LGNY. In 2004, Blotcher and his longtime partner were among the first same-sex couples to be married in the state of New York when New Paltz mayor Jason West wed twenty-five couples in front of the village hall in a ceremony later challenged in court." ;

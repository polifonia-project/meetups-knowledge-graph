She worked with her husband Edward Holland Spicer (known as \"Ned\") who was a very well known anthropologist who authored many books which included the book which she had jointly edited titled People of Pascua (1988) which included a section by her titled Living in Pascua, Looking Back Fifty Years. Edward H. and Rosamond B. Spicer Foundation has been established by the family members of the Spicer family and anthropologists in Arizona in honour of Ned and Roz Spicer, as they were popularly known, in the field of applied anthropology. This Foundation, associated with the Arizona State Museum, is engaged in making use of the archive of Spicerâ€™s work which Roz Spicer had compiled after death of Ned to enable further \"applied research and practice in anthropology.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bethany Beardslee (born December 25, 1925) is an American soprano particularly noted for her collaborations with major 20th-century composers, such as Igor Stravinsky, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, George Perle, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and her performances of great contemporary classical music by Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern. Her legacy amongst midcentury composers was as a \"composer's singer\"â€”for her commitment to the highest art of new music. Milton Babbitt said of her \"She manages to learn music no one else in the world can. She can work, work, work.\" In a 1961 interview for Newsweek, Beardslee flaunted her unflinching repertoire and disdain for commercialism: \"I don't think in terms of the public... Music is for the musicians. If the public wants to come along and study it, fine. I don't go and try to tell a scientist his business because I don't know anything about it. Music is just the same way. Music is not entertainment.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jyothi was an Indian actress who appeared in South Indian films. She acted in over 50 films. She is known for films like Puthukavithai and Rail Payanangalil. Jyothi made a mark in acting through Vijaya T. Rajendher's Rayil Payanangalil and Rajinikanth starrer Puthu Kavithai. Jyothi died of breast cancer at a private hospital in Chennai in 2007. She was 44. A divorcee, Jothi was staying with her daughter at suburban Neelangarai on the ECR and getting treatment for the last couple of years. She shot into the limelight when her maiden film \"Rayil Payanangalil\", directed by Vijaya T Rajendher, turned out to be a resounding success. She had also paired with Tamil Superstar Rajnikanth in \"Pudukavithai\", produced by Kavithalayaas in the mid-80s. A host of people from the Tamil film world paid their last respects to the actor, who had acted in over 50 films in Tamil and Telugu. Her body was cremated at Besant Nagar crematorium." ;

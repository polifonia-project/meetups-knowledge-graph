        mtp:hasAbstract        "Barbara Tyson (born October 1, 1964) is a Canadian actress known for appearing in hit TV series Neon Rider, Cold Squad, ER and The Twilight Zone. One of her first notable television roles was in Another World as Dawn \"Ivy\" Rollo, the first HIV-positive character to be introduced in a daytime soap opera in the United States. She was credited as Barbara Bush in her early roles. Originally from Capreol, Ontario, she moved with her mother several times in childhood after her parents' divorce, finally spending her teen years in Barrie, Ontario. Her first-ever acting audition was for a role in the Donald Sutherland film Threshold, which went to Mare Winningham. She had early guest roles in Canadian television, and appeared as Carol Burnett's daughter in the television film Between Friends, before moving to New York City in 1985. She had just $1.87 in her savings account the day she won her role in Another World. After that role ended, she continued to appear in guest roles before securing her starring role in the Canadian series Neon Rider, which lasted for four seasons. She was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Guest Performance in a Series by an Actor or Actress in 1994 for a guest appearance in North of 60." ;

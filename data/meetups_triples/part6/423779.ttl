        mtp:hasAbstract        "Steve Davis OBE (born 22 August 1957) is an English retired professional snooker player who is currently a commentator, musician, DJ, and author. He is best known for dominating professional snooker during the 1980s, when he reached eight World Snooker Championship finals in nine years, won six world titles, and held the world number one ranking for seven consecutive seasons. He was runner-up to Dennis Taylor in one of snooker's most famous matches, the 1985 world final, whose dramatic black-ball conclusion attracted 18.5 million viewers, setting UK records for any broadcast after midnight and any broadcast on BBC Two that stand to this day. In addition to his six world titles, Davis won the UK Championship six times and the Masters three times for a total of 15 Triple Crown titles, placing him third on the all-time list behind Ronnie O'Sullivan (21) and Stephen Hendry (18). During the 1987–88 season, he became the first player to win all three Triple Crown events in a single season, a feat only Hendry and Mark Williams have since emulated. His career total of 28 ranking titles places him fourth on the all-time list behind O'Sullivan (39), Hendry (36), and John Higgins (31). The first player to make an officially recognised maximum break in professional competition, and the first to earn £1 million in career prize money, Davis was named the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year in 1988 and remains the only snooker player to win the award. Although he won his last major title at the 1997 Masters, he competed at a high level into his 50s, making his last Crucible appearance in 2010, when he defeated the defending world champion John Higgins to become the oldest world quarter-finalist since 1983. He retired in April 2016 after 38 seasons on the professional tour, but he remains active as a commentator and analyst for the BBC's snooker coverage. As of 2022, he shares his record of 30 Crucible appearances with O'Sullivan. Outside snooker, Davis competed in nine-ball pool tournaments, most notably representing Europe in the Mosconi Cup eleven consecutive times between 1994 and 2004. A keen chess and poker player, he served as president of the British Chess Federation between 1996 and 2001 and has competed in televised poker tournaments. A fan of progressive rock, he has an ongoing career as a radio broadcaster, club DJ, and musician; with Kavus Torabi and Michael J. York, he co-founded the electronic music band the Utopia Strong. He has authored or co-authored books on snooker, chess, cooking, and music, as well as three autobiographies. In 2013, he featured as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. He was made a MBE in the 1988 Birthday Honours and an OBE in the 2000 New Year Honours." ;

As well as working internationally throughout Europe and the United States, he has performed as a member of numerous bands including the Groop, Axiom, the Bootleg Family Band and in America with Flying Burrito Brothers before carving out a solo career in 1972. He briefly went under the pseudonym of Brian Caine in late 1966, when first joining the Groop. Cadd produced fellow Australian acts Robin Jolley, Ronnie Burns, Broderick Smith, Tina Arena and Glenn Shorrock; and established his own record label called Bootleg Records. He also composed or performed music for the films Alvin Purple, Alvin Purple Rides Again, Fatal Vision, The Return of the Living Dead, Vampires on Bikini Beach, Morning of the Earth and The Heartbreak Kid and for television Class of 74, The Midnight Special and Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. His songwriting for other acts includes The Masters Apprentices, The Bootleg Family Band, Ronnie Burns, The Pointer Sisters, Little River Band and John Farnham. In 2007, Cadd was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. He was awarded in the Queens Birthday Honours in 2018, along with late musician Phil Emmanuel for his 50-year service to the music industry as a singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, mentor and producer and his work in production." ;

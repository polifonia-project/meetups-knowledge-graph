        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tollemache Heriot Eslick (1877–?), more commonly known as T. S. Eslick, who also used the name Thomas Henry Eslick, was a twice-bankrupt showman, prone to exaggeration, who indicated he was an English-born construction engineer specialising in amusement parks and ballrooms. He was given to be a 'bluff and good natured Cornishman with a hearty sense of humour and a ready wit', taller than 6 feet (1.8 m), and of good health. Not much has been independently written of Eslick, and much information derived from newspaper interviews – the entrepreneur indicating in 1914 he was born in India, contrasting with his usual stated English origins." ;

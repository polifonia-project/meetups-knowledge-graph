After leaving school at the age of fifteen, Cussick formed several local bands, with moderate success.

He was the singer and bassist of Lake until 1974 and again in the year 2002. Two years later, he was a member of Linda and the Funky Boys, who scored a hit with the early disco song \"Shame Shame Shame\", which sold around six million singles. Ian Cussick went on to record twelve solo albums, two EP's and four Live albums over a period of thirty years. The most famous songs are \"Meet Me by the Water\", \"Wonderlove\", a homage to Stevie Wonder, and \"The Supernatural\".

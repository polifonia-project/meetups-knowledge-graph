        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rick \"Rick the Bass Player\" Rosas (September 10, 1949 â€“ November 6, 2014) was an American musician, and one of the most sought after studio session musicians in Los Angeles. Though largely known for his long collaboration with Neil Young, throughout his career he also played with Joe Walsh, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Rivers, Ron Wood, Etta James, and the short-lived reunion of the Buffalo Springfield, among others. He performed as a bass player with The Flash in Jonathan Demme's 2015 film Ricki and The Flash. The band was composed of guitarist Rick Springfield, drummer Joe Vitale, and keyboardist Bernie Worrell, backing up Meryl Streep, as \"Ricki\", on vocals and guitar. In 2014, Rosas joined Neil Young and Crazy Horse on their European tour, following Billy Talbot's inability to tour due to a stroke. This makes Rosas the only bassist to have played with three of Young's major bands, Buffalo Springfield, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Crazy Horse." ;

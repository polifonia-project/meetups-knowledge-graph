He was awarded a joint Nobel Prize in Literature in 1974 together with fellow Swede Eyvind Johnson \"for writings that catch the dewdrop and reflect the cosmos\". The choice was controversial, as both Martinson and Johnson were members of the academy. He has been called \"the great reformer of 20th-century Swedish poetry, the most original of the writers called 'proletarian'.\"" ;

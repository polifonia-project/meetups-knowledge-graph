        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marcus Reichert (19 June 1948 - 19 January 2022) was an American painter, poet, author, photographer, and film writer/director. He was given his first exhibition of paintings at the age of twenty-one at the Gotham Book Mart and Art Gallery, New York,. In 1990, he was honored with a retrospective organised by the Hatton Gallery of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne which toured in various forms to Glasgow, London, Paris, and the United States. His Crucifixion paintings have been described by Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford, as being among the most disturbing painted in the 20th Century, while the American critic Donald Kuspit has written that both Picasso's and Bacon's pale in comparison. Reichert's neo-noir film Union City, which premiered at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, was described by Lawrence O'Toole, film critic for Time magazine, as \"an unqualified masterpiece.\" Union City is held in the Film Archive of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and his complete film works and his poetry and prose comprise the Marcus Reichert Archive at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Paris." ;

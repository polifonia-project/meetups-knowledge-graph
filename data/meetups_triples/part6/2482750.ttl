She represented Australia at four successive Summer Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000, Athens 2004, and Beijing 2008. Stubbs has recorded more doubles triumphs than any other Australian woman—60 from 1992 to the conclusion of the 2010 WTA Tour—enjoying success with eleven different partners. In 2001, Stubbs won the season-ending WTA Championships with regular partner Lisa Raymond and the pair were named ITF World Champions. Stubbs is the longest-serving member of the Australia Fed Cup team, having played for 17 years since 1992, with a 28–9 win–loss record in doubles; the second highest in Australian Fed Cup Team history behind Wendy Turnbull (29–8). She retired from Fed Cup play after the 2011 Fed Cup tie with Italy. Stubbs played on the WTA Tour for the rest of 2011 mostly with Casey Dellacqua and played her last tour match at the 2011 US Open with Dellacqua. She then finished her career winning the World TeamTennis title for the third time with the Washington Kastles, her fifth overall WTT title. Stubbs transitioned from her playing days immediately into a successful television career as a commentator and host for TV Networks including, ESPN, Tennis Channel and Channel Seven Australia.

Originally, she was only expected to finish out the 2019 season with Stosur, however, given the success of Stosur at the end of 2019, the pair have decided to continue on in 2020, starting in Australia. With Stubbs as her coach, Stosur won a Grand Slam, the 2021 U.S. Open doubles, with playing partner Zhang Shuai. Stubbs also coached Genie Bouchard throughout 2020 where Bouchard improved her ranking from 330 to 120 on the WTA rankings.

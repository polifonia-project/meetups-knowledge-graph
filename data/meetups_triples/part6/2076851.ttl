        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chan Woods (born Beverly Delores Berg, also known as Chan Richardson; 29 June 1925 â€“ 9 September 1999), was a common-law wife of jazz musician Charlie Parker. She later married musician Phil Woods. She was born in New York City to an inter-religious couple; her father, a producer of vaudeville shows, was Jewish, while her mother, a dancer in Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic, was not. Adopting the name \"Chan Richardson,\" Parker became a nightclub dancer. An early jazz enthusiast, she was romantically connected in the 1940s and early 1950s with jazz musicians Johnny Bothwell and later Don Lanphere. Chan met Charlie Parker in the 1940s, but their friendship did not become romantic until around 1950. Chan and Charlie lived together in a common law relationship on New York's Lower East Side for the last five years of Charlie's life, from 1950 to 1955, although Charlie had not formally terminated a prior marriage. Chan already had one child, her daughter Kim, at the time they established their household; together, Chan and Charlie had had two more children, Baird and Pree. Although they never legally wed, Chan took Charlie's surname, as did all the children. Their relationship was dealt a severe blow with the 1953 death of their 2-1/2 year old daughter, Pree, from pneumonia related to a congenital heart defect." ;

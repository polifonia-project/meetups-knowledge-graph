He belongs to the sixth generation of musicians from the Dharwad Gharana. His father, the late Ustad Abdul Karim Khan was a distinguished sitarist at his time, and his grandfather who was awarded the 'Sitar Ratna', Rahimat Khan was accredited for adding the base octave to the sitar and for modifying the three-string sitar to the seven-string instrument that is common today. Khan is the younger brother of Ustad Bale Khan and Chhote Rahimat Khan and has a twin brother, Shafique Khan, also a sitarist." ;

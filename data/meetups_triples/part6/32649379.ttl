        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gabrielle Ann Aplin (born c. October 1992) is an English singer-songwriter. After amassing a following for her acoustic music covers on YouTube, Aplin signed a recording deal with Parlophone in February 2012. She rose to prominence the following November when she was selected to record the soundtrack for a John Lewis television commercial with a cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's \"The Power of Love\", which went on to top the UK Singles Chart. Her debut album, English Rain, was released in May 2013 to positive reviews. It debuted at number two on the UK Album Chart and led to more singles: \"Please Don't Say You Love Me\", \"Panic Cord\", \"Home\" and \"Salvation\". English Rain has since been certified Gold in the UK, selling over 100,000 copies. Aplin's second album, Light Up the Dark, was released in September 2015, followed by the release of her third album, Dear Happy, in January 2020. She has also released multiple extended plays throughout her career." ;

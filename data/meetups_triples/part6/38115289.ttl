        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lucas Hedges (born December 12, 1996) is an American actor. A son of filmmaker Peter Hedges, he studied theater at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. Hedges began his acting career with a supporting role in Wes Anderson's comedy-drama Moonrise Kingdom (2012). He had his breakthrough in 2016 playing a sardonic teenager in Kenneth Lonergan's drama Manchester by the Sea, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Hedges then starred as an aggressive youth in an off-Broadway production of Yen and had supporting roles in the coming-of-age film Lady Bird and the drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017. In 2018, Hedges played the lead role of a teenager forced into a gay conversion therapy program in Boy Erased, which earned him a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Drama. He also made his Broadway debut in a revival of Lonergan's drama The Waverly Gallery in the same year." ;

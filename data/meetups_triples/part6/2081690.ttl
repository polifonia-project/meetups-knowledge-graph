He was one of the screenwriters who were blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950s because of their suspected communist sympathy or membership in the Communist Party. He once said his most common theme was \"the struggle of the individual against a society that for one reason or another is hostile.\" He elaborated that \"the stories that work best for me involve a loner, out of step or in direct conflict with a group of people.\"" ;

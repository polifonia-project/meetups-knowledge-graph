        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joanne Catherall (born 18 September 1962) is an English singer who is one of two female vocalists in the English synth-pop band The Human League. In 1980, Catherall was a 17-year-old school girl when she and her best friend Susan Ann Sulley were discovered in Sheffield's Crazy Daisy Nightclub by Philip Oakey, the lead singer and a founding member of the Human League. The pair then joined Oakey in forming a new and subsequently commercially successful band line-up. Catherall has remained in the band ever since, working constantly over the next 30 years. She is a joint business partner in the band, which continues to record and tour." ;

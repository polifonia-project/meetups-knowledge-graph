        mtp:hasAbstract        "Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor (Russian: Вячеслав Моше Кантор, born on September 8, 1953 in Moscow) is a Russian businessman and philanthropist who has close ties to the Vladimir Putin regime in Russia. Kantor heads the Acron Group, one of the leading mineral fertilizer producers and distributors in the world. Kantor was President of the European Jewish Congress, President of the World Holocaust Forum Foundation (WHF), Chairman of the European Jewish Fund (EJF), and Chairman of the World Jewish Congress (WJC) Policy Council. In 2021, Forbes estimated Kantor's net worth at US$7.6 billion and the 630th richest person in the world. The Sunday Times Rich List estimated his wealth at £3.488 billion in 2020. Kantor was sanctioned by the British government in March 2022 the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Consequently University College School has decided to review the name of its sports pavilion which is named after Kantor." ;

She was awarded as Best Female Players of the Year by the BWF in 2010. Wang represented China in the 2012 Summer Olympics and had to forfeit the match in the bronze medal playoff game against Saina Nehwal of India in which she was 21–18, 1–0 up, due to a knee injury. After the Olympics, Wang Xin struggled to get back into competition but was never successful due to the severity of her injury. In 2013, at the age of 28 years, she retired from professional badminton." ;

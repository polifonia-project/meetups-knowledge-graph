        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alois Hitler (born Alois Schicklgruber; 7 June 1837 â€“ 3 January 1903) was an Austrian civil servant in the customs service, and the father of Adolf Hitler, dictator of Germany from 1933 to 1945. Alois Schicklgruber was born out of wedlock. His mother was Maria Schicklgruber, but his biological father remains unknown. This uncertain parentage has led to claims that Alois's third wife, Klara (Adolf's mother), may have also been either Alois's first cousin once removed or his half-niece. Alois married his first wife, Anna, in 1873. In 1876, Alois convinced the Austrian local authorities to acknowledge his deceased stepfather Johann Georg Hiedler as his biological father. This meant that Klara legally became Alois's first cousin once removed. Alois then legally changed his last name to that of his deceased stepfather Johann, but the authorities misspelled the last name as \"Hitler\" for unknown reasons. Also in 1876, while Alois was still married to his second wife Franziska, he hired his relative Klara as a household servant, and began an affair with Klara. Their relationship continued in secrecy until Alois's second wife died and Klara became pregnant, which prompted Alois to marry her in 1885. According to a close friend, Alois was \"awfully rough\" with his wife Klara and \"hardly ever spoke a word to her at home\". Alois treated his children with similar contempt and often beat them." ;

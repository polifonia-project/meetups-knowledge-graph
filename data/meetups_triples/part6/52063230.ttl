        mtp:hasAbstract        "William \"Willy\" Murphy (October 12, 1936â€“March 2, 1976) was an American underground cartoonist and editor. Murphy's humor focused on hippies and the counterculture. His signature character was Arnold Peck the Human Wreck, \"a mid-30s beanpole with wry observations about his own life and the community around him.\" Murphy's solo title was called Flamed-Out Funnies; in addition, he contributed to such seminal underground anthologies as Arcade, Bijou Funnies, and San Francisco Comic Book, as well as the National Lampoon. Murphy's work was of the \"bigfoot\" style of cartooning, with characters having long, droopy noses; and was characterized by strong, humorous writing." ;

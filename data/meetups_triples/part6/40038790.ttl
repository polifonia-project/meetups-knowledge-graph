        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gary Wilson (born 11 August 1985) is an English professional snooker player from Wallsend in North Tyneside, Tyne and Wear. After showing promise from a young age, Wilson turned professional in 2004. He dropped off the tour in 2006 however, and didnâ€™t regain his professional status until 2013. During his time as an amateur, Wilson spent time working as a taxi driver, bar man and in a frozen food factory. Noted for his cue ball control and break building ability, Wilson has won one ranking title, the 2022 Scottish Open, and has finished as runner up at the 2015 China Open and the 2021 British Open. He also reached the semi-final at the 2019 World Championship as a qualifier." ;

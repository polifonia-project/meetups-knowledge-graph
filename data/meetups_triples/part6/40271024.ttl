        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jane Harvey (born Phyllis Taff, January 6, 1925, Jersey City, New Jersey â€“ August 15, 2013) was an American jazz singer, known for recording several tracks with famous musicians such as Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman during the 1940s. Harvey began her musical career at Barney Josephson's nightclub, occasionally performing there. In 1946, she joined Desi Arnaz's Orchestra, until she left in 1958 to raise her son, Bob Thiele Jr. She also entertained at military bases overseas with Bob Hope. During the late 1950s, she joined Duke Ellington's Orchestra. Around the time of her death, she performed locally, all over the Los Angeles area. Harvey died of cancer, at the age of 88, in her home." ;

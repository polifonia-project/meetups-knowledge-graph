        mtp:hasAbstract        "Scott Levy (born September 8, 1964) is an American professional wrestler better known by his ring name, Raven. He is known for his appearances with professional wrestling promotions including Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Widely recognized as \"one of the best talkers in wrestling\", Raven is known for his \"psychological heel tactics\" and grunge-inspired gimmick. His feud with The Sandman in the mid-1990s has been described as \"one of the most emotional rivalries in professional wrestling's history\". He is one of the most decorated wrestlers in history, with 37 title reigns between WWE, WCW, ECW, and TNA, including being a three-time World Champion and having a record 27 reigns as WWF/E Hardcore Champion. After having an eight plus year career in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) now known as Impact Wrestling, Raven was inducted into the Impact Hall of Fame in 2022." ;

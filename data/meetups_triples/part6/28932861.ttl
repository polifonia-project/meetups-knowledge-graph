        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Joseph \"Mike\" Kelly Jr. (born May 10, 1948) is an American politician and businessman who has been a U.S. representative since 2011 and is currently serving as representative for Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district. The district, numbered as the 3rd district from 2011 to 2019, is based in Erie and stretches from the northwest corner of the state to the outer northern suburbs of Pittsburgh. A member of the Republican Party, he is known for his support of Donald Trump, characterizing the 2019 effort to impeach Trump as being akin to Pearl Harbor and filing a lawsuit in state court to invalidate all mail-in ballots cast in Pennsylvania during the 2020 United States presidential election. On October 22, 2021, it was reported that a congressional ethics watchdog has recommended subpoenaing Kelly for an ethics violation after it was revealed that his wife had purchased stock in an Ohio-based steel company in April 2020 after Kelly had received confidential information about the company. In June, 2022, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson revealed that Kelly was responsible for providing a slate of fake electors that was meant to overturn Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 election. Kelly's office has denied his role in this event." ;

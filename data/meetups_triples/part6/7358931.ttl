He has also provided live sound mixing with bands including The Wonder Stuff, Jesus Jones, Diamond Head, Orson, Obituary and Napalm Death. Efemy was instrumental in setting up the recording studio and rehearsal rooms in Stourbridge known as Wreckless and later on The Icicle Works, providing a local source of affordable practice space and recording facilities for local amateur bands. During this time Efemey also participated in musical performances, fronting acts such as Stinkinâ€™ Fish. Efemey was the cover star of the withdrawn sleeve design for The Wildhearts' 1993 single \"Greetings from Shitsville\", on which he was depicted defecating into a pita bread held by the four band members." ;

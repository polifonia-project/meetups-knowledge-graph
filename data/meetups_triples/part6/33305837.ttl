        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edward Benton Reeves (November 17, 1939 – November 18, 2018) was an American songwriter, recording artist, music publisher, artist manager, record company executive, and author. He wrote several hit songs including \"All I Ever Need Is You\" co-written with Jimmy Holiday and recorded by many artists including Ray Charles, Sonny & Cher, Ray Sanders, Andre Hazes, Tom Jones, Sammi Smith, Chet Atkins & Jerry Reed and Kenny Rogers & Dottie West; \"Rings\", co-written with Alex Harvey and recorded by Cymarron, Lobo, Reuben Howell, Leo Kottke, Twiggy, Tompall and The Glaser Brothers, Lonnie Mack (a vocal rendition from the guitar man of \"Memphis\" hit record fame), and other artists; \"Don't Change on Me\" co-written with Jimmy Holiday and recorded by Ray Charles, B.B. King, Van Morrison (recorded for Warner Bros. but available only on an Italian bootleg album), and by Alan Jackson; \"If You Wouldn't Be My Lady\", co-written with Jimmy Holiday and recorded by both Ray Charles and Charlie Rich; and \"It’s a Hang Up Baby\", recorded by both Jerry Lee Lewis and Z.Z. Hill. The song was also performed on November 6, 1969, by Tom Jones with musical backing by the Moody Blues on his national television show, This Is Tom Jones. BMI awarded Reeves and co-writer Harvey their Special Citation of Achievement for \"Rings\", having received over one million radio and television performances, making it one of the most performed songs from BMI's repertoire of over eight million songs. Reeves' songs are associated with three Grammy Award nominations: 1972 Pop Vocal Group – Sonny & Cher – \"All I Ever Need Is You\" lyrics; 1972 Best Country Vocal Performance – Duo or Group – Tompall & the Glaser Bros. – \"Rings\"; and 1973 Best Country Instrumental Performance – Chet Atkins, Jerry Reed – Me and Chet (album, which included \"All I Ever Need Is You\")." ;

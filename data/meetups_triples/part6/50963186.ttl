        mtp:hasAbstract        "Au Nok-hin (Chinese: 區諾軒; born 18 June 1987) is a pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong. He is the former member of the Legislative Council for Hong Kong Island from 2018 to 2019 and member of the Southern District Council for Lei Tung I from 2012 to 2019. From 2016 to 2017, Au was the convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front. In the 2018 Legislative Council by-election triggered by oath-taking controversy, Au replaced Demosistō candidate Agnes Chow who was disqualified over her alleged pro-independence stance. He was elected with more than 130,000 votes. Au was a member of the Democratic Party until 2017. In December 2019, Chow's disqualification was ruled unlawful by a court, invalidating the by-election result and unseating Au." ;

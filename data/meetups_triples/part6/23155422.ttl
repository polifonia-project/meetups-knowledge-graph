        mtp:hasAbstract        "David \"Dai\" Greene (born 11 April 1986) is a British hurdler who specialises in the 400 metres hurdles, competing internationally for both Wales and Great Britain. In a 'golden' sixteen-month period between 2010 and 2011, Greene dominated the event at international level, winning the World, European, Diamond League and Commonwealth titles in quick succession, in addition to winning the event as part of both the European Team Championships and the IAAF Continental Cup. Hindered by a knee injury, Greene finished in 4th at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and the same injury prevented him from being competitive at global level thereafter. He is the second fastest British man over the 400 m hurdles, behind the British record holder, Kriss Akabusi." ;

He was born in Palermo, Sicily, and began his career in the 1950s, although his career only really took off in the 1960s. He starred in many comedies, mainly appearing together with Franco Franchi as the comedy duo Franco and Ciccio. During the 1980s he also did television work. In the 1966 film Due Marines e un Generale (released internationally as War Italian Style), Franco and Ciccio worked with Buster Keaton." ;

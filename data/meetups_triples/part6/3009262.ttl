        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Charles Dashut (born September 19, 1951) is an American record producer who produced several Fleetwood Mac albums including Rumours, Tusk, Live, Mirage, Tango in the Night, and Time. Dashut was born in West Hollywood, California, and started his career sweeping floors in a recording studio where he later met Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Keith Olsen hired Dashut as a maintenance worker at Sound City and later employed him as second engineer on a few albums including Buckingham Nicks, which in turn led to Dashut's work with Fleetwood Mac. Dashut also co-wrote several songs with Lindsey Buckingham and also co-produced two of his albums, which are Law and Order and Out of the Cradle." ;

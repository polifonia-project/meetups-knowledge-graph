Montague stressed the difference between his philosophical peers as adherents of either \"objective\" and \"critical realism\". Montague was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts. He was professor of philosophy at UC Berkeley between 1899 and 1903, and at Columbia University from 1903 to 1947. He was president of the American Philosophical Association's eastern division in the years 1923–1924. He died in New York City." ;

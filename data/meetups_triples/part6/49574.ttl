        mtp:hasAbstract        "Abbot Howard \"Abbie\" Hoffman (November 30, 1936 – April 12, 1989) was an American political and social activist who co-founded the Youth International Party (\"Yippies\") and was a member of the Chicago Seven. He was also a leading proponent of the Flower Power movement. As a member of the Chicago Seven, Hoffman was charged with and tried―for activities during the 1968 Democratic National Convention―for conspiring to use interstate commerce with intent to incite a riot and crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot under the anti-riot provisions of Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Five of the Chicago Seven defendants, including Hoffman, were convicted of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot; all of the convictions were vacated after an appeal and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to pursue another trial. Hoffman, along with all of the defendants and their attorneys were also convicted and sentenced for contempt of court by the judge; these convictions were also vacated after an appeal. Hoffman continued his activism into the 1970s, and remains an icon of the anti-Vietnam war movement and the counterculture era. He died of an intentional phenobarbital overdose in 1989 at age 52." ;

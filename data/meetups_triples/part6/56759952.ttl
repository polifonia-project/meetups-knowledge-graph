        mtp:hasAbstract        "Penuell Mpapa Maduna (born 29 December 1952) is a South African politician and businessman. An anti-apartheid activist in his youth, Maduna was appointed to President Nelson Mandela's government in 1994. Thereafter he served as Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs and, between 1999 and 2004, as Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development. Holding a doctorate of law from Unisa, he was also a long-time legal adviser to his party, the African National Congress, which he represented during the negotiations to end apartheid. His term as Justice Minister, under President Thabo Mbeki, was blighted by controversy arising from prosecutorial investigations into Deputy President Jacob Zuma on corruption charges. Maduna resigned from politics in 2004 and is now a businessman." ;

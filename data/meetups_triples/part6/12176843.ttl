He describes himself as \"classically trained\" but also points to a minimalist influence. His art revolves around a personal mythology drawn from creation myths, particle physics, thermodynamics, and games of chance, among other elements. Ritchie is married to Garland Hunter, an artist and actress who appeared in The Tao of Steve." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Viviane Romance (born Pauline Ronacher Ortmanns; July 4, 1912 – September 25, 1991) was a French actress. Viviane Romance was born in Roubaix, France. She began her career as a dancer at the Moulin Rouge in Paris and was elected Miss Paris of 1930 before she made her film debut in 1931 with a cameo role in La Chienne. Romance caused a small scandal winning Miss Paris because she had a child. She appeared in several films over the next few years before making a strong impression in La belle équipe (1936). From this time to the late 1950s she was regarded as one of France's leading cinematic actresses and played dozens of femme fatales, fallen women (with hearts of gold) and vamps. Her acting roles after 1956 were few, and she retired in 1974. Romance was offered, and rejected, a Hollywood film contract in the 1930s. She preferred to make films in her native France. However, she also resided for many years in Italy where she made several Italian language films. She was married three times, including to the actor Georges Flamant and the film director Jean Josipovici who directed her in three films. She died in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France." ;

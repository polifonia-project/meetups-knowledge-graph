        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gautier le Leu (born 1210?), sometimes referred to as Gautier le Long, was a French minstrel who wrote in the middle of the 13th century. He is one of the most important authors of fabliaux, six of which are attributed to him (mostly on erotic and scatological topics) and also wrote two dits, a poem of proverbs, and a longer narrative poem. He is thought to have originated from the County of Hainaut, in what is today Belgium. He may have received clerical training in Orl√©ans or Cologne." ;

He planned later attempts at assassinating other British royal family members but was kept away from them by the authorities in New Zealand. In 1997, he was charged with the murder of Tania Furlan and the kidnapping of her daughter, though a friend was found to be responsible. He died by suicide before he could be brought to trial." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "General Prince Yasuhiko Asaka (朝香宮鳩彦王, Asaka-no-miya Yasuhiko-ō, 20 October 1887 – 12 April 1981) was the founder of a collateral branch of the Japanese imperial family and a general in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Japanese invasion of China and the Second World War. Son-in-law of Emperor Meiji and uncle by marriage of Emperor Hirohito, Prince Asaka was commander of Japanese forces in the final assault on Nanjing, then the capital city of Nationalist China, in December 1937. Japanese forces under his command committed the Nanjing massacre. After the war, General Douglas MacArthur granted immunity to members of the Imperial family, as a result Asaka was never tried for his involvement in the Nanking Massacre by SCAP authorities. Asaka and his children lost their imperial status in 1947, afterwards he converted to Catholicism and died of natural causes at the age of 93." ;

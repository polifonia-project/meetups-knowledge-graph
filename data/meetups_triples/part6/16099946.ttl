        mtp:hasAbstract        "Walter Hugo Khouri (São Paulo, 21 October 1929 – São Paulo, 27 June 2003) was a Brazilian film director, screenwriter, and producer of Lebanese and Italian descent. Khouri made 25 feature films and won several national and international awards. His 1964 film Empty Night is considered one of the best Brazilian films of all time and was entered for the Palm d'Or in the 1965 Cannes Film Festival. His films show characters, mostly male, who seek meaning for a distressing existence. He was also known for welcoming and introducing young professionals, being the first director to cast the presenter Xuxa Meneghel in the controversial 1982 film Love Strange Love." ;

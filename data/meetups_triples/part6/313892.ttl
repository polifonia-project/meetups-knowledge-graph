He is popularly known as the author of two sayings: (1) \"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And being for myself, what am \"I\"? And if not now, when?\" and (2) the expression of the ethic of reciprocity, or \"Golden Rule\": \"That which is hateful to you, do not do unto your fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; now go and learn.\"" ;

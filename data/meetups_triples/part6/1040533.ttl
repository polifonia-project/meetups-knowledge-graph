        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martin Faranan McDonagh (/məkˈdɒnə/; born 26 March 1970) is a British-Irish playwright, screenwriter, producer, and director. Born and brought up in London, he is the son of Irish parents. He is known as one of the most acclaimed modern playwrights whose work has spanned over two decades. He is celebrated for his absurdist black humor which often challenges the modern theatre aesthetic. He has received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, four BAFTA Award, three Laurence Olivier Awards, and nominations for five Tony Awards. He started his career in the Royal National Theatre with The Pillowman in 2003. He has since written many plays produced on the West End and on Broadway including The Beauty Queen of Leenane (1996), The Cripple of Inishmaan (1996), The Lieutenant of Inishmore (2001), A Behanding in Spokane (2010), and Hangmen (2015). He has received five Laurence Olivier Award nominations with three wins, and four Tony Award nominations. McDonagh won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for Six Shooter in 2004 and has received nominations for three other Academy Awards. He directed the dark comedy films In Bruges (2008), Seven Psychopaths (2012), Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), and The Banshees of Inisherin (2022). He's received four British Academy Film Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards." ;

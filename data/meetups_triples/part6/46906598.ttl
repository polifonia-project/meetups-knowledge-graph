Born and raised in Auckland, he became the drummer of alternative rock band Blindspott in 1997, before leaving the group in 2008. Later that year, Woolright formed the group I Am Giant in the United Kingdom, before the group returned to New Zealand to produce their music career. Woolright launched his solo project Deadbeat in November 2017. In March 2015, it was announced that Woolright would become a judge on the second series of The X Factor, replacing the sacked Willy Moon. He mentored Brendon Thomas and The Vibes to the final, where they finished in third place. The X Factor was later cancelled following the airing of the second series." ;

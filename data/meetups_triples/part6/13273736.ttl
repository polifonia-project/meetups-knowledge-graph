        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tan Paey Fern (simplified Chinese: 陈佩芬; traditional Chinese: 陳佩芬; pinyin: Chén Pèifēn) is a Singaporean table tennis Player. Tan was talent-scouted by ex-National Table Tennis Coach, Mr. Foo Soo Peng, when she was playing table tennis casually with her brother and some friends at the age of 9. Tan was a very determined young girl. She gave up her studies to practice table tennis. Her parents were worried but were very supportive. Tan's skills vastly improved, and she soon turned semi-professional, becoming a full-time professional player in 1993." ;

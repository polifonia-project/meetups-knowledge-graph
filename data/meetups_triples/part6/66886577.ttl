        mtp:hasAbstract        "Professor Reinhard Strohm FBA (born 4 August 1942, Munich) is a German musicologist based largely in the United Kingdom, with an interest in 14th to 18th-century music. Strohm studied Musicology, Medieval Latin, and Romance Literatures, at the University of Munich, Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, and the Technical University of Berlin during 1961–1969. He earned his Ph.D. degree at TU Berlin in 1971, with Carl Dahlhaus, producing a dissertation titled “Italienische Opernarien des frühen Settecento (1720–1730). Strohm taught at King's College London during 1975–1983 and 1990–1996 as a lecturer, then a reader, and finally a professor. Between these two periods, he was Professor of Musicology at Yale University in the United States. He was the Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University during 1996–2007. Between 1970–1982, Strohm was a co-editor for an edition of works by Richard Wagner (Richard-Wagner-Gesamtausgabe). Strohm won the 2012 Balzan Prize for Musicology. Strohm is a Fellow of the British Academy (since 1993) and an Emeritus Professor of Music at Wadham College, Oxford." ;

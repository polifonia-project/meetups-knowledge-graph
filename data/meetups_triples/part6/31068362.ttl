They are best known for winning the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race and remain the only Asian American to win the show.

Outside of drag, Amrullah is also known for their makeup artistry on the reality television show America's Next Top Model (cycles four through twelve). Amrullah's clients include Tyra Banks, Dita von Teese, Pamela Anderson, Paulina Porizkova, Iman, Iggy Azalea, RuPaul, and Twiggy.

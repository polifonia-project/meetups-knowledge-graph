Blizard was born in New South Wales and plays golf at New South Wales Golf Club. Blizard was a member of the Golf Australia National Squad before turning pro at the end of 2008. The highlight of his amateur career came in March 2007 when he claimed the Australian Amateur at his home course. He used local knowledge to his advantage, progressing to the final where he defeated fellow New South Welshman Justin Roach 3 & 2. His career highlight came in 2011 when he claimed the John Hughes Geely Nexus Risk Services Western Australia Open Championship, shooting a 5-under-par 67 in the final round for a 10-under-par total.

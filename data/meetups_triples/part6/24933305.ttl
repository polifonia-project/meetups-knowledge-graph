        mtp:hasAbstract        "John and Edward Grimes (born 16 October 1991), collectively known as Jedward (a portmanteau of their first names), are an Irish singing and television presenting duo. They are identical twins who first appeared as John & Edward in the sixth series of The X Factor in 2009, generating a phenomenon of ironic popularity described as \"the Jedward paradox\". They finished in sixth place and were managed by Louis Walsh, who was their mentor during The X Factor. Jedward have released four studio albums: Planet Jedward (2010), Victory (2011), Young Love (2012), and Voice of a Rebel (2019). Their first two albums went double platinum in Ireland. They have released several singles, including \"Under Pressure (Ice Ice Baby)\", \"Bad Behaviour\", \"Lipstick\", with which they represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 in Düsseldorf, and \"Waterline\", with which they represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku. Jedward are also known for their television work, including starring in the documentary series Jedward: Let Loose (2010), presenting the children's series OMG! Jedward's Dream Factory (2011 –2013) and Jedward's Big Adventure (2012–2014), and participating in the reality series Celebrity Big Brother 8 (2011), Celebrity Big Brother 19 (2017), in which they finished as runners-up, and Celebrity Coach Trip 4 (2019). Jedwards's combined net worth was estimated at €6m in September 2013, and they have been ranked as the fifth most financially successful former X Factor UK contestants." ;

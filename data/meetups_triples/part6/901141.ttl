        mtp:hasAbstract        "Deion Luwynn Sanders Sr. (born August 9, 1967), is an American football coach and former player who is the incoming head football coach at the University of Colorado Boulder. Nicknamed \"Prime Time\", he played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, and Baltimore Ravens. Sanders was also a baseball outfielder for nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, and San Francisco Giants. He won two Super Bowl titles and made one World Series appearance in 1992, making him the only athlete to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series. Sanders played college football at Florida State, where he won the Jim Thorpe Award as a senior. He was selected by the Falcons fifth overall in the 1989 NFL Draft and played football primarily at cornerback, while also making appearances at kick returner, punt returner, and wide receiver. During his career, he was named to eight Pro Bowls, received six first-team All-Pros, and made consecutive Super Bowl appearances in Super Bowl XXIX with the 49ers and Super Bowl XXX with the Cowboys, winning both. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011. After retiring as a player, Sanders pursued a sports analyst and coaching career. He is serving as the head football coach at Jackson State University from 2020 to the end of the 2022 season, and has lead the team to two consecutive Celebration Bowl appearances and the first undefeated season in school history. Near the end of the 2022 season, Sanders was named the head football coach at Colorado." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carol Ann Doda (August 29, 1937 â€“ November 9, 2015) was an American topless dancer based in San Francisco, California, who was active from the 1960s through the 1980s. She was the first public topless dancer in the United States. In 1964, Doda made international news, first by dancing topless at the city's Condor Club, then by enhancing her bust from size 34 to 44 through silicone injections. A year later, she was arrested along with the owners of the Condor Club, but all three of them were later cleared of charges. Her breasts became known as Doda's \"twin 44s\" and \"the new Twin Peaks of San Francisco\"." ;

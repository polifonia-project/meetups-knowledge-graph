        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jared Scott Fogle (/ˈfoʊɡəl/; born August 23, 1977) is an American former spokesman for Subway restaurants. Fogle appeared in Subway's advertising campaigns from 2000 to 2015, when he publicly became the subject of a Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation. The FBI probe led to him being convicted of child sex tourism and possessing child pornography. While a student at Indiana University, Fogle lost 245 lb (111 kg) between 1998 and 1999. Having frequented a Subway restaurant as part of his diet plan, he was hired to help advertise the company the following year. Fogle's popularity led to him being featured in over 300 commercials during his 15 years with Subway, alongside other media appearances. Allegations of Fogle having inappropriate relations with minors began in 2007, but did not gain traction until 2015 when the FBI uncovered that he received child pornography from an associate. Pleading guilty to the child sex tourism and child pornography charges the same year, Fogle was sentenced to 15 years, 8 months in federal prison. He is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood." ;

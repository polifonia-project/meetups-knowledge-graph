        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Crist (born March 20, 1984) is an American comedian from Lilburn, Georgia. His highest-viewed YouTube sketches include \"Every parent at Disney\", \"Millennial International: Sponsor a Millennial Today\", and \"If golf and soccer switched announcers\". He is also known for his work creating comedy sketch videos for BuzzFeed. Crist has opened for Jeff Foxworthy, Dave Chappelle, Seth Meyers, Tim Hawkins, and Anjelah Johnson. Crist's comedy often focuses on Christian subculture. He occasionally uses his comedy to critique problems he sees in the Christian church. In November 2019, allegations of sexual misconduct led to Crist cancelling his \"Immature Thoughts\" comedy tour, and a planned Netflix stand-up special featuring him was put \"on hold.\" In July 2020, he returned with a video message on social media in which he accepted responsibility for his actions and thanked his followers for their support in his recovery." ;

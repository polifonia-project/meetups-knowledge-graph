        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Albert Kitzhaber (born March 5, 1947) is an American former politician who served as the 35th governor of Oregon from 1995 to 2003, and as the 37th governor of Oregon from 2011 until his resignation in 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, Kitzhaber was the longest-serving governor in the state's history. Kitzhaber resigned from office on February 18, 2015, a month after he was sworn in for his fourth term. State and federal authorities were investigating criminal allegations against him and his fianc√©e, Cylvia Hayes. Secretary of State Kate Brown succeeded him. In 2017, the federal government dropped its investigation against Kitzhaber without filing charges. The Oregon ethics commission found 10 instances when Kitzhaber used his political office for personal gain. He agreed to pay a settlement fine of $20,000. A physician in Roseburg, Kitzhaber was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1978. After one term, he won an Oregon Senate seat in 1980, serving three terms, until 1993. He was Senate President from 1985 to 1993." ;

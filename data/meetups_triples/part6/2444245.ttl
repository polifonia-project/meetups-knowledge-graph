        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kim Hyun-jung (Korean: 김현정, born April 4, 1976) is a South Korean pop singer.Well known as the \"Long-legged singer\", and with the experience of performing in a heavy metal band, Kim made her debut as a female solo singer with the dance-infused \"Legend\". The song \"Breakup with Her\" was a fast-tempo song with strong beats that shot Kim quickly to the top. The song \"Lonely Love\" was also a great hit. Since her debut, Kim Hyun-jung has succeeded in releasing great songs, usually dance numbers. In 1997, Kim catapulted to stardom almost instantly after her debut, with her distinctively high voice and slim figure - the ordinary image of a female Korean singer by today’s standards, but a rarity at the time." ;

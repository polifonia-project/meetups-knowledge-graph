Earlier in 1965 he won the national title and a European silver medal in coxed fours. After retiring from competitions Hertel became a prominent physician specializing in knee injuries. Since 1991 he heads the trauma section of the Berlin Martin Luther hospital and personally performs about 800 surgeries per year. The hospital is annually visited by ca. 10,000 patients. Hertel is married to Jutta Stöck, an Olympic sprinter and daughter of Olympic javelin champion Gerhard Stöck. They have one daughter and two sons; one of the sons, Ole Hertel, competed nationally in shot put and discus throw." ;

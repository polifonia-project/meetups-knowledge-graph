        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eduard Hempel (6 June 1887, Pirna â€“ 12 November 1972, Gundelfingen) was a German diplomat. He was the German Minister to Ireland between 1937 and 1945, in the buildup to and during The Emergency (Second World War). When he was first appointed to the post he was not a Nazi party member, but a short while after his appointment, the Berlin regime put him under extreme pressure to join. Prior to his appointment, the Irish External Affairs ministry had specified that they did not want a Nazi party member as diplomatic representative; the solution to this requirement appears to have been to appoint a person who was not a member of the party, but Hempel took steps to join the following year, his NSDAP card being dated 1 July 1938." ;

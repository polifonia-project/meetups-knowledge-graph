After underperforming, McKee was dropped by her label and took a musical hiatus before establishing herself as a songwriter. McKee has written 10 singles that have reached number one in either the United States or the United Kingdom, which have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide combined. In 2013, McKee made a return to music with a slew of singles, including \"American Girl\". She would later independently release an EP, Bombastic (2015). McKee is particularly known for collaborating with pop singer Katy Perry, and the duo has written the hits \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", \"Part of Me\", \"Wide Awake\", and \"Roar\" together.

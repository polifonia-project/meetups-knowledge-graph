        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roberts Gobziņš (born 13 July 1964 in Riga, Latvian SSR), also known as Eastbam or East Bam (as a result of his artistic connections with Westbam) is a Latvian entertainer. His career has encompassed work as a musician, DJ, MC, radio personality (often with comedic overtones) and parliamentary candidate. He is best known as a member or collaborator with numerous bands (Dzeltenie Pastnieki, NSRD, Diskomforts, 19 gadi pirms sākuma, Kaija, CSK, Fortress, Dzidriņas Megasistēma, Smalkie Regeji, Los Amigos, Resnie Putni, Twinkle Brothers) and, throughout the 1990s, as a nationally successful solo artist. He pioneered Latvian language rap music in 1982 by including a rap interlude on Dzeltenie Pastnieki song \"Bezcerīgā dziesma\" on the album Man ļoti patīk jaunais vilnis and later releasing the first-ever Latvian rap 12-inch single (\"Aka Aka\") on Westbam's Low Spirit label. Performing live in Germany, he has shared the bill with De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers. In 1997, the avant-garde opera Rolstein on the Beach featured Gobziņš in the role of \"The Son of Rothschild\". In 2003, Gobziņš took part in \"Aka Hip Aka Hop\", a collaboration with A.G., Raitis, Giuseppe and Gustavo, celebrating the history of the local scene. He again was the opening act for De La Soul on December 11, 2004 in Riga." ;

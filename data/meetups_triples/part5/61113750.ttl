        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julian Rochfort Belfrage (19 February 1934 – 28 December 1994) was an actor's agent whose clients included Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Hurt, Daniel Day-Lewis, David Warner, Sir Ian Holm and Colin Blakely. For ten years he was in partnership with Michael Whitehall under the brand Leading Artists. Belfrage's obituary in The Independent stated that he ‘often fired clients he did not like and yet the lowest he would sink in condemnation was that such and such didn't know how to live’. Belfrage, however, was a true bon viveur. He had a particular love of the turf which he playfully enjoyed with John Hurt and Christopher Reeve. Despite his success, he was described as caring not one jot for money, unless it afforded a day at the races." ;

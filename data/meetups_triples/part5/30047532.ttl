The Music Society performed her works as early as 1922, and after this initial success, Gow began studying at the Royal College of Music when she was in her thirties. Gow was living at 184 Earls Court Road at the time of the 1901 census. She studied composition with Vaughan Williams at the Royal College of Music and with Egon Wellesz in Vienna. She never married and died in London." ;

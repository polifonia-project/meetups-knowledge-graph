        mtp:hasAbstract        "Greg Roberts (born 29 May 1956) is an English drummer. He was a member of Big Audio Dynamite from 1984 to 1990, a band led by Mick Jones, former lead guitarist, and co-lead vocalist of the Clash. He went on to form Screaming Target in 1991 with ex-Big Audio Dynamite members Don Letts and Leo \"E-Zee Kill\" Williams, then started Dreadzone with Tim Bran, Williams and Dan Donovan, another former Big Audio Dynamite member. Dreadzone had a No. 20 hit in the UK Singles Chart with \"Little Britain\" in 1996. A self-taught musician, Roberts has said that his experience with Big Audio Dynamite – particularly the band's use of technology (including a drum machine) – enabled him to become a writer and arranger, and also led to him forming Dreadzone. Roberts has also worked as a session musician, playing on Scott Merritt's fourth studio album, Violet and Black (1990)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kay Toinette Oslin (May 15, 1942 â€“ December 21, 2020) was an American country music singer-songwriter. She had several years of major commercial success in the late 1980s after signing a record deal at age 45. Oslin had four number one hits and placed additional singles on the Billboard country chart during that timespan; in addition, she won three Grammy Awards and is an inductee of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Oslin moved to Alabama after the death of her father, then to Texas. She developed an appreciation for folk music while studying theater in college and later started a folk trio. In 1966, she returned to theater after being cast in the touring production of Hello, Dolly! She then moved to New York City, where she continued acting in Broadway musicals and television commercials. At the same time, she began songwriting as a hobby. After a demo recording was made of her music, Oslin briefly signed to Elektra Records in 1981 without much success. She later signed to RCA Records in 1986 and had her first major hit the following year with \"80's Ladies.\" Her 1987 debut album of the same name would sell over one million copies and produce three additional hits, including the number one single \"Do Ya.\" Oslin released This Woman (1988) and Love in a Small Town (1990), which reached the top ten of the Billboard charts. The albums spawned hit singles including \"Hold Me,\" \"Hey Bobby\" and \"Come Next Monday.\" In the early 1990s, she left her recording contract and went into a hiatus following several personal setbacks. In 1996, she returned with the studio album \"My Roots Are Showing...\" and then in 2001 with Live Close By, Visit Often. Oslin released her final album in 2015 titled Simply." ;

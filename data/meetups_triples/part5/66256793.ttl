        mtp:hasAbstract        "Suzanne Mallouk (born September 10, 1960) is a Canadian-born painter, psychiatrist, and psychoanalyst based in New York City. She is best known for being amongst a core of East Village creatives in the 1980s and for her relationship with artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, both of which are chronicled by her friend Jennifer Clement in Widow Basquiat: A Memoir. In 2015, Vogue magazine listed Basquiat and Mallouk among \"The 21 Most Stylish Art World Couples of All Time.\" Mallouk was involved in the pursuit of justice for the death of Michael Stewart, a victim of police brutality in 1983. In 1985, Mallouk had a one-woman show at the Vox Populi Gallery in the East Village. She also had a brief music career as singer and songwriter performing under the stage name Ruby Desire. From 1990 to 2005, she pursued her education and became a Doctor of Medicine with a specialty in psychiatry." ;

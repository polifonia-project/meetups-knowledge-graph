        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maurice Clark McAdow (17 November 1904 in Greenville, Illinois â€“ 20 August 2001 in Denton, Texas) was an American conductor, trumpeter, and music educator (with high proficiency on woodwinds) who served as director of bands at the University of North Texas College of Music for 29 years, from fall 1945 to spring 1975. The concert bands under his direction were acclaimed for performing a wide repertoire that exhibited advanced levels of musicianship commensurate with a major music school. The marching bands under his direction were known for innovative and colorful halftime shows. Since the mid-1940s, the College of Music had been, and still is, among the nation's largest music schools. Due to the size of the music school, his marching bands were filled with an unusual number of music majors, sometimes exceeding 90%." ;

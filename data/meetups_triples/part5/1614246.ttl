        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Dee Loudermilk Jr. (March 31, 1934 â€“ September 21, 2016) was an American singer and songwriter. Although he had his own recording career during the 1950s and 1960s, he was primarily known as a songwriter. His best-known songs include \"Indian Reservation\", a 1968 hit for UK singer Don Fardon and a U.S. No. 1 hit in 1971 for Paul Revere & the Raiders. He wrote \"Ebony Eyes\", a 1961 U.K. No. 1 and U.S. No. 8 for the Everly Brothers, and also wrote \"Tobacco Road\", a 1964 Top 20 hit in both the U.S. and the U.K. for the Nashville Teens, \"This Little Bird\", a U.K. No. 6 for Marianne Faithfull in 1965, and \"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\", a U.S. Top Ten hit in 1967 for the Casinos. That song was also a U.S. No. 1 country hit for Eddy Arnold in the following year." ;

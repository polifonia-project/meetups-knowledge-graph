        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elliot Brett Levine (born September 28, 1963) is an American pianist and keyboardist. He had two record releases on the Nashville-based Artifex records label between 1999 and 2004. His CD projects have been reviewed in the Wall Street Journal Online and the Washington Post. In March 2012 he was the first person to use an iPad Keytar, an iPad with a guitar strap, in a live performance posted to YouTube. Levine has toured with Wilson Pickett and Heatwave (Always & Forever/Boogie Nights). He has opened for Brian McKnight, Freddie Jackson, McCoy Tyner, and Gerald Albright. He has had the #1 song on mp3.com, receiving over 1,000,000 downloads, which was mentioned in the Wall Street Journal and CNN. Levine has four internationally released CDs. He has headlined at Blues Alley and the Kennedy Center. His playing has been described by Jazz Times as \"showing plenty of talent, though also criticized as having \"feather-weight play against heavy-leaden R&B backdrops\". In 2003, he scored the music to an Emmy nominated documentary, \"Teens in Between\". His music was also used on \"Inside the NBA\" on TBS (TV Channel) (2001), as well as an independent college movie, \"Friends With Benefits\" (2003). He is also featured on the worldwide Karvavena release \"The Abduction of the Art of Noise\". He currently tours in the United States as a member of Heatwave. It was reported that he is part owner of Authentic (racehorse), the horse that won the Kentucky Derby" ;

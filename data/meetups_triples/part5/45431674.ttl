Most of the instrumentation and controllers Shone uses, called \"Drone Machines\" and \"Dub Machines\", are custom-designed and fabricated by Shone from raw materials and open-source electronic circuitry. Shone has released nine albums as Author & Punisher, with Melk en Honing (2015) and Pressure Mine (2017) released through Phil Anselmo's record label Housecore Records. His latest, Kr√ºller, was released by Relapse Records on February 11, 2022." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eve Libertine (born Bronwyn Lloyd Jones; 1949) is an English singer. She was one of the vocalists who worked with English anarcho-punk band Crass. Her works with the band include the single \"Reality Asylum\", as well as performing most of the vocals on the group's third album, Penis Envy (1981), the lyrics of which have a heavy anarcha-feminist content. After the dissolution of Crass in 1984, Libertine worked with her son Nemo Jones, a guitarist. She trained as a classical singer and has performed as part of Crass Agenda (renamed Last Amendment as of 2005) and with Penny Rimbaud, Matt Black, Christine Tobin, Julian Siegel, Ingrid Laubrock, Nabil Shaban, and Kate Shortt. Libertine held her first exhibition of artwork, entitled Head On, at the 96 Gillespie gallery, Finsbury Park, London, in September 2005. She has designed album sleeves for Christine Tobin and Partisans. Bracketpress released a limited edition set of cards with her artwork to raise funds for Butterfield Green Community Orchard in north London. In June 2010 Listen, Little Man! premiered in Brussel. Drawing on the writings and research of Wilhelm Reich, it is a semi-improvised performance for voice and signal generators with a back projected, scrolling graphic score. On 19 November 2011 she made a guest appearance at fellow Crass bandmate Steve Ignorant's \"The Last Supper\" where they were joined on stage by Penny Rimbaud." ;

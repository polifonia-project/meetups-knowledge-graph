        mtp:hasAbstract        "Teófilo Augusto de Barros Neto better known as Theo de Barros is a Brazilian composer. Since the 1960s he has released and participated on albums with other Brazilian artists. He is known for his collaborations with Geraldo Vandré, for example on Disparada (tied with A banda by Chico Buarque for 1st place in the 2nd Festival de Música popular brasileira (MPB) 1966, produced and broadcast by TV Record), and for the song Menino das laranjas, recorded by Elis Regina that same year. In 1966 the band Quarteto Novo was formed (with de Barros, Airto Moreira, Heraldo do Monte and later Hermeto Pascoal), and in 1967 released one album which launched the careers of its members and had wide influence. He has collaborated with Inezita Barroso on her album Afinal." ;

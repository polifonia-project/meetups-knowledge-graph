Fonseca recorded Sinfónico in concert with Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional de Colombia in 2013. Released a year later. In early 2015, Fonseca was awarded La Musa Premio Triunfador by the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in May received the first-ever Contemporary Icon Award at the SESAC Latina Music Awards.

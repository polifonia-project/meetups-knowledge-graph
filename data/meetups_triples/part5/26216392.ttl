        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ruth Brewer Eisenberg (1902â€“1996) was \"Ivory\" of \"Ebony and Ivory,\" the inter-racial piano duo. Eisenberg and Margaret Patrick, \"Ebony,\" each had a stroke in 1982, which partially disabled them. Prior to the stroke, each had studied and played classical piano. Eisenberg was disabled on the left, Patrick on the right. They were introduced at a post-stroke group in Englewood, New Jersey by the program's director, who knew of their shared love for music and thought perhaps together, they could play as one. A reporter dubbed them \"Ebony and Ivory\" after the song by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder, which was then a hit." ;

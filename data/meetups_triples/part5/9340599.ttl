        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lari Michele White Cannon (/ˈlɑːri/, LAH-ree; May 13, 1965 – January 23, 2018) was an American country music singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. She made her debut in 1988 after winning You Can Be a Star, a televised talent competition on The Nashville Network. After an unsuccessful stint on Capitol Records Nashville, she signed to RCA Records Nashville in 1993. White released four albums for RCA between then and 1997: Lead Me Not, Wishes, Don't Fence Me In, and the compilation The Best of Lari White. Wishes was certified gold and charted three top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts: \"That's My Baby\", \"Now I Know\", and \"That's How You Know (When You're in Love)\". In 1998, she was the first artist signed to the former Lyric Street Records; she released Stepping Stone before leaving the label in 2000, and recorded all subsequent projects independently. Her musical style is defined by her vocal delivery and a variety of musical influences including country, blues, and contemporary R&B. In addition to her own work, White has produced albums for Toby Keith and Billy Dean, and has written songs for Tammy Wynette, Travis Tritt, Danny Gokey, and Sarah Buxton. She also acted in the television pilot XXX's and OOO's, the 2000 movie Cast Away, and her own cabaret production My First Affair. White was also married to songwriter Chuck Cannon until her death from peritoneal cancer in 2018." ;

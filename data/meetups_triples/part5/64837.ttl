        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rosemary Clooney (May 23, 1928 â€“ June 29, 2002) was an American singer and actress. She came to prominence in the early 1950s with the song \"Come On-a My House\", which was followed by other pop numbers such as \"Botch-a-Me\", \"Mambo Italiano\", \"Tenderly\", \"Half as Much\", \"Hey There\", \"This Ole House\", and \"Sway\". She also had success as a jazz vocalist. Clooney's career languished in the 1960s, partly because of problems related to depression and drug addiction, but revived in 1977, when her White Christmas co-star Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She continued recording until her death in 2002." ;

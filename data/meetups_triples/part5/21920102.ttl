        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Thomas Leo Marazzi (born 24 January 1975) is a British musician. He is the oldest member of boy band A1. Marazzi was the first to join A1, a British/Norwegian boy band whose first single, \"Be the First to Believe\", was released in 1999. Together with Marazzi were Britons Mark Read, Ben Adams and Norwegian Christian Ingebrigtsen. They were formed by band manager Tim Byrne, who also formed Steps, and signed to Columbia Records by A&R manager Fran de Takats. A1 won a BRIT Award for \"British Breakthrough Act\" in 2001. Their third album, Make It Good, featured a sound closer to traditional rock music, but was to be their last studio project with Marazzi. In October 2002, Marazzi took a break from the band citing personal reasons. Marazzi never gave a proper explanation on why he left the band letting fans wonder why he really left the band. In 2005, he started a band called Snagsby. He left Snagsby in January 2009 to pursue a career as a club DJ in The George Hotel in Whitby." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jack Kapp (born Jacob Kaplitzky; June 15, 1901 â€“ March 25, 1949) was a record company executive with Brunswick Records who founded the American Decca Records in 1934 along with British Decca founder Edward Lewis and later American Decca head Milton Rackmil. He oversaw Bing Crosby's rise to success as a recording artist in the early 1930s, and, four decades later, Crosby still gave appreciation to Kapp for diversifying his song catalogue into various styles and genres, saying, \"I thought he was crazy, but I just did what he told me.\" Kapp could not read or sing music, but to his talent he stressed the credo, \"Where's the melody?\"" ;

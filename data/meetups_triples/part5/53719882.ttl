        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tobias Forge (Swedish pronunciation: [tʊˈbǐːas ˈfɔ̌rːɡɛ]; born 3 March 1981) is a Swedish singer, musician, and songwriter. He is the leader and primary songwriter of the masked rock band Ghost, performing live as their vocalist under the stage names Papa Emeritus and Cardinal Copia. Although the band was formed in 2006, Forge's identity as the Ghost frontman was only confirmed in 2017, following a lawsuit by former band members due to a royalty dispute. Prior to finding success, he was in several other bands, including Repugnant and Crashdïet, under the stage name Mary Goore. For his musical accomplishments, Forge was awarded the 2019 Platinagitarren award from STIM, who explained \"With one foot standing firmly on the metal floor, Forge is a composer pushing the boundaries of the genre.\" Jury member and journalist Jan Gradvall stated that Forge is among the \"most visionary and creative in Swedish music history.\" Due to \"Ghost's epic progression from underground doom favorites to an arena phenomenon\" in the 2010s, Loudwire named Forge the Metal Artist of the Decade." ;

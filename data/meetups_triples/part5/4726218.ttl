Her published works include rock criticism, a memoir, and two series of science fiction/fantasy and murder mystery novels. Her books are evenly divided between the series The Keltiad and The Rock&Roll Murders: The Rennie Stride Mysteries. As first a writer and then the editor-in-chief of Jazz & Pop magazine in the late 1960s, she was one of the first women rock critics. Kennealy-Morrison worked as an advertising copywriter, receiving two Clio nominations. She was a Dame of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani, a High Priestess in a Celtic Pagan tradition and a member of Mensa." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jordan Timothy Jenks (born September 19, 1993), known professionally as Pi'erre Bourne (pea-AIR BORN), is an American rapper, record producer, and audio engineer. He is best known for producing the singles \"Magnolia\" by Playboi Carti and \"Gummo\" by 6ix9ine, entering the Top 30 of the US Billboard Hot 100. After the release of Playboi Carti's breakout track \"Magnolia\" from his self-titled debut commercial mixtape Playboi Carti (2017), Bourne's producer tag, \"Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?\" (a line sampled from an episode of The Jamie Foxx Show), became a viral phenomenon and an internet meme leading the tag to become widely known and Bourne to break out as a producer. Since the success of “Magnolia”, he has worked extensively with artists such as Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, Young Thug, Juice Wrld, Young Nudy, and Trippie Redd." ;

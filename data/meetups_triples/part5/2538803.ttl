His singing has been described in The Economist as \"flat, strangely penetrating tone, somewhere between rap and blues\". His breakthrough album, Bamako, produced by Ali Farka Touré, was released in 1994. It was voted one of the best rock albums of the year by Libération and one of the best world music albums by Le Monde." ;

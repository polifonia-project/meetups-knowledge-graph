        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stanley William Turrentine (April 5, 1934 â€“ September 12, 2000) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. He began his career playing R&B for Earl Bostic and later soul jazz recording for the Blue Note label from 1960, touched on jazz fusion during a stint on CTI in the 1970s. He was described by critic Steve Huey as \"renowned for his distinctively thick, rippling tone [and] earthy grounding in the blues.\" In the 1960s Turrentine was married to organist Shirley Scott, with whom he frequently recorded, and he was the younger brother of trumpeter Tommy Turrentine." ;

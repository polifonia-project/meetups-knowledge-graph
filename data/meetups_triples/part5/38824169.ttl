        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maxine \"Max\" Adele Feldman (December 26, 1945 â€“ August 17, 2007) was an American folk singer-songwriter, comedian and pioneer of women's music. Feldman's song \"Angry Atthis,\" first performed in May 1969 and first recorded in 1972, is considered the first openly distributed out lesbian song of what would become the women's music movement. Feldman identified as a \"big loud Jewish butch lesbian.\" In later years Feldman embraced a gender-fluid identity, according to partner Helen Thornton. Thornton described her partner's identity as \"both/and\" rather than \"either/or.\" Feldman had been comfortable with either gender label and wore men's clothing on stage." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clyde Lee McCoy (December 29, 1903 â€“ June 11, 1990), was an American jazz trumpeter whose popularity spanned seven decades. He is best remembered for his theme song, \"Sugar Blues\", written by Clarence Williams and Lucy Fletcher, and also as a co-founder of Down Beat magazine in 1935. The song hit in 1931 and 1935, in Columbia and Decca versions, and returned to Billboard magazine's Country (Hillbilly) chart in 1941. It was also played with vocals, by Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, Fats Waller and Ella Fitzgerald. Johnny Mercer had a vocal hit in 1947. McCoy was a member of one of the families of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, and was based at various times in Los Angeles, New York City, and at Chicago's Drake Hotel, where he first performed \"Sugar Blues\" in 1930. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6426 Hollywood Boulevard." ;

As a songwriter he penned songs like \"Reminiscing\", \"Lady\", \"Take It Easy on Me\", \"The Other Guy\" and \"The Night Owls\", each played millions of times on radio. As a producer, Goble's credits include John Farnham's Uncovered album in 1980 and his own . Goble is a keen student of concepts such as spirituality; he changed his first name from Graham to Graeham as a consequence of his interest in numerology and feng shui. Goble was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the 2021 Australia Day Honours \"for service to the performing arts as a singer,songwriter and producer.\"" ;

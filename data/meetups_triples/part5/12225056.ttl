He was born in Carmel, California. In 1995, It was reported that Montana suffered a heart attack and died while playing \"The Girl I Almost Married\" during a Beat Farmers show at the Longhorn Saloon in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. The cause of death has been otherwise reported by the San Diego Reader (a publication local to the home of the Beat Farmers) as having been ruled as an aneurysm. The band disbanded shortly thereafter." ;

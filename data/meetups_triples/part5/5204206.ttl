        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dayang Nurfaizah binti Awang Dowty (born 20 July 1981) is a Malaysian singer. Her debut self-titled album was released in May 1999 and it was recorded in the pop and R&B genres. The album's lead single, Hakikat Cinta introduced her to the local music industry. During her fifth year in the Malaysian music industry, Nurfaizah set up her own recording company, DN & AD Entertainment Sdn Bhd. Under that label, on 31 October 2004 she released her fourth studio album, Dayang Sayang Kamu, which was received with rave reviews from the Malaysian public as well as neighboring countries. In 2006, she participated in One in a Million, a singing competition hosted by Malaysian local television station 8TV. She ended up as one of the four finalists in the competition but was voted out by the Malaysian public on 15 September 2006, as the competition was determined by a 50% text message voting system." ;

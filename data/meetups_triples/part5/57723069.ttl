He is known for his songs \"Nadarang\", \"Shantidope\", \"MAU\", and \"Amatz\". Shanti Dope started writing verses in 2013 following the footsteps of local rappers who use songwriting as a way to tell stories. Influenced by the idea of storytelling through rap, his first long verse got him into rapper Smugglaz' 2015 album Walking Distance." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Shindell (born August 3, 1960) is an American folk singer, songwriter, producer, and musician. Shindell grew up in Port Washington, New York, and now lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his wife, , a university professor, and their children. Shindell's career received a boost in 1997 when Joan Baez recorded three of his songs (\"Fishing\", \"Reunion Hill\", and \"Money for Floods\") for her album Gone from Danger and invited the aspiring singer-songwriter to join her 1997â€“98 tour. Shindell collaborated with Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky to form the group Cry Cry Cry. On their eponymous 1998 album, Cry Cry Cry covered an eclectic mix of songwriters. The trio toured in support of their album before resuming solo careers. In 2017-2018 the group reunited briefly. The resulting tour culminated in a live recording of their final show on April 15, 2018, at The Freight and Salvage in Berkeley, CA, all proceeds of which went to support Live Music Society. A recording of cover songs, South of Delia, was released on Shindell's website in March 2007. An album of original material, Not Far Now, appeared in 2009. 13 Songs You May Or May Not Have Heard Before, a compilation of reworked previous releases and some new material, followed in 2011. , his most recent recording, was released in September 2016. Shindell and Lucy Kaplansky reunited to collaborate on a new album of cover songs, Tomorrow You're Going, funded through Kickstarter, and released in March 2015 under the name Pine Hill Project. In October 2019, Shindell announced that he would cease touring in order to pursue other projects. Shindell's songs and songwriting style often involves storytelling from a first-person point of view: an INS officer and illegal immigrant in \"Fishing\", a World War II soldier in \"Sparrows Point\", a Confederate drummer boy in \"Arrowhead\", an Argentine grandmother in \"Abuelita\", and a power broker in \"Confession\". His other personae include a New York City cab driver in \"The Last Fare of the Day\", a man on death row in \"Ascent\", a war widow in \"Reunion Hill\", and Mary Magdalene." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter Bramall (born 10 November 1950 in Lincolnshire, England), better known by his stage name Bram Tchaikovsky, is a British vocalist and guitarist. He first came to prominence as a member of UK punk/pub rock band The Motors, whom he joined in 1977. After he left them, he led an eponymous power pop band, with Micky Broadbent (bass, keyboards) and Keith Boyce (drums). He scored a US Top 40 hit single on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1979, with \"Girl of My Dreams\" (released February in UK, June in USA). In the Netherlands, \"Sarah Smiles\" was a minor hit, reaching number 32 in April 1979. Nick Garvey, Keith Line and Denis Forbes were also involved in later band lineups. In 1979 he played guitar for the Skids hit 'Into The Valley' on the BBC. After disappointing sales, the band split up in 1981 and Tchaikovsky left the music industry. Tchaikovsky was also credited with co writing \"Solid Ball of Rock\", from the 1991 Saxon album of the same name." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Joseph Brady (born 19 May 1947) is an Irish singer-songwriter and musician from Strabane, Northern Ireland. His work straddles folk and pop. He was interested in a wide variety of music from an early age. Initially popular for playing Irish traditional music in a duo with Andy Irvine and later with Tommy Peoples and Matt Molloy, he later turned to a more rock-inspired electric style with poignant political lyrics. Some of his most popular songs are: \"Crazy Dreams\", \"Nothing but the Same Old Story\", \"The Island\", \"Night Hunting Time\", \"Steel Claw\" and \"Paradise Is Here\"." ;

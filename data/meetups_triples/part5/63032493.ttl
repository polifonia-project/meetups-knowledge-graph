        mtp:hasAbstract        "Larisa Roxana Giurgiu (Romanian pronunciation: [laˈrisa rokˈsana ˈd͡ʒjurd͡ʒju]; born 5 January 2000), known professionally as Roxen (pronounced [rokˈsen]), is a Romanian singer signed to Global Records. They rose to prominence upon being featured on Romanian producer Sickotoy's \"You Don't Love Me\" (2019), which reached number three in Romania and received radio airplay in several other countries. The singer's following singles, \"Ce-ți cântă dragostea\" and \"Spune-mi\", eventually peaked atop the national chart. Roxen was scheduled to represent Romania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 with the song \"Alcohol You\" before the event's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cancellation. They were instead internally selected as the country's representative for the 2021 contest with the song \"Amnesia\", but failed to progress from the first semi-final, finishing in 12th place." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christine Ott (born 10 August 1963) is a French pianist, vocalist, ondist, and composer. She was a member of Yann Tiersen's band for eight years and played in classical orchestras for ten. She has collaborated with Tindersticks, Syd Matters, and Jean-Philippe Goude. Ott has released three solo albums: Solitude Nomade in 2009, Only Silence Remains in 2016, and Chim√®res (pour Ondes Martenot) in 2020. She also composed the soundtrack for F. W. Murnau's Tabu in 2016. She has created several live soundtracks shows, including for Lotte Reiniger's movies and Robert J. Flaherty's Nanook of the North. Ott formed the duo Snowdrops with Mathieu Gabry in 2015. Together, they composed the original score for Manta Ray, by , and in 2020, they released the album Volutes, on Injazero Records. The Guardian selected the release among its ten best contemporary discs of 2020, writing, \"what's remarkable is how radically different Christine Ott manages to make the ondes sound on each track: from a primeval, guttural sound on the 13-minute Odysseus to a chirruping boy soprano on Ultraviolet.\"" ;

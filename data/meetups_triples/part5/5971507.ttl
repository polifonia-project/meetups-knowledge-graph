        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ricardo Trevi√±o Jr. (born May 16, 1971) is an American country music artist. Signed to Columbia Nashville in 1993, Trevino began his career that year with the release of his debut single \"Just Enough Rope\", the first mainstream country music single to feature separate English and Spanish versions. The song was included on his debut album Dos Mundos; a self-titled album followed a year later. Trevino has charted a total of fourteen singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and recorded seven studio albums. His highest-charting single, \"Running Out of Reasons to Run\", reached No. 1 on that chart in 1996." ;

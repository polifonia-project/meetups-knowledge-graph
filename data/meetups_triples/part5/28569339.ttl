        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mario Fargetta (born 19 July 1962, Lissone, Milan, Italy) is an Italian house/electronic DJ, producer, recording artist, composer, and remixer. He is best known for his involvement with the groups the Tamperer featuring Maya, and, since 2005, Get Far, which is a pseudonym of both his last name and his desire to take his musical direction beyond the Italian Dance sound, of which he has been associated with since the late 1980s. As Get Far, he reached the top of US Hot Dance Airplay chart in August 2010 with the club hit \"The Radio\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maja \"Maya\" Berović (Serbian Cyrillic: Маја Беровић; born 8 July 1987) is a Bosnian-Serbian singer. Born in Ilijaš, she began her recording career in 2007 with Život uživo. It was followed by moderately successful albums Crno zlato (2008), Maya (2011), Djevojka sa juga (2012) and Opasne vode (2014). Maya managed to gain more significant popularity by collaborating with Bosnian hip hop duo Jala Brat and Buba Corelli. With next albums - Viktorijina tajna (2017) and 7 (2018), she has become one of the most successful regional artists. Her duet with Buba Corelli, titled \"Pravo vreme\", remains one of the most viewed music videos by an Ex-Yu performer on YouTube. She also held a sold-out concert at Belgrade Arena in November 2018. Her eighth album, Intime, was released in 2020. Maya reached the milestone of one million followers on Instagram in October 2020." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alan Charles Jardine (born September 3, 1942) is an American musician, singer, and songwriter who co-founded the Beach Boys. He is best known as the band's rhythm guitarist and for occasionally singing lead vocals on singles such as \"Help Me, Rhonda\" (1965), \"Then I Kissed Her\" (1965), \"Cotton Fields\" (1970), and \"Come Go with Me\" (1978). His song \"Lady Lynda\" was also a UK top 10 hit for the group in 1978. Other Beach Boys songs that feature Jardine on lead include \"I Know There's an Answer\" (1966), \"Vegetables\" (1967), and \"From There to Back Again\" (2012). Following the death of fellow band member Carl Wilson in 1998, Jardine left the touring Beach Boys and has since performed as a solo artist, rejoining the band only for their 2012 50th anniversary tour. Since 2013, Jardine has toured as part of Beach Boys founder Brian Wilsonâ€™s band. He has released one solo studio album, A Postcard from California (2010). Jardine was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys in 1988." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Claude Antoine Marie François (French pronunciation: ​[klod ɑ̃twan maʁi fʁɑ̃swa]; 1 February 1939 – 11 March 1978), also known by the nickname Cloclo, was a French pop singer, composer, songwriter, record producer, drummer and dancer. François co-wrote the lyrics of \"Comme d'habitude\" (composed by Jacques Revaux), the original version of \"My Way\" and composed the music of \"Parce que je t'aime mon enfant\", the original version of \"My Boy\". Among his other famous songs are \"Le Téléphone Pleure\", \"Le lundi au soleil\", \"Magnolias for Ever\" and \"Alexandrie Alexandra\". He also enjoyed considerable success with French-language versions of English-language songs, including \"Belles! Belles! Belles!\" (The Everly Brothers' \"Made to Love\"), \"Cette année là\" (\"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\") and \"Je vais à Rio\" (\"I Go to Rio\"). François sold some 35 million records during his career (and after his death) and was about to embark for the United States when he was accidentally electrocuted in March 1978 at age 39. Former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing is quoted as saying Claude François was, to him, \"the French equivalent of The Beatles, meaning the great talent of a generation\"." ;

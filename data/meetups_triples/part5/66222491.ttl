        mtp:hasAbstract        "Iqbal Qureshi (12 May 1930 â€” 21 March 1998) was an Indian music composer and director, credited with film scores for several Hindi films between 1958 and 1986, best known for his music to the song \"Ek Chameli Ke Mandve Tale\" in the film Cha Cha Cha (1964), the first Indian film to feature Western dance. His interest in music began as a child when he sang for private gatherings and for All India Radio. He became involved in the Indian People's Theatre Association when he moved to Mumbai as an adult and began to direct music for dramas. His first credit was for composing music for the film Panchayat (1958), and subsequent films included Bindiya (1960), Love in Simla (1960), Banarsi Thug (1962) and then Yeh Dil Kisko Doon (1963). His compositions have included music for songs sung by Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, Mahendra Kapoor, and three Mangeshkar sisters; Lata, Asha and Usha. His music has provided the sound to lyrics by Makhdoom Mohiuddin, Neeraj and Kaifi Azmi. Actors including Helen, Joy Mukherjee, Sadhana, Manoj Kumar and Shashi Kapoor have performed to his tunes. His later work included composing the music in Alam Ara (1973), the remake of the first Indian talkie film Alam Ara (1931)." ;

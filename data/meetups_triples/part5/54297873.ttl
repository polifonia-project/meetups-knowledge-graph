In the 2017 Virginia elections she was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, winning the Democratic primary for the 13th district on June 13, and the general election on November 7. She is the first out transgender person to be elected to the Virginia General Assembly, and in January 2018 became the first to both be elected and serve while openly transgender in any U.S. state legislature. In December 2017 The Advocate named her as a finalist for its \"Person of the Year\". In January 2018, Roem was included on the cover of Time magazine in their \"The Avengers\" feature, highlighting new women candidates and elected officials from around the country. In 2018, Roem earned the Gainesville Times / Prince William Times \"Readers Choice Award\" for \"Best Local Politician\" because of her focus on constituent service.

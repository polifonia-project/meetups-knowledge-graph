        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carrie Minetta Jacobs-Bond (August 11, 1862 â€“ December 28, 1946) was an American singer, pianist, and songwriter who composed some 175 pieces of popular music from the 1890s through the early 1940s. She is perhaps best remembered for writing the parlor song \"I Love You Truly\", becoming the first woman to sell one million copies of a song. The song first appeared in her 1901 collection Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose, along with \"Just Awearyin' for You\", which was also widely recorded. Jacobs-Bond's song with the highest number of sales immediately after release was \"A Perfect Day\" in 1910. A 2009 August 29 NPR documentary on Jacobs-Bond emphasized \"I Love You Truly\" together with \"Just Awearyin' for You\" and \"A Perfect Day\" as her three great hits. Jacobs-Bond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970." ;

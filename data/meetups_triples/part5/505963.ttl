        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Louis Bartholomew (December 24, 1918 â€“ June 23, 2019) was an American musician, bandleader, composer, arranger, and record producer. He was prominent in the music of New Orleans throughout the second half of the 20th century. Originally a trumpeter, he was active in many musical genres, including rhythm and blues, big band, swing music, rock and roll, New Orleans jazz, and Dixieland. In his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he was cited as a key figure in the transition from jump blues and swing to R&B and as \"one of the Crescent City's greatest musicians and a true pioneer in the rock and roll revolution\". Many musicians have recorded Bartholomew's songs, but his partnership with Fats Domino produced some of his greatest successes. In the mid-1950s they wrote more than forty hits for Imperial Records, including the Billboard number one pop chart hit \"Ain't That a Shame\". Bartholomew's other hit songs as a composer include \"I Hear You Knocking\", \"Blue Monday\", \"I'm Walkin'\", \"My Ding-a-Ling\", and \"One Night\". He was a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame." ;

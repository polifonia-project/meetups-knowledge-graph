        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Dunmall (born 6 May 1953) is a British jazz musician who plays tenor and soprano saxophone, as well as the baritone and the more exotic saxello and the Northumbrian smallpipes. He has played with Keith Tippett and Barry Guy. In the early 1970s Dunmall joined progressive rock band \"Marsupilami\" for their second album, Arena. He toured with the band until it folded in September 1971 but played with the band on the Spirit of 1971 stage in 2011 at the Glastonbury Festival. He then became a member of the Divine Light Mission and toured the U.S. His first recording as sideman was as the saxophonist on the 1976 Johnny Guitar Watson album Ain't That a Bitch." ;

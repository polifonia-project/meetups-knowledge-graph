Born and raised in Tirana, Mumajesi began his career at an early age and rose to significant recognition after his participations in Kënga Magjike and his eventual win in 2018. He resumed his earlier career in 2011 with his debut studio album \"Detaj\" which incorporated musical elements from all of his previous records. Mumajesi established his own record label \"Threedots\" with whom he produced more than a dozen records for many recording artists across Albania and the Balkans. He is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades including the Balkan Music Award, Kënga Magjike Award and Top Fest Award." ;

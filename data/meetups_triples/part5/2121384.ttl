        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sheila Jordan (born Sheila Jeanette Dawson; November 18, 1928) is an American jazz singer and songwriter. She has recorded as a session musician with an array of critically acclaimed artists in addition to recording her own albums. Jordan pioneered a bebop and scat jazz singing style with an upright bass as the only accompaniment. Jordan's music has earned praise from many critics, particularly for her ability to improvise lyrics; Scott Yanow describes her as \"one of the most consistently creative of all jazz singers.\" Charlie Parker often introduced Jordan as \"the lady with the million dollar ears.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Malaika (born Malaika LeRae Sallard, January 2, 1972, in Seattle, Washington) also known under name Malaika Sallard Johnson, is a female African American dance singer from Seattle, Washington. During her short lived music career she recorded only one album entitled Sugar Time, which managed two Top 5 hits on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, including her number #1 single, \"Gotta Know (Your Name)\" in 1993. Sallard is tied with another A&M recording artist, CeCe Peniston, who took her own chances by performing backup vocals on the Overweight Pooch's album record Female Preacher in 1991, originally intended for Malaika." ;

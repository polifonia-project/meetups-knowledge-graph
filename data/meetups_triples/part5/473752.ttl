        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sophie Michelle Ellis-Bextor (born 10 April 1979) is an English singer and songwriter. She first came to prominence in the late 1990s, as the lead singer of the indie rock band Theaudience. After the group disbanded, Ellis-Bextor went solo, achieving success in the early 2000s. Her music is a mixture of mainstream pop, disco, nu-disco, and 1980s electronic influences. Ellis-Bextor's debut solo album, Read My Lips, was released in 2001. It peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry; it sold 1.5 million copies worldwide. Three of its four singles—the Cher cover \"Take Me Home\", \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" and the double A-side \"Get Over You\" / \"Move This Mountain\"—reached the top three in the UK. In 2003, Read My Lips won the Edison Award for Best Dance Album. Its follow-up Shoot from the Hip (2003) reached number 19 in the UK and spawned two top ten singles, \"Mixed Up World\" and \"I Won't Change You\". Ellis-Bextor's third studio album, Trip the Light Fantastic (2007), peaked at number seven in the UK and its lead single \"Catch You\" reached the top ten. Her fourth studio album, Make a Scene (2011), and its third single \"Bittersweet\" achieved top 40 positions in the UK. Her fifth studio album, Wanderlust (2014), peaked at number four, becoming her highest-charting album since Read My Lips. She released her Latin-inspired sixth studio album Familia in 2016 to critical acclaim." ;

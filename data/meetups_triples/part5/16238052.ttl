        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eddie Preston (May 9, 1925 – June 22, 2009) was an American jazz trumpeter. He was born in Dallas, Texas and died in Palm Coast, Florida. Preston began playing in big bands after World War II, and did stints with Lionel Hampton (1955–56), Ray Charles (1959), Louis Jordan (1960–61), Duke Ellington (1962), and Count Basie (1963). He played with Charles Mingus between 1963 and 1965 and again in 1969–72, with the time in between spent freelancing with musicians such as Sonny Stitt and Frank Foster. He played again with Ellington in 1971 and then did some work as a leader, as well as working with Roland Kirk in 1977 and Archie Shepp in 1979." ;

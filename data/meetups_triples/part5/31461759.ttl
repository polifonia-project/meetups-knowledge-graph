        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jesse Willard \"Pete\" Carr (April 22, 1950 â€“ June 27, 2020) was an American guitarist. Carr contributed to successful recordings by Joan Baez, Luther Ingram, Bob Seger, Joe Cocker, Boz Scaggs, Paul Simon, The Staple Singers, Rod Stewart, Barbra Streisand, Wilson Pickett, Hank Williams, Jr., among many others, from the 1970s onward. Carr recorded and produced four solo albums and was half of the duet LeBlanc and Carr. He recorded extensively at FAME Recording Studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama. He was lead guitarist for the famed Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Carr was known for versatility, using both electric and acoustic guitars to perform a vast array of musical styles including folk, rock, pop, country, blues and soul. In addition, Carr added depth to his understanding of the recording studio environment by engineering and producing numerous albums over the years which has led to several Grammy nominations. In 1974, Paul Simon's There Goes Rhymin' Simon album was nominated for two Grammy Awards; and Against the Wind by Bob Seger earned two Grammys in 1981. In addition, Carr co-produced Seger's Stranger in Town album which featured the hit \"Old Time Rock and Roll\"." ;

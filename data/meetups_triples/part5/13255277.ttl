He was one of the participants on the American reality series Nashville, which aired on Fox for two episodes before its cancellation in mid-2007. In late 2007, he signed to RCA Records Nashville as a recording artist, with his debut single \"Stealing Cinderella\" being released in September of that year. It served as the lead-off to his debut album Starting Now, which was released in January 2008. \"All I Ever Wanted\" and \"Man of the House\" were released as the album's second and third singles, respectively, and both have charted in the Top 40 as well." ;

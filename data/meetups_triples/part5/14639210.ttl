        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jimmy Wakely (February 16, 1914 â€“ September 23, 1982) was an American actor, songwriter, country music vocalist, and one of the last singing cowboys. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, he released records, appeared in several B-Western movies with most of the major studios, appeared on radio and television and even had his own series of comic books. His duet singles with Margaret Whiting from 1949 until 1951, produced a string of top seven hits, including 1949's number one hit on the US country chart and pop music chart, \"Slippin' Around\". Wakely owned two music publishing companies in later years, and performed at the Grand Ole Opry until shortly before his death." ;

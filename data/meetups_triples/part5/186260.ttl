He rose to prominence as the lead singer of the boy band B2K. The group achieved success in the early 2000s with their singles \"Gots ta Be\", \"Uh Huh\", \"Girlfriend\", and the number-one hit \"Bump, Bump, Bump\". After the group disbanded in 2004, Omarion embarked on a solo career, with the release of his debut solo album, O (2005), which debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 chart. He was also featured on the single \"Let Me Hold You\" by Bow Wow, which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. O received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. His second solo album, 21 (2006), became his second chart topper in the United States, and spawned the hit single \"Ice Box\". He released his third solo album, Ollusion in 2010. His fourth solo album, Sex Playlist (2014), spawned the single \"Post to Be\" (featuring Chris Brown and Jhené Aiko), which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified 3× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Omarion has also ventured into acting, with appearances in films such as You Got Served, Fat Albert, Somebody Help Me and The Proud Family Movie. As a solo artist, he has received a BET Award, a Billboard Music Award, and a Soul Train Music Award." ;

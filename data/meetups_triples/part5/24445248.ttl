        mtp:hasAbstract        "Wesley Johnson known by his stage name Wess (August 13, 1945 â€” September 21, 2009) was an American-born Italian singer and bass guitarist, perhaps mostly known for representing Italy along with Dori Ghezzi in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 in Stockholm, Sweden, placing third. Originally from North Carolina, Wess moved to Italy in the 1960s in pursuit of a musical career. He formed a successful duo with Ghezzi and achieved some hits in Italy, such as \"Voglio stare con te\", \"Come stai? Con chi sei?\" and \"Un corpo e un'anima\". Wess also was a singer and played bass guitar for the soul-funk band Wess & The Airedales in the 1960s and early 1970s. He died in New York during his United States tour when a breathing crisis led to his death." ;

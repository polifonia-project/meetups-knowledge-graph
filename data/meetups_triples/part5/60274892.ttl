After releasing several mixtapes between 2014 and 2018, he rose to mainstream prominence with his debut studio album Baby on Baby (2019), which included the Billboard Hot 100 top ten single \"Suge\". His second studio album, Kirk (2019), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album spawned the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) multi-platinum records \"Intro\" and \"Bop\". That same year, he was featured on the singles \"Enemies\" by Post Malone, and \"Cash Shit\" by Megan Thee Stallion. Dababy's third studio album, Blame It on Baby (2020), became his second consecutive number-one album in the US. The album included his highest-charting song, \"Rockstar\" (featuring Roddy Ricch), which spent seven non-consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and received a Grammy Award for Record of the Year nomination. His features on the 2020 singles \"Whats Poppin (remix)\" by Jack Harlow, and \"Levitating\" by Dua Lipa, both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. That same year, he appeared alongside Lil Baby on the top ten single \"For the Night\" by Pop Smoke.

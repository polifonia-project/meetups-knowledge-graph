Best known as a composer for Dutch television and film, Emmer has released four albums as a solo artist, each with a different theme or concept. Vogue Estate released in 1982, is the soundtrack for an imaginary film; 2007’s Recitement is a spoken word album of poetry and prose; International Blue, released in 2014, is a tribute to pop crooners. In 2017 Emmer released Home Ground, a neo-soul album that addresses social issues related to origin. Emmer is closely associated with the Dutch Ultra movement of late 1970s and early 1980s. He was a member of Minny Pops and the Lotus Eaters, co-founded the music magazine Vinyl and hosted and produced RadioNome for Dutch broadcasting organization VPRO." ;

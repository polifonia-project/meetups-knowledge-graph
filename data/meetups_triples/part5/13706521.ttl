        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carl William Bell (born January 9, 1967) is an American songwriter, record producer, arranger, engineer, and mixer. He founded the multi-platinum selling hard rock band Fuel in 1989, serving as the principal lyricist, lead guitarist, and record producer for the band during its inception and peak commercial success. He has written singles such as \"Shimmer\", \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\", and \"Bad Day\" as well as many other songs. He also co-produced all Fuel records including the Grammy nominated Natural Selection (2003). Although often a backing vocalist for the band, Bell never performed as a lead singer until releasing his first solo project in 2017. \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" was the No. 1 Active Rock song for 13 weeks and became the No. 5 Rock Song of the Decade, according to Billboard's Best of the 2000s Rock Songs Charts. In 2013, \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" became the No. 6 Alternative Rock song of the past 25 years, according to Billboard's Alternative Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs." ;

He also performs on flute, oboe, piccolo, and EWI (an electronic valve instrument made by Steiner, Crumar company). Allen is best known for his work with Sun Ra, having recorded and performed mostly in this context since the late 1950s, and having led The Sun Ra Arkestra since 1993, after Sun Ra's Death. Critic Jason Ankeny describes Marshall as \"one of the most distinctive and original saxophonists of the postwar era.\"" ;

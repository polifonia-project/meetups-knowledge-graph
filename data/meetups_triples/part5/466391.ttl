Between 1964 and July 1965, he was the lead guitarist of the rock band the Tea Set, a group that would later become Pink Floyd. Although he recorded a few songs with that band, he left before their transformation into Pink Floyd. However, on the band's official Facebook page, he has been repeatedly mentioned when discussing the band and their tenure as the Tea Set." ;

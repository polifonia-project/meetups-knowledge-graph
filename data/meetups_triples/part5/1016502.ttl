        mtp:hasAbstract        "Anastacia Lyn Newkirk (/ˌænəˈsteɪʒə/ AN-ə-STAY-zhə; born September 17, 1968) is an American singer, songwriter and former dancer. Her first two albums Not That Kind (2000) and Freak of Nature (2001) were released in quick succession to major success. Spurred on by the multi-platinum, global smash \"I'm Outta Love\", Anastacia was awarded as the 'World's Best-Selling New Female Pop Artist' in 2001. Her commercial success continued with international hits such as \"Paid My Dues\", \"One Day In Your Life\" and the official song of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, \"Boom\". After recovering from cancer, she returned with 2004's Anastacia which deviated from previous albums into pop-rock. Peaking at number one in 11 countries, it became Europe's second-biggest-selling album of the year. Its lead single \"Left Outside Alone\" remained at number one on the European Billboard chart for 15 weeks and helped Anastacia launch the most successful European tour by a solo artist that same year. The album also provided another three singles: \"Sick and Tired\", \"Welcome to My Truth\", and \"Heavy on My Heart\". In 2005, the multi-platinum compilation project Pieces of a Dream was released, which spawned the chart-topping duet with Eros Ramazzotti, \"I Belong to You (Il Ritmo della Passione)\". Her fourth studio album Heavy Rotation (2008) produced the songs \"Absolutely Positively\", \"Defeated\", and \"I Can Feel You\". Her cover album It's a Man's World (2012) was followed by a sixth studio album Resurrection (2014), which reached the top ten of several European charts. Her Ultimate Collection was released in 2015 and peaked in the top ten of the UK charts, giving the singer her sixth top-ten album in Britain. In 2017, Anastacia released the studio album Evolution and its lead single \"Caught in the Middle\". Anastacia has established herself as one of the best-selling international female singers of the 2000s and 2010s. As of 2016, she has reported worldwide sales of more than 50 million. She has had five top ten singles on U.S. Billboard's Dance Club chart and three albums on its Top Album Sales chart. Known for her powerful mezzo-soprano voice and her small stature of 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm), she has been dubbed \"the little lady with the big voice\". She underwent corrective LASIK surgery in August 2005, although she still frequently wears the glasses for which she became noted when she first became famous. During her life Anastacia has battled many health problems. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when she was 13, breast cancer at the age of 34, and supraventricular tachycardia aged 39. In 2013, Anastacia was diagnosed with breast cancer for a second time. In recognition of her decade-long charitable efforts in breast cancer awareness, Anastacia became the second woman ever to be presented with the Humanitarian Award at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in 2013." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Isaac Scott III (June 11, 1945 â€“ November 16, 2001), was an American blues guitarist and singer. He recorded a studio album in 1982, and a couple of live affairs in his lifetime, and was strongly linked to Seattle, Washington with its own blues scene, having moved to the city in the early 1970s. His influences included Albert Collins and Jimi Hendrix. Two of his obituaries noted that Scott might have achieved greater national fame, if he had been able to write his own material." ;

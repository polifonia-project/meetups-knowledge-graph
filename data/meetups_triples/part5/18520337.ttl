        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nathaniel Thompson (born 11 May 1983), better known professionally as Giggs, is a British rapper and songwriter from Peckham, London. He released his debut studio album Walk in da Park in 2008 and released a follow-up album Let Em Ave It the following year. Giggs released his third studio album When Will It Stop in October 2013. In 2016, Giggs released his fourth album Landlord, which entered and peaked at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart â€“ becoming the highest-charting album of his career. His mixtape Wamp 2 Dem was released in 2017 and also debuted at No. 2. His latest album Now or Never was released in 2020. Giggs is also the frontman and founder of record label and rap collective SN1 (Spare No 1), which includes Gunna Dee, Joe Grind, Kyze and Tiny Boost. While sometimes referred to as a grime MC, Giggs has repeatedly stated the music he makes is not grime, but rather falls under the UK rap umbrella." ;

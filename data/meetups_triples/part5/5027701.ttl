        mtp:hasAbstract        "Georg Valdemar Høeberg ( 27 December 1872 in Copenhagen – 3 August 1950 in Vedbaek ) was a Danish violinist, conductor and composer. He was the brother of the opera singer Albert Høeberg and cellist Ernst Høeberg and grandson of Hans Christian Lumbye. In 1888 he became a student at the Music Academy with George Ditleff Bondesen, Gade and Valdemar Tofte as teachers. The violin was his main instrument and he also studied the piano and composition. After further violin studies in Berlin he got a job as a violinist in the Royal Chapel from 1897 - 1901. At the same time he began composing, and in 1899 he received the Anckerske Scholarship. From 1900 he was additionally violin teacher at the Conservatory until 1914 when he became conductor of the Royal chapel as a replacement for Choquan Deez. He held this post until 1930. In the years from 1910 to 1914 he was head of the concerts in the Danish Concert Association and there proved his abilities as a conductor. His musical output was small and fell either before or after his conductorship." ;

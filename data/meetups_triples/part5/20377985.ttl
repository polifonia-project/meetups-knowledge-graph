        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bobby Austin (May 5, 1933 in Wenatchee, Washington â€“ January 6, 2002 in Camas, Washington) was an American country musician. Austin moved to Los Angeles in 1955, where he played bass in Wynn Stewart's band. He also worked as a session musician, for Buck Owens and Tommy Collins, among others, before being signed by Capitol Records as a solo artist in 1962. His \"Apartment No. 9\", written with Johnny Paycheck, was a hit for Tammy Wynette, in addition to reaching No. 21 on the U.S. country charts with his own version. He also co-wrote \"Try a Little Kindness\" which became a hit for Glen Campbell." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Joseph Radke (/ˈrædki/; born December 15, 1983) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, musician, and record producer best known for being the current lead singer of Falling in Reverse and the former lead singer of Escape the Fate. Radke rose to popularity as the lead singer for post-hardcore band Escape the Fate, but was kicked out in 2008 after being sentenced to prison for violating probation to owning brass knuckles in the state of Nevada in 2006. While in prison, Radke started a new band, Falling in Reverse, that didn't make a formal announcement until his release in December 2010. Radke spent much of his time writing for his new band. As a solo musician, Radke released a rap mixtape, Watch Me, in 2014, which included collaborations with Deuce, b.LaY, Tyler Carter, Sy Ari Da Kid, Jacoby Shaddix, Danny Worsnop, Andy Biersack, and Craig Mabbitt." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ruby Lovett (born February 16, 1967 in Laurel, Mississippi) is an American country music singer-songwriter. Lovett was put up for adoption as a baby. She cut a 45 rpm recording of \"One Day at a Time\" and \"Me and Jesus\" when she was 6 years old. She later entered local talent contests and won the True Value Country Showdown three years in a row. She started writing songs at age 10 and formed a band at age 13. Lovett's mother encouraged her to perform but also to get an education. She studied to become a Radiographer and was working at a hospital in Nashville when she was offered a recording contract. Lovett signed with Curb Records who released her debut album, Ruby Lovett, in January 1998. Its only single, \"Look What Love Can Do\", peaked at number 73 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart." ;

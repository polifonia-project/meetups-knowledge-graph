        mtp:hasAbstract        "James William Woodring (born October 11, 1952) is an American cartoonist, fine artist, writer and toy designer. He is best known for the dream-based comics he published in his magazine Jim, and as the creator of the anthropomorphic cartoon character Frank, who has appeared in a number of short comics and graphic novels. Since he was a child, Woodring has experienced hallucinatory \"apparitions\", which have inspired much of his surreal work. He keeps an \"autojournal\" of his dreams, some of which have formed the basis of some of his comics. His most famous creation is fictionalâ€”the pantomime comics set in the universe he calls the Unifactor, usually featuring Frank. These stories incorporate a highly personal symbolism largely inspired by Woodring's belief in Vedanta from Hindu philosophy. He also does a large amount of surrealist painting, and has been the writer on a number of comics from licensed franchises published by Dark Horse and others. Woodring identified Bimbo's Initiation as \"one of the things that laid the foundation for my life's philosophy.\" Woodring has won or been nominated for a number of awards. He placed twice on The Comics Journal's list of the 100 best comics of the century, with the Frank stories ranked #55, and The Book of Jim ranked #71." ;

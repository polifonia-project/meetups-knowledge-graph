        mtp:hasAbstract        "Fernanda Andrielli Nascimento Dos Santos (born in São Paulo, October 7, 1998), known professionally as MC Dricka, is a Brazilian singer-songwriter whose music consists mostly of the dirty funk genre. She earned the nickname \"Rainha dos Fluxos (Queen of Flows)\" for her success at favelas parties in São Paulo. Dricka is known for her aggressive music and direct lyrics, written with the purpose of elevating women's self-esteem. She is also recognized for being one of the first break-out woman artists in a male-dominated space. She is known as one of the empowering voices and advocates of funk music, famous for popularizing the rhythm of São Paulo's favelas throughout Brazil and the world." ;

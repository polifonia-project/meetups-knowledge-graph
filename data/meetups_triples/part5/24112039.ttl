Described by Donald Rosenberg of The Plain Dealer as \"a musician of myriad superlative qualities\" and by Allan Kozinn of The New York Times as a \"a poised, assured player with a solid technique\", Pompa-Baldi won the first prize in the 1999 Cleveland International Piano Competition. He was also a prizewinner of the 1998 Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition and the 2001 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.

Before 1849 she married Italian cellist and composer and moved with him to Oporto. Her opera Haydée was performed in Oporto in 1849 and again at the Teatro Dona Maria in Lisbon in 1853, where Casella sang in the principal role. Her next opera Cristoforo Colombo was performed in 1865 at the Théâtre Impérial in Nice." ;

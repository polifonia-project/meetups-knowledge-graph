Born in Isale Eko, she relocated to London at the age of 11 for her secondary education. Five years later, she began her music career doing backup vocals for artists such as George Michael and Mary J. Blige. After participating in the UK edition of The X Factor and graduating from Berklee College of Music, Savage signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2009. Inspired by the growth of the Nigerian music industry, Savage moved back to Nigeria and signed with Mavin Records in 2012. She made an appearance on the label's 2012 compilation album Solar Plexus. Her debut studio album Once Upon a Time was released on the 3rd of July 2013. It was supported by seven singles: \"Kele Kele Love\", \"Love Me (3x)\", \"Without My Heart\", \"Ife Wa Gbona\", \"Folarin\", \"Olorun Mi\" and \"Eminado\". The album was nominated for Best Album of the Year at the 2014 Nigeria Entertainment Awards and for Best R&B/Pop Album at The Headies 2014. Savage's second studio album R.E.D was released on 19 December 2015. It yielded two singles: \"My Darlin\" and \"Standing Ovation\". In June 2016, Savage signed a management and publishing deal with Roc Nation. In September 2017, she released her debut EP Sugarcane.

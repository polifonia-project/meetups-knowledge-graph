Dellentash has been reluctant to discuss his criminal life saying \"he keeps his past locked in a shadowy corner of his mind.\" In 2014 Dellentash was diagnosed with cancer, and it motivated him to reveal his story. As of 2016 Dellentash's stage-four cancer was in remission. In September 2015 Fox Searchlight purchased the option to make a film of Dellentash's career based on Jeff Maysh's article The Man Who Got America High published by Narratively magazine. Lucas Ochoa and Thomas Benski were named as producers by Pulse Films." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martin Lee Gore (born 23 July 1961) is an English songwriter, musician, singer, record producer and DJ. He is one of the founding members of the electronic rock band Depeche Mode and is the band's main songwriter. He is the band's guitarist and keyboardist, and occasionally provides lead vocals. Gore possesses a tenor singing voice which contrasts with Dave Gahan's dramatic baritone. He is also known for his flamboyant and (sometimes) androgynous stage persona. Gore has also released several solo albums and collaborated with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke as part of VCMG. Gore's songs include themes such as sex, religion and politics. He has said he feels lyrical themes that tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds \"happy songs\" fake and unrealistic. At the same time, he asserts that the band's music contains \"an element of hope\". In 1999, he received the Ivor Novello Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors for \"International Achievement\". He was given the Moog Innovation Award \"for his many contributions to the exploration of sound in popular music\" in 2019, and became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member in late 2020 with fellow active Depeche Mode members Dave Gahan and Andy Fletcher, as well as past members Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder. Following the death of Fletcher in May 2022, Gore is the longest-serving member of the band." ;

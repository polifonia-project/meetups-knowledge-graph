        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clive Nolan (born 30 June 1961) is a British musician, composer and producer who has played a prominent role in the development of progressive rock. He has been the regular keyboard player in Pendragon (1986–present), Shadowland (1992–present), (1993–1994) and Arena (1995–present), as well as writing lyrics for Arena and producing or co-producing several other bands' albums. At the age of sixteen, Nolan became the youngest musician in England (at the time) to gain an A.L.C.M. composition diploma from the London College of Music. In 1982, Nolan won the cup and two medals at the composers competition in the Cheltenham Music Festival. Nolan is a music graduate, holding both a B Mus and M Mus. He played violin, cello and viola, although his main study while at university was composition, orchestration, musical arrangement and conducting. In 2008 Nolan's rock opera, She, was filmed for DVD in Katowice, Poland. In 2010 the show was again performed in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Since then, Nolan has started the Caamora Theatre Company," ;

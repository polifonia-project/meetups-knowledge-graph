        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cass McCombs (born November 13, 1977 in California) is an American musician and songwriter. Since 2002 he has released ten albums, an EP and a B-sides compilation under his own name. McCombs’ music blends elements of many styles including American roots music, underground music, country, psychedelia and international music. His satirical lyrics, often the focal point, touch on the ambiguities between the personal, the political, mortality and nature. In 2016, the New York Times referred to McCombs as “one of the great songwriters of his time.” McCombs released his debut EP Not The Way (2002), debut album A (2003) and follow-up Prefection (2005) via Monitor Records and 4AD. His early work was critically acclaimed and quickly earned him a devoted following. In 2007 McCombs signed to Domino Records and released Dropping the Writ. His fourth album Catacombs (2009), produced by Ariel Rechtshaid, significantly increased his exposure and was followed by a pair of well-received albums in 2011, Wit’s End and Humor Risk. Big Wheel and Others, a double album, was released in 2013. Spin called it \"a towering achievement.\" His final release on Domino was the b-sides and rarities collection A Folk Set Apart: Rarities, B-Sides & Space Junk, ETC. (2015). McCombs signed to ANTI- Records in 2016 and released Mangy Love, which NME referred to as \"McCombs’ richest ever recording.\" In 2019 he released his ninth studio album, Tip of the Sphere, and published his debut poetry collection, Toy Fabels, with Spurl Editions." ;

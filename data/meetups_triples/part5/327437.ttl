        mtp:hasAbstract        "Israel Kaʻanoʻi Kamakawiwoʻole (Hawaiian pronunciation: [kəˌmɐkəˌvivoˈʔole]; meaning 'the fearless eye, the bold face'; May 20, 1959 – June 26, 1997), also called Bruddah Iz or just simply IZ, was a Hawaiian musician, singer, songwriter, and Hawaiian sovereignty activist. He achieved commercial success outside Hawaii when his album Facing Future was released in 1993. His medley of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World\" was released on his albums Ka ʻAnoʻi and Facing Future, and was subsequently featured in several films, television programs, and television commercials. The song spent 185 weeks on top of the World Digital Songs chart, making it the longest-leading number-one hit on any of the Billboard song charts. Along with his ukulele playing and incorporation of other genres, such as jazz and reggae, Kamakawiwoʻole remains influential in Hawaiian music, and is seen by many as the best Hawaiian musician of all time. He was named \"The Voice of Hawai‘i\" by NPR in 2010." ;

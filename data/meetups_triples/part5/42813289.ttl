In his youth, Thoroddsen studied guitar in Iceland. He later attended the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, California, graduating in 1982. Thoroddsen has released a number of albums.

Björn's band Guitar Islancio was also the first band in Iceland to receive a gold record for a jazz record in 2003. Björn has collaborated with many musicians during his career such as Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Kazumi Watanabe, Tommy Emmanuel, Robin Nolan, Philip Catherine, Didier Lockwood, Jørgen Svare and others.

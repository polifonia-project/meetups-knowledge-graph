        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronnie Lee Milsap (born Ronald Lee Millsaps; January 16, 1943) is an American country music singer and pianist. He was one of country music's most popular and influential performers of the 1970s and 1980s. Nearly completely blind from birth, he became one of the most successful and versatile country \"crossover\" singers of his time, appealing to both country and pop music markets with hit songs that incorporated pop, R&B, and rock and roll elements. His biggest crossover hits include \"It Was Almost Like a Song\", \"Smoky Mountain Rain\", \"(There's) No Gettin' Over Me\", \"I Wouldn't Have Missed It for the World\", \"Any Day Now\", and \"Stranger in My House\". He is credited with six Grammy Awards and 35 number-one country hits, third to George Strait and Conway Twitty. He was selected for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2014." ;

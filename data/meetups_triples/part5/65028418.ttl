        mtp:hasAbstract        "Luis \"Checho\" Orlando González Jiménez (born June 21, 1933) is a Chilean musician. He is most notable for having created \"Mi General Augusto Pinochet\", a song that glorifies Pinochet and his military dictatorship that lasted from 1973 to 1990. In the 1950s, he was a member of several musical trios, including \"Los González\", \"Los Mantles\" and \"Los Mineros\", and composed songs with Rubí Jáuregui. In the 2010 Copiapó mining accident he accompanied the relatives in the Esperanza camp. Through the record labels he created, he delivered \"Dragones\" and \"Boyas\" de Plata (characteristic symbols of his hometown). These awards were also presented at the Festival of the Elderly held in 2003 with Checho's own funding." ;

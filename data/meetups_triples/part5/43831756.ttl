Some of his records were released under the pseudonyms Sluefoot Joe and Barefoot Bill from Alabama. His best-remembered recording is \"Mamlish Blues\". Colin Larkin noted in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music that \"Bell stands as the most influential Alabama artist in pre-war blues recordings.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Walfredo Reyes Jr. (born Walfredo de los Reyes Palau IV; December 18, 1955) is a Cuban American musician who is an expert in drum set and auxiliary percussion, a music educator, and a clinician. He has performed with many jazz, Latin, World music, World fusion, Afro-Cuban, and rock bands as a touring, session recording, and full-time player/performer. Reyes is known for his fusion of many of the world's percussion techniques, including the ability to play a drum set with his hands in addition to the traditional use of drumsticks, whereby it is said that he can \"sound like a drummer and a percussionist at the same time\". He is well known for having been a long-term member of Santana, and a member of Chicago as the percussionist from 2012 to 2018 and took over the drum seat in 2018. He also performs in ex-Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton's solo band." ;

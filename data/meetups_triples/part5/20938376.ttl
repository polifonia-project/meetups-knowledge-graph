        mtp:hasAbstract        "Costadinos Contostavlos (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Κοντόσταυλος; born 11 June 1987), better known by his stage name Dappy, is a British rapper and singer. He is the lead singer of the Camden-based hip hop and grime trio N-Dubz, with his cousin Tulisa and Fazer. He was known for his lack of dress sense and his love for what he describes as \"eye-catching headwear\". His trademark was wearing a selection of woolly chullos (sometimes referred to as \"Dappy hats\"), turning up one or both of the ear-flaps of the hat." ;

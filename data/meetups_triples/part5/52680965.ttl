        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Stuart Green (born November 5, 1985), known professionally as Thom Sonny Green, is an English drummer and electronic music producer. Green attended Leeds University, where he met the musicians with whom he would found the band Alt-J in 2007. The band released its debut album, An Awesome Wave, in 2012, followed by This Is All Yours in 2014. In 2016, Green released a solo album of electronic music entitled High Anxiety. The album was recorded over a span of several years while on tour with Alt-J, and reflects Green's medical problems with anxiety and major hearing loss due to Alport syndrome." ;

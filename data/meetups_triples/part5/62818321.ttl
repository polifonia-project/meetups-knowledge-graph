        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ana Lucrecia Taglioretti (25 December 1995 â€“ 7 January 2020) was a Paraguayan violinist and prodigy. Being born blind, Taglioretti started studying music at the age of five, beginning her education on the piano, later studying singing and finally specializing in the violin. She joined the National Symphonic Orchestra of Paraguay in April 2014, and was invited several times to participate in telethons, as well as United Nations Paraguay and Global Infancia events. Taglioretti also participated in both national and international musical festivals and performed with artists such as Carlos Vives, Rolando Chaparro and Lizza Bogado. On 23 September 2019 Taglioretti, along with other National Symphonic Orchestra musicians, participated in a benefit concert to help Paraguayan Chaco families affected by drought and wildfires. Taglioretti was found dead on the afternoon of 9 January 2020 in the apartment where she lived. Her autopsy showed she had not suffered a violent death." ;

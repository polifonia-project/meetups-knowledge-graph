        mtp:hasAbstract        "Åke Olof Sebastian Uddén (18 August 1903 in Lossa (now Låssa), Upplands-Bro Municipality, Stockholm County – 28 April 1987 in Stockholm) was a Swedish violist, composer, conductor and music educator. Uddén studied in Stockholm with Henrik Melcher Melchers and Julius Ruthström, and subsequently from 1926 to 1928 with Georges Caussade and Charles Tournemire at the Conservatoire de Paris. Uddén played viola in the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1943 until 1956. He was a teacher of counterpoint at the Royal College of Music from 1934 to 1970, and was also conductor of the Stockholm Academic Orchestra (1955–1985). His limited output, influenced by French music, includes a number of orchestral, vocal and chamber music works, among them a string trio written during his studies in Paris, and two string quartets." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sherali\" Joʻrayev (Uzbek: Sherali Joʻrayev / Шерали Жўраев, Russian: Шермат \"Шерали\" Джураев) is an Uzbek singer, songwriter, poet, and actor. He is the People's artist of Uzbekistan. He has been an influential figure in Uzbek cultural life for almost four decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1980s and 1990s. Joʻrayev's lyrics have incorporated a variety of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. Some of his lyrics have become part of everyday Uzbek vocabulary. While Joʻrayev usually writes both the music and lyrics to his songs, he has also used lines from the poems of Ali-Shir Nava'i, Babur, Jami, and Rumi in his songs. In 1988, Joʻrayev wrote a book entitled Bola dunyoni tebratar (The Child is the Master of Earth). He wrote the screenplay and played the leading role in the 1989 film Sherali va Oybarchin (Sherali and Oybarchin). He was a member of the Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan from 1990 to 1995. From 2002, Uzbek government authorities banned Joʻrayev's appearance on Uzbek television and radio. He fell out of favor with the Uzbek government for his critical remarks about the difficult economic situation in the country. In 2017, one year after the death of Islam Karimov, Joʻrayev was briefly shown on state television. Joʻrayev has won dozens of awards and nominations, including the title People's Artist of the Uzbek SSR (1987). In 1991, he received the Alisher Navoiy State Prize. On April 12, 2022, Jurayev received an order of \"El-yurt xurmati\" on his 75th anniversary." ;

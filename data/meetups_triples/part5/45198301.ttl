His compositional output mainly consisted of works for military bands. His best known work, Grand Overture of Quebec, was written in honour of Lady Mary Lennox, the daughter of the Duke of Richmond. It was first performed by the British Army's 60th Foot Regiment band on the occasion of the Duke of Richmond's visit to the Government House in Quebec City in February 1819." ;

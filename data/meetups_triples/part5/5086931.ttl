        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zbigniew Seifert (7 June 1946 – 15 February 1979) was a Polish jazz violinist. Seifert was born in Kraków, Poland. He played alto saxophone early in his career and was influenced by John Coltrane. He devoted himself to jazz violin when he began performing with the Tomasz Stańko Quintet in 1970, and became one of the leading modern jazz violinists. Seifert relocated to Germany in 1973, and worked with Hans Koller's Free Sound between 1974 and 1975. The following year, he performed alongside John Lewis at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Seifert later recorded with Oregon. He died of cancer at the age of 32, and is buried at Rakowicki Cemetery in Krakow." ;

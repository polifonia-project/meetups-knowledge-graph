        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joel Lee Brodsky (October 7, 1939 â€“ March 1, 2007) was an American photographer, best known for his photography of musicians, particularly his iconic \"Young Lion\" photographs of Jim Morrison. In his lifetime, he is credited with photographing over 400 album covers. Brodsky was born in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from Syracuse University in 1960. While working at a camera store in Brooklyn, he began a side career of photography and opened his own studio in 1964. Later Brodsky left the rock 'n' roll photography and focused on commercial work, shooting advertising campaigns for Revlon, Avon, DuPont and other companies.Since the beginning of the new century, there has been a worldwide revival of interest in Brodsky's rock 'n' roll pictures, with several exhibitions across the USA and in Europe. His artwork has been shown by the Govinda Gallery in Washington, DC [1], the Morrison Hotel Gallery [2], the Stax Museum in Memphis, the San Francisco Art Exchange[3] and the Snap Galleries in London, UK [4]." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Semmangudi Radhakrishna Srinivasa Iyer (25 July 1908 â€“ 31 October 2003) was an Indian Carnatic vocalist. He was the youngest recipient of the Sangeetha Kalanidhi awarded by the Music Academy in 1947, a distinction he holds to this day as of 2022, probably the only musician to receive that honour before reaching 40. He had received many other awards as well, including Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan from the Government of India, Rajya Sewa Nirata title from Travancore's erstwhile ruling family, Sangeet Natak Academy award (1953), Isai Perarignar from Government of Tamil Nadu and Kalidas Samman from Government of Madhya Pradesh. He was affectionately addressed as \"Semmangudi Maama\" (Semmangudi Uncle) by his disciples. He was also considered the \"Pitamaha\" or the grand sire of modern Carnatic Music. He was conferred with an honorary doctorate by University of Kerala in 1979." ;

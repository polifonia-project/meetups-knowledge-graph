        mtp:hasAbstract        "Otha Lee Moore (May 22, 1930 â€“ August 16, 1964), better known as Tiny Topsy, was an American R&B singer. The music journalist, Mark Lamarr, noted \"Tiny in the same spirit you'd call a bald man curly, Tiny Topsy definitely had the lungpower to match her name.\" She was five feet tall and weighed 250 pounds. Although none of her seven single releases made the national charts, her early version of \"Just a Little Bit\" preceded bigger success for the song. Tiny Topsy was once believed to be an alias used by Bernice Williams (who wrote Tiny Topsy's track, \"Western Rock 'N' Roll\"), although pop historians now discount the idea." ;

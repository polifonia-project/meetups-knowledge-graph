He is best known for co-producing \"Goodbye\" with DJ Glenn Morrison, together with soundtracks for movies including Blade Runner 2049 and Ready Player One. His use of modular synthesis and isorhythms in his musical productions have brought him notice. Lange produced progressive house and deep house early in his career, before moving into techno production from 2015 onwards. Lange found his own label, Isorhythm, in 2011 as a platform to release his own music. He released his debut studio album, Ephemera, in 2015 through Mau5trap, which was later followed up with Isolated in 2020." ;

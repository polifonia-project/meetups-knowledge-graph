        mtp:hasAbstract        "Benjamin David Goodman (May 30, 1909 â€“ June 13, 1986) was an American clarinetist and bandleader known as the \"King of Swing\". From 1936 until the mid-1940s, Goodman led one of the most popular swing big bands in the United States. His concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City on January 16, 1938, is described by critic Bruce Eder as \"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's 'coming out' party to the world of 'respectable' music.\" Goodman's bands started the careers of many jazz musicians. During an era of racial segregation, he led one of the first integrated jazz groups, his quartet and quintet. He performed nearly to the end of his life while exploring an interest in classical music." ;

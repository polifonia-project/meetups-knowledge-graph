        mtp:hasAbstract        "Philip Thornalley (born 5 January 1960) is an English songwriter-producer who has worked in the music industry since 1978. He is perhaps best known for co-writing (with Scott Cutler and Anne Preven) the song \"Torn\" (made famous by Natalie Imbruglia's cover version, which he also produced) and the UK number one hits \"Mama Do\" and \"Boys and Girls\" for Pixie Lott. He also produced The Cure's 1982 album Pornography and was later their bass player for eighteen months, producing and performing the distinctive double bass line on their 1983 single \"The Love Cats\". In 1988, Thornalley released his only solo album Swamp and briefly joined the band Johnny Hates Jazz. He then worked principally as a songwriter for hire for many acts including Bryan Adams. In 2017 he joined Adams' band as bass player for 18 months before releasing two solo albums of his own seventies inspired music under the moniker Astral Drive." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Héloïse Adélaïde Letissier (French pronunciation: ​[elɔiz adelaid lətisje]; born 1 June 1988), known professionally as Christine and the Queens and Redcar, or occasionally simply Chris, is a French singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Nantes, he started learning piano at the age of four and found inspiration in one of London's clubs while studying. Letissier released a series of extended plays throughout 2011–2013. His debut album, Chaleur humaine (2014), received critical acclaim, reached number 2 on both French and UK charts, and was certified diamond in France; it was also a best selling debut record in the United Kingdom. In 2018, he released his second album, Chris, to further critical acclaim. It was ranked album of the year by Clash, The Guardian, and The Independent, and placed in top-ten of nine other year-end lists. \"Girlfriend\" was recognized by Time as song of the year. In reaction to his mother's death, Letissier released in 2020 an EP La Vita Nuova, with some critics calling it his strongest work up to that point. Time again named his song, \"People, I've Been Sad\", the song of the year. In 2016, Letissier was ranked number 1 in Vanity Fair's list of most powerful and influential French people who \"promote French genius\", ahead of the country's president. The next year, Forbes placed him on its list of 30 most influential and talented people under 30, and Time included him on its list of Next Generation Leaders twice – in 2016 and 2018. His accolades include four Victories of Music awarded by French Ministry of Culture. Christine and the Queens has been signed to the independent record label Because Music since 2012." ;

Emerging from Harlem in New York City in 1992, Coleman became known among underground hip-hop fans for his freestyling ability. He was eventually signed to Columbia Records, where, in 1995, he released his debut album, Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous. On February 15, 1999, Coleman was shot nine times in his East Harlem neighborhood and later died from his injuries. Noted for his use of wordplay, writers at AllMusic, HipHopDX and The Source have praised Coleman for his lyrical ability, He has also been described as \"one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip-hop history and known by many as the greatest punchline rapper of all time.\" Regarding Coleman's legacy in an interview with Funkmaster Flex, Nas claimed \"[Coleman] scared me to death. When I heard [his performance at the Apollo Theater] on tape, I was scared to death. I said, 'Yo, it's no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.'\"" ;

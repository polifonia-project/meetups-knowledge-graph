        mtp:hasAbstract        "Edoardo Bennato (born 23 July 1946, Naples, Campania, Italy) is an Italian singer-songwriter. He is the brother of the singer-songwriter Eugenio Bennato. He is considered one of the greatest Italian rockers, a genre that he has often combined with blues and folk. Guitarist, harmonica player and singer, he later began to propose himself as one-man band, playing at the same time also tambourines, kazoo and other percussions. His texts are often ironic, irreverent, and turned in a biting way against power, at any level and in any form it manifests. He was the first Italian singer to fill the San Siro Stadium in Milan with more than sixty thousand people on July 19, 1980, and the first Italian singer to perform at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1976. Also, Bennato was the first singer to have released two albums only 15 days apart in March 1980: Uffà! Uffà! and Sono solo canzonette." ;

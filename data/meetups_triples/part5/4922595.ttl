He has been well known as frontman of the rock band Anzen Chitai that debuted in 1982 and enjoyed a successful career, particularly during the 1980s. In 1993, he began his career as a solo artist, and since then he has experienced much critical acclaim. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Japanese vocalists, in 2014 he was ranked first by a panel of 200 experts for the best ever singing voice in Japan. Moreover, in June 2021 Koji was voted as the greatest active male Japanese singer, with 190 experts agreeing that he is a \"living national treasure of music\" and that he portrays an \"unparalleled mass of expressiveness and emotion which only seems to get better with age\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Victor Lawton Wainwright, Jr. (born February 4, 1981) is an American blues and boogie-woogie singer, songwriter, and pianist. Wainwright's musical style was described by the American Blues Scene magazine in 2013 as \"honky-tonk and boogie, with a dose of rolling thunder. Wainwright's playing is simply beautiful madness.\" Living Blues magazine noted that \"Wainwright serves as an electrifying guide to a good time â€“ spinning tales, telling his listeners how to beat the blues, and meticulously conjuring raw soul and energy out of his acoustic piano.\" Wainwright currently tours both nationally and internationally, performing with two bands: Victor Wainwright and the Train, and Southern Hospitality. Wainwright formerly toured as Victor Wainwright & the WildRoots." ;

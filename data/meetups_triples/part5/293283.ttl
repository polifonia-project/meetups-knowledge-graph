        mtp:hasAbstract        "Pauline Oliveros (May 30, 1932 â€“ November 24, 2016) was an American composer, accordionist and a central figure in the development of post-war experimental and electronic music. She was a founding member of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in the 1960s, and served as its director. She taught music at Mills College, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Oliveros authored books, formulated new music theories, and investigated new ways to focus attention on music including her concepts of \"deep listening\" and \"sonic awareness\", drawing on metaphors from cybernetics. She was an Eyebeam resident." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Valery Ponomarev, Russian: Вале́рий Миха́йлович Пономарёв, Valery Mikhaylovich Ponomaryov, (born 1943) is a Russian-born jazz trumpeter. He has lived in the United States since 1973. Ponomarev became interested in jazz after hearing it on Voice of America, and felt a particular affinity for Clifford Brown.He dedicated countless hours to transcribing, studying and memorizing legendary jazz trumpet solos. In time he decided to flee the then Soviet Union and ended up joining Art Blakey's group the Jazz Messengers. After leaving, he formed his own band, Universal Language. On September 9, 2006, his arm was broken in an altercation with security at Charles de Gaulle Airport. The altercation involved his intention of carrying his trumpet with him onto the plane. Ponomarev tours with his tribute big band, playing both originals and music from the Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers repertoire. He teaches privately, and released his autobiography On the Flip Side of Sound in 2009. He teaches as part of the Wells Fargo Jazz for Teens program in Newark, New Jersey." ;

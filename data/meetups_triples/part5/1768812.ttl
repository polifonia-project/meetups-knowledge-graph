As a prolific session musician, Burrows was involved in the production of numerous transatlantic hit singles throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, most of which were one-hit wonders, including \"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\" by Edison Lighthouse, \"United We Stand\" by Brotherhood of Man, \"My Baby Loves Lovin'\" by White Plains, \"Gimme Dat Ding\" by The Pipkins and \"Beach Baby\" by The First Class. During 1970, four singles by four different acts for whom he served as lead vocalist all charted at or near the top of the UK Singles Chart and additionally reached the top 20 in the United States." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Antón Álvarez Alfaro (born July 16, 1990), better known as C. Tangana, is a Spanish rapper and songwriter. He began his musical career while in high school, rapping under the pseudonym Crema and releasing a seven-track EP titled Él Es Crema (2005). He gained recognition in Spain as a member of the band Agorazein. In 2016, Tangana began performing as a solo act under the stage name C. Tangana. After releasing a number of singles in 2016, including \"Lo Hace Conmigo\", \"Los Chikos de Madriz\" and \"Antes de Morirme\", Tangana attained mainstream success in Spain with the release of \"Mala Mujer\", later included in his debut studio album Ídolo (2017). He continued to explore urbano and hip hop music on his mixtape Avida Dollars (2018), which spawned the top twenty single \"Llorando en la Limo\". Tangana continued to release standalone singles to commercial success such as \"Bien Duro\", \"Booty\" and \"Nunca Estoy\". He experimented with flamenco and Latin music on his second studio album El Madrileño (2021), which was nominated for the Premio Ruido and received a Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year. El Madrileño became the best-selling album in Spain in 2021. Throughout his career, C. Tangana has won nine Latin Grammy Awards as songwriter and as performer, two Premios Odeón and a LOS40 Music Award among others. He has also been nominated for a Grammy Award, two MTV Europe Music Awards and two UK Music Video Awards. Tangana's outspoken political views have received significant media coverage. Considered a controversial musical figure within the Spanish industry, he has been accused of proliferating sexist conducts through his lyrics. He has also been accused of being a \"sellout\" by colleague rappers. His pesimistic view on representative democracy, the monarchy and the Spanish royal family and his high-profile relationship with Rosalía, have also been topics of media attention." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Keenon Dequan Ray Jackson (born March 9, 1990), better known by his stage name YG (short for Young Gangsta), is an American rapper from Compton, California. In 2010, he released his debut single, \"Toot It and Boot It\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign), which peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single's success resulted in his signing to Def Jam Recordings. In the following years, YG released mixtapes such as The Real 4Fingaz, Just Re'd Up, Just Re'd Up 2, 4 Hunnid Degreez, among others. In June 2013, YG signed an additional deal with Young Jeezy's imprint CTE World. His 2013 single, \"My Nigga\" (featuring Jeezy and Rich Homie Quan), peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100. He then released the singles \"Left, Right\" (featuring DJ Mustard) and \"Who Do You Love?\" (featuring Drake), leading up to the release of his debut studio album in 2014. The album, My Krazy Life, was released in March of that year by Pu$haz Ink, CTE World and Def Jam, and receiving commercial success and critical acclaim. Later in 2014, he was featured on his highest-charting single to date, \"Don't Tell 'Em\", with American singer Jeremih, peaking at number 6 on the Hot 100. In 2016, he released his second album, Still Brazy, to further acclaim. In 2018, he released his third studio album, Stay Dangerous, to generally positive reviews. It included the single, \"Big Bank\" (featuring 2 Chainz, Big Sean and Nicki Minaj)â€”his highest charting solo single peaking at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. His fourth studio album, 4Real 4Real, was released in 2019 in memory of deceased rapper and close colleague Nipsey Hussle. His fifth and sixth studio albums, My Life 4Hunnid (2020) and I Got Issues (2022) followed thereafter." ;

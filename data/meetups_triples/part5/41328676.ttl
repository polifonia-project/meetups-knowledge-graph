        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gabriella Michelle Henderson (born 12 January 1996), known as Ella Henderson, is an English singer. She competed in the ninth series of The X Factor UK in 2012, finishing in sixth place despite being a strong favourite to win. She signed with Syco Music shortly after, and released her debut studio album, Chapter One (2014), which reached number one in the UK. The album spawned the chart-topping single \"Ghost\", as well as the top 20 singles \"Glow\" and \"Yours\". Henderson went on a four-year hiatus in 2015. Her second studio album, Everything I Didn't Say, was released in March 2022. In addition to solo material, she recorded several successful collaborations, including \"Glitterball\" with Sigma, \"Here for You\" with Kygo (both in 2015), \"This Is Real\" with Jax Jones, \"We Got Love\" with Sigala (both in 2019), \"Let's Go Home Together\" with Tom Grennan (2021), \"Crazy What Love Can Do\" with David Guetta and Becky Hill, and \"21 Reasons\" with Nathan Dawe (both in 2022), five of which reached the top 10 in the UK." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Justin Paul Jeffre (born February 25, 1973) is an American pop singer and politician. A long-time resident and vocal supporter of Cincinnati, Jeffre is probably best known as a member and bass singer of the multi-platinum-selling boy band 98 Degrees. The group thrived in the era of boy bands, including Boyz II Men, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. After releasing several popular albums in the late '90s and early 2000s, including their self-titled debut album, which was released in 1997 and went gold, and their multi-platinum album 98 Degrees and Rising, the boy band went on an extended hiatus. Jeffre has stayed out of the public eye for several years, instead focusing his attention on politics and activism." ;

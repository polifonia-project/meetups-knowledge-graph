        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eiichi Ohtaki (July 28, 1948 â€“ December 30, 2013) was a Japanese musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He first became known as a member of the rock band Happy End, but was better known for his solo work which began in 1972. In 2003, Ohtaki was ranked by HMV Japan at number 9 on their list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts. Patrick Macias referred to Ohtaki as Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, George Martin and Joe Meek \"synthesized into a single human being,\" and called his work \"an encyclopedia of everything that was great about pop music in the 20th century.\"" ;

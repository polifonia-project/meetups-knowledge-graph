She rose to fame in 2009, after competing in the second season of Italian talent show X Factor. Immediately after being eliminated from the competition, she released her debut single, \"Briciole\", which peaked at number 2 on the FIMI Singles Chart. As of 2022, she has released 6 studio albums, which spawned commercially successful singles such as \"Vuoto a perdere\", \"Sono solo parole\", \"La borsa di una donna\", \"Glicine\" and the chart toppers \"L'amore si odia\", featuring vocals by Fiorella Mannoia, and \"Per tutta la vita\". She dueted with Italian band Stadio and with rapper Fedez, among others, and her single \"Makumba\", a duet with Carl Brave, became a summer hit in 2021. Noemi performed songs for the soundtrack of Italian films Women vs. Men and Domani è un altro giorno, receiving a special Nastro d'Argento award in 2019. During her career, Noemi recorded songs written for her by well-known songwriters, including Vasco Rossi, Fabrizio Moro, Ivano Fossati, Tommaso Paradiso, Marco Masini, Federico Zampaglione, Giuliano Sangiorgi and Gaetano Curreri. She competed seven times in the Sanremo Music Festival between 2010 and 2022. She toured several times across Italy, performing in theatres, clubs and outdoor venues. Between 2013 and 2015, she was a coach for three seasons in The Voice of Italy, and in 2019 she appeared as a judge on the second season of Sanremo Young." ;

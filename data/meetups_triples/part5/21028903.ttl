He provides electronic sound manipulations and samples for the band. Weitz grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore and lives in Washington, DC. His nickname comes from a friend mistaking his major in college, as well as the headlamp he wears in order to see his electronic equipment during live shows." ;

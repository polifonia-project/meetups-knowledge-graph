She rose to prominence as a member of the less-known group called Energija, with whom she released three albums.

In 2011, she made a comeback with her third release Psiho, which featured a duet with Romanian artist Costi Ioniță, titled \"Idemo na sve\". She additionally received wide attention for winning the first series of Serbian television show Tvoje lice zvuči poznato in December of 2013. Kokić also starred as singer Silvana Armenulić in the movie Bićemo prvaci sveta (2015) and made her theatre debut in the comedy play Čekajući ministra in 2017.

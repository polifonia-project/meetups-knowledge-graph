        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ramchandra Narhar Chitalkar (12 January 1918 â€“ 5 January 1982), also known as C. Ramchandra or Chitalkar or Anna Sahib, was an Indian music director and playback singer. As a composer, he mostly used the name C. Ramchandra, though he also used the names Annasaheb (in the movies Bahadur Pratap, Matwale, and Madadgaar), Ram Chitalkar (in the movies Sukhi Jeevan, Badla, Mr. Jhatpat, Bahadur, and Dosti), and Shyamoo (in the movie Yeh hai duniya). Further, he often sang and acted in Marathi movies under the name R. N. Chitalkar. For his career as an occasional playback singer he used only his surname Chitalkar. Chitalkar sang some renowned and unforgettable duets with Lata Mangeshkar such as \"Kitna Haseen Hai Mausam\" in the film Azaad (1955) and \"Shola Jo Bhadke\" in Albela (1951)." ;

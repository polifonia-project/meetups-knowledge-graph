He rose to fame in 2018 with his single, \"Die Young\", which peaked at number 98 on the Billboard Hot 100. Ricch's first two mixtapes, Feed Tha Streets (2017) and Feed Tha Streets II (2018), also received widespread acclaim. In 2019, Ricch was featured alongside Hit-Boy on Nipsey Hussle's single, \"Racks in the Middle\", which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance, and on Mustard's Grammy-nominated single \"Ballin'\", which reached the top 20 of the Hot 100. Ricch's debut studio album, Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial, was released through Atlantic Records and Bird Vision Entertainment on December 6, 2019, and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming his first chart-topping album. It spawned the Hot 100 number-one single \"The Box\", which earned him a diamond certification by the RIAA, as well as the top ten single \"High Fashion\", which features Mustard. Later in 2020, Ricch's feature on DaBaby's single, \"Rockstar\", became his second number-one single on the Hot 100. His second studio album, Live Life Fast, was released on December 17, 2021. Ricch has won several accolades, including a Grammy Award from nine different nominations, as well as two BET Awards, two BET Hip Hop Awards, and an American Music Award." ;

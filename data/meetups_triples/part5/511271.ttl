        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sheena Shirley Easton (n√©e Orr; born 27 April 1959) is a Scottish-American singer and actress. Easton came into the public eye in an episode of the first British musical reality television programme The Big Time: Pop Singer, which recorded her attempts to gain a record contract and her eventual signing with EMI Records. Easton's first two singles, \"Modern Girl\" and \"9 to 5\", both entered the UK Top Ten. She became one of the most successful British female performers of the 1980s. A six-time Grammy nominee in the US, Easton is a two-time Grammy Award winner, winning Best New Artist in 1982 and Best Mexican-American Performance in 1985, for her duet with Luis Miguel on the song \"Me Gustas Tal Como Eres\". She has received five US Gold albums and one US Platinum album. She has recorded 15 studio albums, released 45 singles total worldwide, and had 20 consecutive US singles, including 15 US Top 40 singles, seven US Top Tens and one US #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1981 and 1991. She had 25 top 40 hits internationally. In Canada, Easton scored three gold and two platinum albums. She has sold over 30 million records worldwide. Easton became the first and only recording artist in Billboard history to have a top 5 hit on each of Billboard's primary singles charts: \"Morning Train (Nine to Five)\" (pop and AC), \"We've Got Tonight\" with Kenny Rogers (country and AC), and \"Sugar Walls\" (R&B and dance). Easton's other hits include the James Bond theme \"For Your Eyes Only\", \"Strut\", \"U Got the Look\" and \"The Arms of Orion\" with Prince, \"The Lover in Me\", and \"What Comes Naturally\". She has worked with prominent vocalists and producers, such as Prince, Christopher Neil, Kenny Rogers, David Foster, Luis Miguel, L.A. Reid & Babyface, Patrice Rushen, and Nile Rodgers." ;

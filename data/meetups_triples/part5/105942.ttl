He is the founder and owner of the record label Villain Entertainment. MC Ren began his career as a solo artist signed to Eazy-E's Ruthless Records in early 1987, while still attending high school. By the end of 1987, after having written nearly half of Eazy-Duz-It, he became a member of N.W.A. After the group disbanded in 1991, he stayed with Ruthless, releasing three solo albums including the controversial Shock of the Hour before leaving the label in 1998. In 2016, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of N.W.A." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jim Neversink (born Michael James Whitehead; 16 June 1969) is a South African musician, singer and songwriter. His musical style spans over indie rock, country, americana and punk. He is best known as a solo artist who performs with changing line-ups. As such, he has released three albums to critical acclaim; despite being released on independent labels, two of them were included in lists of best album of the year in South African magazines as well as in Billboard. Three South African newspapers also listed Neversink albums among their albums of the decade. Before he went solo, Neversink was the co-founder and lead guitarist of Famous Curtain Trick, a country/pop/rock band which rose to mainstream popularity in South Africa in the 1990s and was nominated for a SAMA Award. His most notable instrument is the guitar, including a home-built lap steel guitar." ;

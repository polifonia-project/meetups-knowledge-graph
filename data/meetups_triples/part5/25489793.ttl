        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Jay Blumenthal (born September 25, 1969), better known by his stage name Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal or just simply as Bumblefoot, is an American guitarist, songwriter, and producer. He adopted his nickname from the bacterial infection of the same name, which he learned about while helping his wife study for her veterinary exams. The name went from being just the name of an album, to the name of a record label, to a band name, to eventually his name as a solo artist. He was one of two lead guitarists in Guns N' Roses from 2006 until 2014 and performed on their sixth studio album Chinese Democracy. He is currently the guitarist for the supergroup Sons of Apollo and served as the guitarist and vocalist for the band Asia from 2019 to 2022. Since the early 1990s, Thal has released 10 solo albums and a live DVD. He has appeared as a guest performer on albums by other artists, and on numerous compilation albums. He has been the cover feature of GitarPlus magazine in Indonesia and has been featured in several foreign guitar magazines, as well as the subject of many print, radio and web interviews. Over the past twenty years, he has also worked with numerous bands and artists as producer, engineer, writer, arranger, and performer. He also writes TV jingles, theme songs, and background music." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eric Persing is a german sound designer, professional synthesist and producer in Los Angeles, California. He is best known as the Founder and Creative Director of the music software and virtual instrument company Spectrasonics. He has been a major contributor to all of Spectrasonics' products, including Omnisphere, Keyscape, Stylus RMX, Trilian, Atmosphere and Trilogy. Persing started working for the Roland Corporation as Chief Sound Designer from 1984 to 2004, where he worked on many influential synthesizers and music-related products such as the Roland D-50, the JD-800, the Roland JX, JV, JP, XP series synthesizers and many others. Even today, his sounds can be heard in many productions. At the 2011 NAMM Show, as part of a joint promotion with the Bob Moog Foundation, Persing exhibited the OMG-1 synthesizer, a unique synthesizer of his own design that integrated a Moog Little Phatty with an Apple Mac Mini and two iPads running virtual instruments, all housed in a custom curly maple cabinet. Important influences for Persing are Vangelis, Kraftwerk, Jan Hammer, Yes, Genesis and Thomas Dolby." ;

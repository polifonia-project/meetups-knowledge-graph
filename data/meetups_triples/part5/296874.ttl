        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Simmons Barth (/bɑːrθ/; born May 27, 1930) is an American writer who is best known for his postmodern and metafictional fiction. His most highly regarded and influential works were published in the 1960s, and include The Sot-Weed Factor, a satirical retelling of Maryland's colonial history, and Lost in the Funhouse, a self-referential and experimental collection of short stories. Though Barth's work has been controversial among critics and readers, he was co-recipient of the National Book Award in 1973 for his novel Chimera with John Williams for Augustus. Despite Barth's influence on postmodern literature in America, his influence and publicity have decreased since his novels were published." ;

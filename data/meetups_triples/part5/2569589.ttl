        mtp:hasAbstract        "Patricia Bredin (born 14 February 1935) is an English actress and one-time singer, who is best known as the first representative of the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest. She took part in the 1957 contest, held in Frankfurt and finished in seventh place out of ten entries with the song \"All\", the first ever song sung in English at Eurovision. At 1:52, \"All\" was for a long time the shortest performance in the history of the contest. The record was broken in 2015 when Finland's Pertti Kurikan Nimip채iv채t sang \"Aina mun pit채채\", which was only 1:27 long." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stephanie Young Hwang (born August 1, 1989), known professionally as Tiffany or Tiffany Young, is an American singer-songwriter. Born and raised in California, she was discovered by South Korean entertainment agency SM Entertainment at the age of fifteen and subsequently moved to South Korea. After two years of training, Young debuted as a member of girl group Girls' Generation (and later its subgroup Girls' Generation-TTS) in August 2007, which went on to become one of the best-selling artists in South Korea and one of South Korea's most popular girl groups worldwide. In 2016, Young became the second Girls' Generation member to debut as a soloist with the release of her first extended play I Just Wanna Dance. Although Young remains a member of Girls' Generation, she left SM Entertainment in October 2017. She is currently based in Los Angeles for her solo career. She joined Paradigm Talent Agency and signed with record label Transparent Arts prior to the release of her 2019 extended play Lips on Lips." ;

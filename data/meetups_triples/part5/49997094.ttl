Testa began musical performances in 1990 and in the early 1990s, he won two consecutive top prizes at the Recanati Festival. His first album \"Montgolfieres\" was issued in 1995 in a collaboration between the French Label Bleu and Harmonia Mundi. Throughout his musical career, Testa continued to work as a station master at the train station in Cuneo, Italy. He sang in Italian and French and his music bears resemblances to folk, jazz and world music." ;

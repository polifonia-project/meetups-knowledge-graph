        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gordon Haskell (27 April 1946 â€“ 15 October 2020) was an English musician and songwriter. A pop, rock, jazz, country and blues vocalist, guitarist, and bassist, he was a school friend of King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp. The two first worked together in Fripp's mid-1960s teenage group the League of Gentlemen (not to be confused with Fripp's later new wave band). Haskell gained recognition as bass player for The Fleur de Lys in 1966, and subsequently spent a short period in King Crimson. He sang on the album In the Wake of Poseidon (1970), and sang and played bass on Lizard (1971). After leaving King Crimson, Haskell continued as a solo musician, reaching international fame in 2001 with his hit \"How Wonderful You Are\" and the platinum-selling album Harry's Bar." ;

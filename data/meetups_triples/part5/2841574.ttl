        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gwyneth Herbert (born 26 August 1981) is a British singer-songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. Initially known for her interpretation of jazz and swing standards, she is now established as a writer of original compositions, including musical theatre. She has been described as \"an exquisite wordsmith\" with \"a voice that can effortlessly render any emotion with commanding ease\" and her songs as being \"impressively crafted and engrossing vignette[s] of life's more difficult moments\". Three of her six albums have received four-starred reviews in the British national press. Another album, Between Me and the Wardrobe, received a five-starred review in The Observer. Her seventh album, Letters I Haven't Written, was released in October 2018." ;

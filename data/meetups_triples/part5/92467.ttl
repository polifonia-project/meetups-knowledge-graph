        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jimmy Rogers (June 3, 1924 â€“ December 19, 1997) was an American Chicago blues singer, guitarist and harmonica player, best known for his work as a member of Muddy Waters's band in the early 1950s. He also had a solo career and recorded several popular blues songs, including \"That's All Right\" (now a blues standard), \"Chicago Bound\", \"Walking by Myself\" (his sole R&B chart appearance), and \"Rock This House\". He withdrew from the music industry at the end of the 1950s, but returned to recording and touring in the 1970s." ;

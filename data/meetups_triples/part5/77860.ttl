        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Alec Entwistle (9 October 1944 â€“ 27 June 2002) was an English musician who was the bassist for the rock band The Who. Entwistle's music career spanned over four decades. Nicknamed \"The Ox\" and \"Thunderfingers\", he was the band's only member with formal musical training and also provided backing and occasional lead vocals. Entwistle was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Who in 1990. Renowned for his musical abilities, Entwistle's instrumental approach used pentatonic lead lines and a then-unusual treble-rich sound (\"full treble, full volume\"). He was voted as the greatest bassist ever in a 2011 Rolling Stone readers' poll and, in 2020, the same magazine ranked him number three in its own list of the 50 greatest bassists of all time." ;

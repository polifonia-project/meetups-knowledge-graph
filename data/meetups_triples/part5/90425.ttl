        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Vernon \"Big Joe\" Turner Jr. (May 18, 1911 â€“ November 24, 1985) was an American singer from Kansas City, Missouri. According to songwriter Doc Pomus, \"Rock and roll would have never happened without him.\" His greatest fame was due to his rock-and-roll recordings in the 1950s, particularly \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\", but his career as a performer endured from the 1920s into the 1980s. Turner was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, with the Hall lauding him as \"the brawny voiced 'Boss of the Blues'\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tomi Petteri Putaansuu (born 15 February 1974), best known by his stage names Mr Lordi or Mr L, is a Finnish musician, businessman, special effect make-up artist, songwriter, painter, comics artist and graphic designer. He is best known as the lead vocalist of heavy metal/hard rock band Lordi. In the band he is responsible for songwriting and creating all the masks, costumes, graphics and stage props. Mr Lordi has written songs and provided album artwork for bands such as Rotten Sound, Jope Ruonansuu, Domination Black, Grandevils and Agnes Pihlava. He has also had a few art exhibitions in Finland. All publicity photographs of Mr Lordi have his face concealed with his mask and stage makeup. However, many tabloids have published unlicensed photos of his unmasked face. An officially published photograph of his unmasked face was taken in the early 1990s, as the chairman of Kiss Army Finland." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jo-El Sonnier (/ʒoʊˌɛl sɒnˈjeɪ/; born Joel Sonnier; October 2, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter and accordionist who performs country music and Cajun music. Originally signed to Mercury Nashville Records, Sonnier charted several minor singles on the Billboard country charts in the late 1970s. By the late 1980s, he had signed to RCA Records, breaking through with the Top Ten hits \"No More One More Time\" and a cover of Richard Thompson's \"Tear Stained Letter\". Although his chart success waned at the beginning of the 1990s, he has continued recording music, releasing more than thirty albums primarily on independent labels." ;

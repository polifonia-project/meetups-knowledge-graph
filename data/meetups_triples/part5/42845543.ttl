        mtp:hasAbstract        "Angelina Jordan (born Angelina Jordan Astar; 10 January 2006) is a Norwegian singer now living in Los Angeles, whose audition for the 2014 season of Norway's Got Talent, singing \"Gloomy Sunday\" in the style of Billie Holiday, became a viral video online and brought her worldwide press coverage at the age of 8. She went on to win the competition with her performance of George Gershwin's \"Summertime\". Since then she has worked to raise millions of dollars on behalf of environmental causes and children's charities around the world. She always performs barefoot, after befriending a young shoeless girl and giving her shoes to her. Jordan wrote a book about the experience and became the youngest published author in Norway. Jordan has released multiple digital singles, two EPs, and one album called It's Magic. She appeared on the first season of Little Big Shots in 2016, and the second season of America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2020, where her cover version of Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" brought her much attention. In August 2020, it was announced that she has signed with Republic Records. Her first single under that label, \"Million Miles\", was released in November 2020." ;

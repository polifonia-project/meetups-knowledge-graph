        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jean Coulthard, OC OBC (February 10, 1908 â€“ March 9, 2000) was a Canadian composer and music educator. She was one of a trio of women composers who dominated Western Canadian music in the twentieth century: Coulthard, Barbara Pentland, and Violet Archer. All three died within weeks of each other in 2000. Her own work might be loosely termed \"prematurely neo-Romantic\", as the orthodox serialists who dominated academic musical life in North America during the 1950s and 1960s had little use for her. Some of her well-known compositions include Cradle Song, Threnody, Canadian Fantasy, Ballade \"A Winter's Tale\" and her opera Return of the Native." ;

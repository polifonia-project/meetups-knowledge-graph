        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Cloud Berman (born David Craig Berman; January 4, 1967 â€“ August 7, 2019) was an American musician, singer and poet. In 1989, he founded the indie rock band Silver Jews with Pavement's Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, and he was its only constant member until its dissolution in 2009. Berman wrote Silver Jews' lyrics; further, with Malkmus, he developed the simple country-rock sound that characterized their early lo-fi recordings. His abstract and autobiographical lyrics, which he extensively labored over, were his creative priority. His only published volume of poetry, Actual Air, appeared in 1999, by which time heroin and crack cocaine addictions loomed large. His struggle with substance abuse, depression and anxiety overcame his career, and he attempted suicide in 2003. Afterward, he underwent rehabilitation, and engaged with Judaism. Alongside his wife Cassie Berman, he adopted the band name Purple Mountains and released an eponymous debut album that July. Although he had planned a tour to pay off a $100,000 credit card debt, he died by suicide in August 2019. Although Berman believed his work was unappreciated, he cultivated a passionate following and is regarded as a significant and influential indie rock cult figure." ;

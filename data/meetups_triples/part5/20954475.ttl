        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gloria Tang Sze-wing (born 16 August 1991), professionally known as G.E.M. (backronym of Get Everybody Moving) or Tang Tsz-kei (simplified Chinese: 邓紫棋; traditional Chinese: 鄧紫棋; pinyin: Dèng Zǐqí), is a Hong Kong singer-songwriter originally from Shanghai, China. She made her debut in the Hong Kong music industry in 2008. After releasing three albums in Hong Kong, her appearance in the 2014 edition of Chinese singing competition program I Am a Singer and subsequent 2nd-place finish gained her immense fame and popularity in Greater China. In 2015, she released her first full Mandopop album Heartbeat. The following year, she became the only Asian artist featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30. She is the first female Chinese singer to have four music videos that exceed 100 million views on YouTube." ;

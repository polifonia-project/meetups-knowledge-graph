        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joi Lansing (born Joy Rae Brown, April 6, 1929 â€“ August 7, 1972) was an American model, film and television actress, and nightclub singer. She was noted for her pin-up photos and roles in B-movies, as well as a prominent role in the famous opening \"tracking shot\" in Orson Welles' 1958 crime drama Touch of Evil. Lansing was often cast in roles similar to those played by her contemporaries Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren. She frequently was clad in skimpy costumes and bikinis that accentuated her figure (34D bust), but she never posed nude. Publicity reports claimed that Lansing practiced yoga for relaxation and was a devout Mormon." ;

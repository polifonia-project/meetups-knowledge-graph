        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sebastian Zawadzki (born 14 October 1991) is a Polish-born composer and pianist living in Copenhagen who has been releasing albums since 2014 as well as composing and arranging music for a wide array of media including TV and films. In his works he incorporates elements of classical, electronic and jazz music. In April 2018, Zawadzki released a postclassical minimalistic album Norn inspired by an extinct language norn for string quartet, piano and ambient synths. In July 2017, Zawadzki released his third album Between the Dusk of a Summer Night inspired by William Ernest Henley's poetry. It is a neoclassical work performed by Budapest Symphony Orchestra and soloists, combined with electronics and nature sounds. This work integrates musicians across the different music genres." ;

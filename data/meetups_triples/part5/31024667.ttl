He learned to play his first songs from his father, who was an amateur. He is self-taught, and began playing professionally at the age of 15. He has worked with many of the leading Greek singers. During his many collaborations, he concurrently began teaching in 1990. Most of his efforts to date are devoted to the study-research necessary, for the evolution of the bouzoukiâ€™s technique and organized curriculum." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ariyan Arslani (born December 2, 1983), professionally known as Action Bronson, is an American rapper, songwriter, chef, wrestler, exotic olive oil taster, and television presenter. Born and raised in Queens, New York, he embarked on his musical career in January 2011, with the mixtape Bon Appetit ..... Bitch. He independently released his debut album Dr. Lecter, in March 2011. In August 2012, Action signed his first major-label deal with Warner Bros. Records, but was later moved to the Atlantic Records-distributed label Vice Records. Arslani went on to create two self-released mixtapes, Rare Chandeliers (2012) with American music producer, Daniel Alan Maman, better known as The Alchemist, and Blue Chips 2 (2013) with longtime producer Party Supplies, before releasing his major-label debut, an extended play (EP) titled Saaab Stories, with frequent collaborator Harry Fraud, in 2013. He released his major-label debut album, Mr. Wonderful, in March 2015, debuting at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart, receiving over 48,000 streams that week. Aside from his career in music, Arslani hosted The Untitled Action Bronson Show, a talk/variety show, and still hosts his travel program Fuck, That's Delicious, on Viceland. His frequent collaborators and lifelong friends Meyhem Lauren, The Alchemist, and Big Body Bes are regulars on both of his television series. Renowned chefs such as Mario Batali, Andrew Zimmern, Daniel Boulud, Rick Bayless, Grant Achatz, and others have been guests on his television series. In September 2017, Arslani published his first book, based on his travel show, a cookbook, also entitled Fuck, That's Delicious." ;

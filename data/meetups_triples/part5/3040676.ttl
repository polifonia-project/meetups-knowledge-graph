        mtp:hasAbstract        "Waylon Albright \"Shooter\" Jennings (born May 19, 1979) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. He is the only son of country singers Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter. In a career spanning over two decades, Shooter Jennings has explored a variety of genres as part of his eclectic sound, including southern rock, country, hard rock, blues rock, electronica and rock and roll. Jennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album “Put the \"O\" Back in Country” on Universal South, which peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard country charts. Jennings has since followed with six more full-length studio albums: Electric Rodeo (2006), The Wolf (2007), Black Ribbons (2009), Family Man (2012), The Other Life (2013) and Countach (For Giorgio) (2016), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous EPs. In 2018, Jennings released his eighth album, called Shooter, under Dave Cobb’s Low Country Sound imprint label." ;

Born and raised in Wollongong, New South Wales, she began her career in musical theatre. She later pursued an acting career in 1998 with guest appearances in television shows. Bassingthwaighte rose to prominence in 2003 on the Australian soap opera Neighbours for her role as Izzy Hoyland, which earned her three Logie Award nominations. In 2004, she was recruited as the lead singer of Australian electro-pop band, Rogue Traders. After leaving Neighbours in 2006 to focus on her music career, Bassingthwaighte released a cover of \"Don't Give Up\" with Shannon Noll, which peaked at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum. In 2008, she left Rogue Traders to pursue her solo music career. Bassingthwaighte released her debut solo album 1000 Stars in 2009, which spawned the platinum top-ten hits \"Alive\" and \"Someday Soon\". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold. After seven years away from the Rogue Traders, Bassingthwaighte returned as the band's lead singer in 2015. Aside from her acting and music career, Bassingthwaighte co-wrote her first book, Sistahood: A Journal of Self-Discovery, with her younger sister in 2008. That same year, she made her debut as a television presenter, hosting So You Think You Can Dance Australia for its first three seasons, which earned her another three Logie Award nominations. From 2011 to 2014, she was a judge and mentor on The X Factor Australia, and briefly joined The X Factor New Zealand in 2015. That same year, Bassingthwaighte launched her own children's clothing label, Chi Khi.

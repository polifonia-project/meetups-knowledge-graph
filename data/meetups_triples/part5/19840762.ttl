His research, writing and presentations primarily analyze the structure of 15th century Latin Christian motets, which are a category of choral musical compositions.Drake is notable for his research and papers that vehemently challenge commonly held views regarding the complex and often misunderstood relationship between words and music in motets of the late 15th century, as well as his discoveries related to the origins of the Buonaparte (not Napoleon) family. He also served on the editorial advisory board for \"The Quad\" Magazine." ;

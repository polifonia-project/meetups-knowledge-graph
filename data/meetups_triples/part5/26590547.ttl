        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald K. Keys Jr. aka DJ Swamp is an American hip hop DJ, turntablist, producer and vocalist. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. He currently resides in Los Angeles, United States. In 1996, he won the title of US DMC Champion, his first year entering the tournament. Swamp toured with Beck for four years and later broke away into a solo career with his release \"Never is Now\" in 2001. Alternative Press gave \"Never is Now\" an 8/10 rating. His follow-up, a drum 'n' bass EP, Instruments of Torture, was recorded with Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto. Vinyl Disciple produced several music videos, including four 3D music videos. The music video for \"The Leaders will Follow\" is the first music video to incorporate 3D video scratching. His music video for \"Rock Rollin'\" features Dave England of Jackass fame. DJ Swamp has produced several DJ tools that are considered standards, including \"skip-proof\" records, which have the same sample repeated over and over so that if the needle is bumped it will land in the same sample. DJ Swamp's scratch at the beginning of The Crystal Method track \"Name of the Game\" is one of his most recognizable scratches. The song is featured in several films, including Tropic Thunder. DJ Swamp released a new single in 2021 \"Wearin' My Mask\"" ;

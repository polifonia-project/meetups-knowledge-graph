        mtp:hasAbstract        "Leslie Edward Claypool (born September 29, 1963) is an American musician, best known as the founder, lead singer, bassist, primary songwriter, and only continuous member of the rock band Primus. Frequently considered one of the best bass players of all time, his playing style is well known for mixing tapping, flamenco-like strumming, whammy bar bends, and slapping. Outside of Primus, Claypool has also been involved in a number of side projects, including the supergroups Oysterhead alongside Trey Anastasio (Phish) and Stewart Copeland (The Police), and Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains (C2B3), alongside Buckethead, Bryan Mantia (Primus) and Bernie Worrell (P-Funk). He also fronted the experimental rock projects Frog Brigade and Fancy Band. He has also self-produced and engineered several solo releases from his own studio, Rancho Relaxo. In 2006, a full-length feature film, Electric Apricot, written and directed by Claypool, was released, as well as his debut novel South of the Pumphouse. Most recently, he has been involved in several duos, including Duo de Twang with Brian Kehoe (M.I.R.V.), and The Claypool Lennon Delirium with Sean Lennon (The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger)." ;

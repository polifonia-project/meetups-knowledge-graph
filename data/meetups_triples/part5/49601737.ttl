He has been writing and recording songs since age 13, and has accumulated a catalogue of over 200 tracks. In 2009, Bostock graduated from Cooper Union in New York City with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. There he entered a work-study relationship with music producer Jorge Elbrecht, known for his work in Lansing-Dreiden and Ariel Pink. This relationship has been credited as being a key point in the artist's development. On August 7, 2015 Arbutus Records issued a compilation of Michael Stasis titled \"RIP III\"." ;

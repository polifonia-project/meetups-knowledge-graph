        mtp:hasAbstract        "Suwa Nejiko (諏訪根自子) (23 January 1920 – 6 March 2012) was a Japanese violinist who earned fame as a child prodigy during the inter-war period. In early Shōwa Japan she was dubbed \"The Girl Genius with the Beautiful Face\" (美貌の天才少女, Bibō no tensai shōjo). Although her career was mostly confined to Japan and Europe, she posthumously became the source of controversy in the United States concerning the gift of what was claimed to be a Stradivarius violin by Joseph Goebbels, which possibly had been confiscated from its previous Jewish owner." ;

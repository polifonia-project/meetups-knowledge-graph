        mtp:hasAbstract        "George \"Porky\" Peckham (born 1942, Blackburn, Lancashire) is an English record engineer, widely recognised as among the most accomplished in the business. He has been responsible for producing the master discs from which many vinyl records have been pressed over the last 40 years. His master discs, and the records that were produced from them, often bear either the motto \"A Porky Prime Cut\" or a cryptic or a humorous comment, etched onto the run-out grooves in his handwriting. Other inscriptions attributed to him include \"Pecko\" and \"Pecko Duck\". One of his most technically demanding achievements was the so-called \"three-sided\" album, The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief (1973), mastered with two concentric grooves on side two, so that different material would be played depending on where the stylus was put down on the record's surface." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rogério Tolomei Teixeira (born September 2, 1956), better known by his stage name Rogério Skylab, is a Brazilian singer-songwriter, lyricist, classical guitarist, poet, essayist, record producer, actor and former television presenter. His unique musical style is characterized by minimalism and eclecticism, and his lyrics are permeated by acerbic allusions to popular culture, pessimism, scatology, nihilism and black comedy (he has, however, always denied that his songs have humorous purposes). Some of his most recognizable compositions are \"Motosserra\", \"Fátima Bernardes Experiência\", \"Dedo, Língua, Cu e Boceta\", \"Eu Chupo o Meu Pau\", \"Matador de Passarinho\" and \"Chico Xavier & Roberto Carlos\"." ;

Coleman came on the scene replacing Tisha Campbell in the longest running Off-Broadway musical production of Mama, I Want to Sing!, in 1983. Coleman discovered her ability to sing at the age of six. Desiree's mother on hearing her daughter's voice encouraged her to join the St. Luke Baptist Church choir in Queens, New York. During her growing years, she did several commercials and by age fourteen became a part of a community choir called the Soul Searchers of New York City. In 2006, Coleman recorded a song with WWE called, \"Holla\", which later became the entrance music for WWE Diva, Kelly Kelly." ;

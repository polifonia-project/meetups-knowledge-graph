He wrote the lyrics to the standards \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" (with Jay Gorney), \"April in Paris\", and \"It's Only a Paper Moon\", as well as all of the songs for the film The Wizard of Oz, including \"Over the Rainbow\". He was known for the social commentary of his lyrics, as well as his leftist leanings. He championed racial and gender equality and union politics. He also was an ardent critic of religion." ;

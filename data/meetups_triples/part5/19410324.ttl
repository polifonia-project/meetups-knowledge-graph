He is regarded as \"famous across the country\" for teaching children how to play the tin whistle. He is also noted as a supporter of the Donegal county football team, and plays his pipes on match-days, hence the name of Donegal Piper. Until the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the sport, Murray had not missed a competitive Donegal game since the 1990s." ;

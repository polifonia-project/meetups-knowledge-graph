He has written concert pieces as well as music for dance, theatre, and video – many of them performed worldwide; he is also an active player at the free improvisation scene around Europe and the United Kingdom. Founder and director of the ‘Cardboard Citizens New Music Ensemble’, the UK’s only professional avant-garde music group whose members are all homeless people, refugees and asylum seekers; writing, directing and performing contemporary and improvisatory music with mixed ensembles of professional and non-professional musicians is one of his main fields of expertise (a skill he acknowledges he learned working with his former teacher Daryl Runswick). Other activities include performing with electroacoustic trio '' and with the algorithmic junkestra '’. He has collaborated with various artists, including: Luis 'Toto' Alvarez, Darío Bernal Villegas, Luke Fraser, Leonel Kaplan, , , and Nikos Veliotis, (free improvisation), Melanie Clarke, , Carla Onni, Zoi Dimitriou, Antigone Avdi and Danai Pappa (dance), Adrian Jackson (Cardboard Citizens) (theatre) and Mario Lewis (video)." ;

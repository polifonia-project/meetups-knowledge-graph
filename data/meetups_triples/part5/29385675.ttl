        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dan Sane (possibly September 22, 1896 â€“ February 18, 1956) was an American Memphis blues and country blues guitarist and songwriter. He was an associate of Frank Stokes. According to the Music journalist Jason Ankeny, \"they had emerged among the most complementary duos in all of the blues, with Sane's flatpicking ideally embellished by Stokes' fluid rhythms.\" The best-known of the songs written by Sane are \"Downtown Blues\" and \"Mr. Crump Don't Like It.\" His surname was sometimes spelled \"Sain\"." ;

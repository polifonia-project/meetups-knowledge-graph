        mtp:hasAbstract        "Max Richter (/ˈrɪxtər/; German: [ˈʁɪçtɐ]; born 22 March 1966) is a British composer and pianist. He works within postminimalism and in the meeting of contemporary classical and alternative popular musical styles. Richter is classically trained, having graduated in composition from the University of Edinburgh, the Royal Academy of Music in London, and studied with Luciano Berio in Italy. Richter arranges, performs, and composes music for stage, opera, ballet and screen. He has collaborated with other musicians, as well as with performance, installation and media artists. He has recorded eight solo albums, and his music is widely used in cinema, such as the score of Ari Folman's animated war film Waltz with Bashir (2008). As of December 2019, Richter has passed one billion streams and one million album sales." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stephen Barry Singleton (born 17 April 1959) is an English musician, currently residing in Sheffield, England. He was the saxophonist in the pop band ABC (which he left in 1984), starring in the 1983 short film Mantrap. According to an interview Singleton did for the documentary Made in Sheffield, he was friends with Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott when the two were young children. Along with Mark White and David Sydenham, he founded the band Vice Versa in 1977. He also produced several issues of Steve's Papers, a Sheffield punk fanzine. In the early 1990s, Singleton was a member of the band Bleep & Booster, who released an album on London Records and produced some remixes for East 17. Singleton also produced records by the Treebound Story (featuring a young Richard Hawley) and Libitina. Singleton declined to participate in VH1's Bands Reunited in 2004, when attempts were made to reform ABC for a one-off performance. Only two members, Martin Fry and David Palmer, reunited and performed. In 2015, Stephen Singleton and Mark White reformed Vice Versa." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard James Edwards (born 22 December 1967 â€“ disappeared 1 February 1995), also known as Richey James or Richey Manic, was a Welsh musician who was the lyricist and rhythm guitarist of the alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. He was known for his dark, politicised and intellectual songwriting which, combined with an enigmatic and eloquent character, has assured him cult status. He has been cited as a leading lyricist of his generation, leading the Cool Cymru. Edwards disappeared on 1 February 1995. On 24 November 2008, he was declared presumed dead \"on or since\" 1 February 1995. The ninth Manic Street Preachers album, Journal for Plague Lovers, released on 18 May 2009, is composed entirely of songs with lyrics left by Edwards. As of 2005, the remaining members of Manic Street Preachers were still paying 25% royalties into an account in his name." ;

He replaced Stuart Zender in 1999 with the release of the album Synkronized. He was in the process of applying to a Jamiroquai tribute band when he got the offer to join Jamiroquai. Fyffe recorded and toured with the band until his departure in 2003. Since his departure from Jamiroquai, Fyffe has been lecturing at various colleges and playing with the English electronic group The Shapeshifters as well as blues rock band The Temperance Movement, whose self-titled first album was released on 16 September 2013. Subsequent albums with The Temperance Movement include White Bear (2016) and A Deeper Cut (2018). Fyffe regularly takes part in 'The Sunflower Jam', an annual live music event intended to raise money to provide alternative medicine in National Health Service hospitals. Since the first event in 2006, he has played alongside Robert Plant, Deep Purple, Status Quo, and Bruce Dickinson . He is an alumnus from Chichester College.

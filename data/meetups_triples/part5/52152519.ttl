On his few recordings, released from 1929 to 1937, he was accompanied by Roosevelt Sykes, Lonnie Johnson, Pinetop Sparks and others. His most notable song was one he wrote, \"Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)\", which he recorded in Grafton, Wisconsin, about February 1930. There is little information about his life outside of his recordings." ;

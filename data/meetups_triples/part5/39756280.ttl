        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rick Bogart is a jazz musician. Early in his career he played clarinet and piano, but he eventually focused solely on clarinet and later added vocals. He also composed throughout his career for clarinet. Rick Bogart worked in New Orleans during the \"heyday\" of the French Quarter during the mid 1970s within the first five blocks of Bourbon Street. At that time, there were fifteen full-time Jazz bands along those blocks. During this time he played in the bands of Snookum Russell and Wallace Davenport at the Paddock Lounge, and with June Gardner, Nick Gagliardi, Milton Ziedrich and Thomas Jefferson at the Famous Door. Bogart later moved to New York City to refine and broaden his style. He played in Atlantic City, Cleveland, New York City, Miami, and touring the world headlining on cruise ships for decades. He has written songs for major movies produced for HBO and is the subject of the documentary When the Clarinet Swings. He is most closely aligned with his New Orleans and Swing-style background. However, he has broadened his style over the course of his career by living and working in New York, and working with many musicians of varying styles around the world." ;

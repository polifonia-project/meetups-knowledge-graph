        mtp:hasAbstract        "Craig Morgan Greer (born July 17, 1964) is an American country music artist. A veteran of the United States Army as a forward observer, Morgan began his musical career in 2000 on Atlantic Records, releasing his self-titled debut album for that label before the closure of its Nashville division in 2000. In 2002, Morgan signed to the independent Broken Bow Records, on which he released three studio albums: 2003's I Love It, 2005's My Kind of Livin', and 2006's Little Bit of Life. These produced several chart hits, including \"That's What I Love About Sunday\", which spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard country charts while also holding the No. 1 position on that year's Billboard Year-End chart for the country format. A greatest hits package followed in mid-2008 before Morgan signed to BNA Records and released That's Why later that same year. After exiting BNA, Morgan signed with Black River Entertainment and released This Ole Boy in 2012, followed by A Whole Lot More to Me in 2016. Morgan has charted seventeen times on the Billboard country charts. Besides \"That's What I Love About Sunday\", six more of his singles have reached that chart's top ten: \"Almost Home\", \"Redneck Yacht Club\", \"Little Bit of Life\", \"International Harvester\", \"Love Remembers\", and \"Bonfire\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Östen Warnerbring (22 November 1934 – 18 January 2006), also known as Östen med Rösten (lit. \"Östen with the Voice\"), was a Swedish singer, musician, composer and lyrics writer who mastered several musical genres. He started out as a jazz musician but over the years, he became known as a singer of other popular music, such as schlager music, and of Swedish poetry put into music by himself. In the 1970s, he became one of the first Swedish artists to use his native accent, of the province of Scania (Skåne) in the south of Sweden, also while singing." ;

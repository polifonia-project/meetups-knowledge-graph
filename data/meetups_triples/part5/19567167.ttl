Raised in Michigan, Wilkes-Krier began his musical career in the mid-1990s. He performed in a number of local bands before eventually moving to New York, where he produced his first recordings under the Andrew W.K. moniker. After gaining initial attention with the 2000 EP Girls Own Juice, Wilkes-Krier rose to prominence with the release of his debut studio album I Get Wet in November 2001. In the years following its release, Wilkes-Krier has undertaken a number of other musical and non-musical ventures including television and radio work, motivational speaking, and writing." ;

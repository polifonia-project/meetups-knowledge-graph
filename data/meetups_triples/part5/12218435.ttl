        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kenneth Greene (born August 12, 1984), better known by his stage name Doap Nixon, is an American hip hop artist and rapper who is a former member of supergroup Army of the Pharaohs. He has collaborated with a variety of underground hip hop artists and released his debut full solo album, Sour Diesel in 2008. In 2009, it was announced that Army of the Pharaohs was working on their third studio album, titled The Unholy Terror. It was confirmed that Doap Nixon was to make a comeback in the group and featured on the album. The official street release date was March 30, 2010, but the album was released early on March 19, 2010, on UGHH.com. In late 2010, Doap stepped forward with his second album, Gray Poupon. It was known for Doap asserting his voice and perspective, outside of his lyrical cartel. Shortly after the release of Gray Poupon, Doap announced that he was working on his third studio album, titled Doap Traffiking: The Rise And Fall Of Darth Nixon. The album was officially released on November 17, 2011. Doap Nixon was also on the fourth Army of the Pharaohs album In Death Reborn. New members including Blacastan of The Demigodz and Zilla from Houston, Texas were said to be joining the group. His final appearance for the supergroup was on the album Heavy Lies the Crown. He released his fourth studio album Sour Diesel II in 2019." ;

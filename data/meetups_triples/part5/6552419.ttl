        mtp:hasAbstract        "Camille Yarbrough (born January 8, 1938) is an American musician, dancer, actress, poet, activist, television producer, and author. She is best known for the song \"Take Yo' Praise\", which Fatboy Slim sampled in his 1998 track \"Praise You\". \"Take Yo' Praise\" was originally recorded in 1975 for Yarbrough's first album, The Iron Pot Cooker, released on Vanguard Records. Yarbrough stated that the song was written for \"all the people who had come through the black civil rights movement, who had stood up for truth and righteousness and justice, because human beings need to praise and respect one another more than they do\". The Iron Pot Cooker was based on the 1971 stage dramatization of Yarbrough's one-woman, spoken word show, Tales and Tunes of an African American Griot. She toured nationally with this show during the 1970s and 1980s. Yarbrough's second album, Ancestor House, is a spoken word/soul/blues album that she released on her own record label, Maat Music, in 2003. Ancestor House was recorded live at Joe's Pub in New York City." ;

During the 1960s, she played small television roles before appearing in films and was regularly featured in fashion magazines as a model and cover girl. After receiving positive reviews for her comedic and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers. She made her film debut in 1961 as an extra in Barabbas with Anthony Quinn. She next appeared in the horror film Eye of the Devil (1966). Her most remembered performance was as Jennifer North in the 1967 cult classic film Valley of the Dolls, which earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. That year, she also performed in the film The Fearless Vampire Killers, directed by her future husband Roman Polanski. Tate's last completed film, 12+1, was released posthumously in 1969. On August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were murdered by members of the Manson Family, a cult, in the home she shared with Polanski. She was eight-and-a-half months pregnant." ;

A graduate of the University of Maryland (1959), Scotti played for the Washington Redskins (1959–1961), the Philadelphia Eagles (1962–1963), and the San Francisco 49ers (1964). In late November 1963, Scotti received brief national attention when he precipitated a fight with teammate John Mellekas that sent Mellekas to the hospital. He is the brother of media mogul Tony Scotti, with whom he co-produced a few television programs, most notably the lifeguard drama Baywatch, and also co-founded the Scotti Bros. record label which released music by artists such as Leif Garrett, Survivor and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic until the label was dissolved in the mid-1990s. He went on to form Banders." ;

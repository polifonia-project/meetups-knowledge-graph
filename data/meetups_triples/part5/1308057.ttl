        mtp:hasAbstract        "Viktor Robertovich Tsoi (Russian: Виктор Робертович Цой; Russian pronunciation: [ˈvʲikt̪ər ˈrobʲɪrt̪əvʲɪtɕ ˈtsoi̯]; 21 June 1962 – 15 August 1990) was a Soviet singer and songwriter who co-founded Kino, one of the most popular and musically influential bands in the history of Russian-language music. Born and raised in Leningrad (now known as Saint Petersburg), Tsoi started writing songs as a teenager. Throughout his career, Tsoi contributed a plethora of musical and artistic works, including ten albums. After Kino appeared and performed in the 1987 Soviet film Assa, the band's popularity surged, triggering a period referred to as \"Kinomania\", and leading to Tsoi's leading role in the 1988 Kazakh new wave art film The Needle. In 1990, after their high-profile concert at the Luzhniki Stadium, Tsoi briefly relocated to Latvia with bandmate Yuri Kasparyan to work on the band's next album. Two months after the concert, Tsoi died in a car collision. He is regarded as one of the most important pioneers of Russian/Soviet rock and is credited with popularizing the genre throughout the Soviet Union. He retains a devoted following in many ex-Soviet countries, such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, where he is known as one of the most influential and popular people in the history of Russian music. Viktor Tsoi became popular by combining his music and lyrics with philosophy." ;

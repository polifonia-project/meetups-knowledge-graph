        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martin Luther \"ML\" Procise III (June 21, 1952 â€“ March 5, 2015) was an American audio engineer who mixed more than 4,500 concerts for a wide array of musical artists including the Bee Gees, Michael Jackson/the Jackson 5, and ZZ Top. Procise started his live sound mixing career in 1975 with Showco, his first assignment mixing monitors for Genesis. He continued mixing concerts throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and he increasingly took on a role in company management and sales, becoming the Senior Director of Touring, and the Vice President of Sales. In 2000 when Clair Brothers bought Showco, Procise was named Executive Director of Touring. In 2014 he was inducted into the Tour Link Top Dog Hall of Fame." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark Andrew \"Barney\" Greenway (born 13 July 1969) is a British extreme metal vocalist who is the current lead singer of Napalm Death and a former member of Extreme Noise Terror and Benediction. Greenway has stated his nickname \"Barney\" came from a time when he used to drink alcohol. He stated he would get so drunk that when he went anywhere, he would bump into everything. From this behaviour, his friend Stick (drummer of Doom) would call him \"Rubble\", which changed to \"Barney Rubble\" and then just \"Barney\"." ;

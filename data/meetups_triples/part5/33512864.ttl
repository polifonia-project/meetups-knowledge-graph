        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Alan Hunter (1 October 1975 â€“ 20 October 2011), better known as Hunter or Huntz, was an Australian rapper and hip hop artist. He was a founder of Perth's hip hop scene in the 1990s and a member of the MC collective Syllabolix (SBX) Crew. During his career, he released four albums: Done DL (2002), Going Back to Yokine (2006), Monster House (2010) and Fear and Loathing (2011). Hunter died of neuroendocrine cancer in 2011 at the age of 36. He was post-humously inducted into the Western Australian Music Industry Awards Hall of Fame and was the subject of a documentary titled Hunter: For the Record which recorded the final years of his life. The anniversary of his death was commemorated by an \"AUS All Star\" gig and an inaugural Australian rules match, named the Robert Hunter Cup in his honour, both events which brought together members of the hip hop community from across Australia." ;

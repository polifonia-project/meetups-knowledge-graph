        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian Michael Firkus (born August 23, 1989), better known by the stage name Trixie Mattel, is an American drag queen, television personality, and singer-songwriter originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She is known for her exaggerated, high-camp style and blend of comedy and acoustic pop. After initially competing on the seventh season of the drag competition RuPaul's Drag Race in 2015, she would later go on to win the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2018. Mattel stars in the World of Wonder web series UNHhhh (2016–present), its Viceland spin-off The Trixie & Katya Show (2017–2018), and the Netflix web series I Like to Watch (2019–present), alongside fellow drag queen and frequent collaborator Katya Zamolodchikova with whom she forms the popular comedy duo known as Trixie and Katya. Her music style is primarily folk and country, with her first and second studio albums Two Birds (2017) and One Stone (2018) both charting on the Billboard Folk Albums chart at number sixteen. Her third studio album Barbara (2020) featured an \"electro-folk\" sound and her first EP Full Coverage, Vol. 1 (2021) consists of Mattel's covers of various songs. Her comedy special, Trixie Mattel: One Night Only (2020) was nominated for a Critics' Choice Television Award. She appeared as a judge on the competition series Queen of the Universe (2021–present). She also stars in and produces Trixie Motel, a limited docuseries where she and her boyfriend, David Silver, renovate a rundown motel in Palm Springs, California (2022). Along with Katya, Mattel published her first book, Trixie and Katya's Guide to Modern Womanhood (2020), which became a New York Times bestseller. She has appeared on New York Magazine's list of \"The Most Powerful Drag Queens in America\", ranking fourth. She also operates a YouTube channel focused on beauty and music, with frequent collaborations with fellow drag queens, and celebrities such as Iggy Azalea, Nicole Byer, and Margaret Cho. Her business ventures include being the founder and CEO of Trixie Cosmetics, a cosmetics brand that launched in 2019. Mattel's persona is inspired by her love of Barbie dolls: she owns a large collection of Barbies that she has shared in videos on her YouTube channel." ;

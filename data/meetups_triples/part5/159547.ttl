        mtp:hasAbstract        "Milica Bogdanovna Jovovich (/ˈjoʊvəvɪtʃ/ YOH-və-vitch; born December 17, 1975), known professionally as Milla Jovovich, is an American actress and model. Her starring roles in numerous science-fiction and action films led the music channel VH1 to deem her the \"reigning queen of kick-butt\" in 2006. In 2004, Forbes determined that she was the highest-paid model in the world. Born in Kiev (now Kyiv) and raised in Los Angeles, Jovovich began modeling when Herb Ritts photographed her for the cover of the Italian magazine Lei in 1987. Richard Avedon featured her in Revlon's \"Most Unforgettable Women in the World\" advertisements. In 1988, Jovovich made her screen debut in the television film The Night Train to Kathmandu and appeared in her first feature film, Two Moon Junction. Jovovich gained attention for her role in the 1991 romance film Return to the Blue Lagoon, as she was 15 years old at the time. She was considered to have a breakthrough with her role in the 1997 French science-fiction action film The Fifth Element, written and directed by Luc Besson. She and Besson married that year, but soon divorced. She starred as the heroine and martyr in Besson's The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999). From 2002 to 2016, Jovovich portrayed Alice in the action horror film franchise Resident Evil, which became the highest-grossing film series to be based on video games. Jovovich released a debut album, The Divine Comedy, in 1994, and a follow-up, The People Tree Sessions, in 1998. She continues to release demos for other songs on her official website and frequently contributes to film soundtracks. In 2003, model Carmen Hawk and she created the clothing line Jovovich–Hawk, which ran until 2008. Jovovich has her own production company, Creature Entertainment." ;

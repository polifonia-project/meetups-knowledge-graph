        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Valentine Carruthers (born 1958 in Wortley, West Riding of Yorkshire) is an English musician, guitarist, and composer. He is mainly known for being a member of Siouxsie and the Banshees from mid-1984 until early 1987. In the early 1980s, he joined Sheffield band Clock DVA after the release of their second studio album. His first recording with Clock DVA was the EP Passions Still Aflame in 1982. It was followed by the album Advantage in 1983. He was then recruited by Siouxsie and the Banshees to be a full-time member of the group from May 1984. With the Banshees, he recorded The Thorn EP (1984), and two studio albums Tinderbox in 1986, and the covers album Through the Looking Glass in 1987. He left the band in January 1987. Carruthers teamed up with his friend drummer Paul Ferguson to form the band Crush with American musicians. They released a self-titled album in 1993. That year, he also played guitars on Lloyd Cole's third solo album Bad Vibes, and also took part in the album Wishing Well by Californian band Ten Wings. In 2007, while in New York, he co-composed several songs with Kim Fahy's group the Mabuses on their album Mabused!." ;

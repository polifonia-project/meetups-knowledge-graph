He started composing after quitting medical school, and became a solo artist releasing his first album, Je n'aurai pas le temps, in 1967. The title track was later recorded in English by John Rowles as \"If I Only Had Time\". He formed a troupe of singers and dancers named Le Big Bazar in 1972, and had some successes including the hit song \"Une belle histoire\", and was involved in projects including the soundtrack for the film Un jour, la fête. He also had successes as a solo act, toured extensively and made regular appearances in radio and television shows dedicated to chanson and popular music between 1988 and 2002. His career went into a hiatus after the death of his daughter, but he resumed his career in 2005, and launched the project Pluribus in 2013." ;

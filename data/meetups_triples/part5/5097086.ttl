        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hironobu Kageyama (影山 ヒロノブ, Kageyama Hironobu, real name written 景山 浩宣, born February 18, 1961) is a Japanese singer and composer prominent in the soundtracks for anime, video game and tokusatsu productions. He is sometimes called Kami (Kei) by his fans. Kageyama got his big break at age 16, as lead singer of the rock band Lazy. By the early '80s, the band split and Kageyama went solo. He found major success once he started to sing the theme songs of anime and tokusatsu shows. Becoming immensely popular soon after, Kageyama went on to be dubbed the \"Prince of Anime/Tokusatsu Songs\" and is a main fixture for shows to this day. Kageyama gained notoriety for his opening songs of Dengeki Sentai Changeman, Hikari Sentai Maskman, Chōjin Sentai Jetman, and Dragon Ball Z. He is the original member and current leader of the anisong band JAM Project. Along with Masaaki Endoh, Kageyama hosted Anipara Ongakukan, a TV show aired on the Kids Station Channel that showed live performances of the theme songs of recent anime and tokusatsu shows. The show was canceled in 2017. Kageyama is also the voice of Zaruba, a mystical talking ring, as well as the loyal ally and advisor to the titular hero of the tokusatsu franchise Garo, for which JAM Project has performed the opening themes." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Olga Alexandrovna Peretyatko (Russian: Ольга Александровна Перетятько; born 21 May 1980) is a Russian operatic soprano. She has been known for lyric and coloratura soprano roles, most notably in operas by Rossini and Mozart. In recent years, she has been taking up heavier and more lyrical roles. She embarked her professional career in Hamburg State Opera's Young Artists' Program and at the Rossini Opera Festival with her collaboration with Alberto Zedda. Following winning second prize in Plácido Domingo's Operalia in 2007, she made her Parisian debut at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. She was noticed internationally after performing the title role in Stravinsky's The Nightingale in 2009. She has been performing on leading stages since; she made her Vienna State Opera debut in 2013, and Metropolitan Opera debut in 2014." ;

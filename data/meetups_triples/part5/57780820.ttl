He represented Norway at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with the song \"Fallen Angel\". He has Tourette syndrome, a condition characterised by involuntary movements called tics. During his childhood, he was bullied for his condition and he was called \"Tics\", which he later turned into his stage name. Besides being a musician, Andreas is a mental health awareness advocate and has shared his experiences with Tourette syndrome, as well as loneliness and suicidal thoughts. In 2019, Andreas was a part of Norwegian Paradise Hotel, season 11, checking in as a VIP contestant. After his long run that season, he was part of the jury deciding the winners." ;

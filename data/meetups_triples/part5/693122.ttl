        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tony Joe White (July 23, 1943 â€“ October 24, 2018), nicknamed the Swamp Fox, was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for his 1969 hit \"Polk Salad Annie\" and for \"Rainy Night in Georgia\", which he wrote but which was first made popular by Brook Benton in 1970. He also wrote \"Steamy Windows\" and \"Undercover Agent for the Blues\", both hits for Tina Turner in 1989; those two songs came by way of Turner's producer at the time, Mark Knopfler, who was a friend of White. \"Polk Salad Annie\" was also recorded by Joe Dassin, Elvis Presley, and Tom Jones." ;

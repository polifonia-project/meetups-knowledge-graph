        mtp:hasAbstract        "Adolphus Bell (June 5, 1944 â€“ October 28, 2013) was an American electric blues musician, best known as a one-man band. He performed in a professional capacity for five decades and released two albums on the Music Maker label. He also played at various music festivals. The music reviewer, Jim DeKoster, writing in Living Blues magazine, noted that \"Adolphus Bell's music stands so well on its own merits that the CD listener soon forgets that he's listening to a one-man band. He's got the same sort of idiosyncratic appeal as Juke Boy Bonner or Guitar Gabriel\"." ;

Villamizar came to prominence as the lead member of the band Bacilos. Bacilos released their album Madera in 1999, and in 2000 they recorded their first album with Warner Music, which was nominated for a Latin Grammy award for Best New Artist. Caraluna (2002) was released and won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album, and Villamizar was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Tropical Song for the second single \"Mi Primer Millón\". The album Sin Vergüenza won a Latin Grammy and the track \"Pasos de Gigante\" became the band's only top ten single in the Billboard Top Latin Songs, which peaked at number eight.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alex or Aleck Miller (originally Ford, possibly December 5, 1912 â€“ May 24, 1965), known later in his career as Sonny Boy Williamson, was an American blues harmonica player, singer and songwriter. He was an early and influential blues harp stylist who recorded successfully in the 1950s and 1960s. Miller used various names, including Rice Miller and Little Boy Blue, before calling himself Sonny Boy Williamson, which was also the name of a popular Chicago blues singer and harmonica player. To distinguish the two, Miller has been referred to as Sonny Boy Williamson II. He first recorded with Elmore James on \"Dust My Broom\". Some of his popular songs include \"Don't Start Me Talkin'\", \"Help Me\", \"Checkin' Up on My Baby\", and \"Bring It On Home\". He toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival and recorded with English rock musicians, including the Yardbirds, the Animals. \"Help Me\" became a blues standard, and many blues and rock artists have recorded his songs." ;

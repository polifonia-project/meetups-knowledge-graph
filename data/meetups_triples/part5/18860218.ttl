        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chris Minh Doky (born 7 February 1969) is a Vietnamese-Danish jazz bassist. He is the younger brother of jazz pianist Niels Lan Doky. He released his first album, Appreciation, in 1989 four years after picking up the instrument. As a sideman, he has collaborated with Mike Stern, Michael Brecker, Trilok Gurtu, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and David Sanborn. His sound is often described as a blend of his native Scandinavian tradition with the feel of his adopted homeland, the United States. His wife Tanja is a lady-in-waiting to Denmark's Crown Princess Mary." ;

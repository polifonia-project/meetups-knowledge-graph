        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Albert Tindley (July 7, 1851 â€“ July 26, 1933) was an American Methodist minister and gospel music composer. His composition \"I'll Overcome Someday\" is credited as the basis for the U.S. Civil Rights anthem \"We Shall Overcome\". Another of his hymns is \"(Take Your Burden to the Lord and) Leave It There\" (1916), as well as \"What Are They Doing in Heaven?\" (1901). Often referred to as \"The Prince of Preachers\", he educated himself, became a minister and founded one of the largest Methodist congregations serving the African-American community on the East Coast of the United States." ;

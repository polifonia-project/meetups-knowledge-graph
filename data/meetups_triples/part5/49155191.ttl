        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sofia Moshevich (Hebrew: סופיה מושביץ'; born 1949) is a Ukrainian-born pianist, teacher and researcher who lived in Moscow, Jerusalem and Johannesburg before emigrating to Canada where she now lives in Toronto. Since the early 1970s, she has taken a special interest in the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, making a careful analysis of his recorded performances as a pianist. Two books document the results of her work: Dmitri Shostakovich, Pianist and Shostakovich's Music for Piano Solo, Interpretation and Performance. She also contributed a chapter on piano music to A Shostakovich Companion, edited by Michael Mishra." ;

He is the lead singer of Indonesian band Noah, formerly known as Peterpan. Ariel founded Peterpan in Bandung in 2000 with Andika, Indra, Lukman, Reza, and Uki. Peterpan's second album Bintang di Surga (2004) is one of the best-selling albums of all time in Indonesia. He was arrested in 2010 on charges relating to celebrity sex tapes found circulating on the internet after his laptop was stolen. Peterpan changed their name to Noah after Ariel's release in 2012. Noah also received commercial success, with their first album Seperti Seharusnya (2012) having sold over one million copies." ;

She was one of the co-founders of the University of Oregon’s female a cappella group, Divisi, with which she sang for five years. Her name is the first word in the first chapter of the book Pitch Perfect, on which the movie of the same title is based. Her and Divisi’s adventures at the 2005 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella Finals make up a major portion of the book. She is married to Peter Hollens and they have two sons, Ashland James Hollens born in 2014 and Saylor James Hollens born in 2018." ;

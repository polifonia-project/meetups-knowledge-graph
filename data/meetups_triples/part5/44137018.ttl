        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gertrude Lightstone Mittelmann, also Gertrude Mittelmann, and Mrs. Jesse Mittelmann (8 February 1907 – 25 October 1956, New York City), was an American concert pianist. The daughter of a well-known New York surgeon, Dr. Abraham (Albert) Lightstone (1874–1955), she was one of the first women radio show hosts, notably at WQXR-AM 1550 KC (Interstate Broadcasting Company). She gave one of her first American concerts at Haddon Hall in 1928. Vinyl and metal record albums were recorded of her performances as a symphonic concert pianist for various orchestras and recitals as a solo artist. In addition, many of her broadcasts as a radio host were recorded on record albums. She participated in numerous cultural and community activities." ;

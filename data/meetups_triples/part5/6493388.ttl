        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frazier Othel Thompson III (born July 3, 1980), better known by his stage name Trae tha Truth (or simply Trae), is an American rapper and record executive from Houston, Texas. Embarking on a musical career in 1998, he soon established himself as a prominent member of the Texas hip hop scene with his solo debut, Losing Composure (2003). Same Thing Different Day (2004) and Restless (2006) followed up, the latter of which was his debut on Rap-a-Lot Records. In total, Trae has released 11 solo studio albums, as well as 26 mixtapes and two albums as a part of the duo Assholes by Nature (ABN) with longtime friend and frequent collaborator Z-Ro. Trae is also known for his I'm On series of singles, which have featured a number of prominent artists since the first installment in 2011. He is currently signed to fellow southern hip hop artist T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records, where he was appointed the title of vice president (VP) in 2017. In addition to his music career, Thompson is known for his activism and philanthropy as the founder of both Angel by Nature, a charity aimed at helping the impoverished youth of Texas, and Relief Gang, a non-profit organisation initially formed to help the people of Houston and the surrounding areas rebuild their homes, as well as provide shelter, food and education in the wake of 2017's Hurricane Harvey. Since forming, the group have expanded to provide aid to people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, and other areas affected by natural disasters. Thompson's work has led to him being referred to as Houston's \"Hometown Hero\", and from 2008 onwards, July 22 has officially been recognised as \"Trae Day\" in Houston." ;

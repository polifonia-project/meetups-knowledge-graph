        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sergey Konstantinovich Mavrin (Russian: Сергей Константинович Маврин, born 28 February 1963), nicknamed \"Mavrick\" (Маврик), is a Russian musician and composer, who is credited as one of the best guitarists of the Russian metal scene. His music style combines heavy metal, progressive metal and hard rock, and is often dubbed \"MavRock\". Sergey had been a member of Aria, Kipelov, Chorny Kofe, Metallachord and Nazad v Budusheye, and founded the band Mavrik (not to be confused with Maverick), though it is considered Mavrin's solo project since its latest albums are released with \"Sergey Mavrin\", not \"Mavrik\" named on the covers. Since 2000, Sergey has had his own radio show, Iron Curtain, on Yunost radio channel. It is dedicated to rock music." ;

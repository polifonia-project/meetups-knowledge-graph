        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alain Bashung (French: [alɛ̃ baʃuŋ], born Alain Claude Baschung; 1 December 1947 – 14 March 2009) was a French singer, songwriter and actor. Credited with reviving the French chanson in \"a time of French musical turmoil\", he is often regarded in his home country as the most important French rock musician after Serge Gainsbourg. He rose to prominence in the early 1980s with hit songs such as \"Gaby oh Gaby\" and \"Vertige de l'amour\", and later had a string of hit records from the 1990s onward, such as \"Osez Joséphine\", \"Ma petite entreprise\" and \"La nuit je mens\". He has had an influence on many later French artists, and is the most awarded artist in the Victoires de la Musique history with 12 victories obtained throughout his career. Bashung's Play blessures (1982), Osez Joséphine (1991), and Fantaisie militaire (1998) have made multiple French lists of the greatest albums. L'Imprudence (2002) and Bleu pétrole (2008), the last two studio albums released during his lifetime, also garnered acclaim. Bashung died at 61 after a two-year fight with lung cancer." ;

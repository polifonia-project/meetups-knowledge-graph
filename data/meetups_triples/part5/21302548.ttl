        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eddie Kirkland (August 16, 1923 â€“ February 27, 2011) was an American electric blues guitarist, harmonicist, singer, and songwriter. Kirkland, known as the \"Gypsy of the Blues\" for his rigorous touring schedules, played and toured with John Lee Hooker from 1949 to 1962. After his period of working in tandem with Hooker he pursued a successful solo career, recording for RPM Records, Fortune Records, Volt Records, and King Records, sometimes under the stage name Eddie Kirk. Kirkland continued to tour, write and record albums until his death in February 2011. His last performance, the night before his death, was at Dunedin Brewery, Florida." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Himuro Yoshiteru is an electronic music musician and DJ from Japan. Himuro's first album Nichiyobi was released in 1998 by the English record label Worm Interface, alongside artists like Tom Jenkinson (Squarepusher) and Freeform. His releases are mostly within the electronic music genres of drum and bass, Electronica, Hip hop and Braindance, with a significant jazz influence . His style is often described in the media as very playful. It consists of finely chopped, fast rhythms in combination with jazzy bass and synthesizer lines and 8bit sounds (like video game music). In this area he is one of the prominent Japanese musicians of this time. Some of his pieces have been featured on John PeelÂ´s Radio show on BBC Radio 1 and one was later released as an mp3 on the Tribute to John Peel Series, as a free download. In his Live Acts he uses primarily his laptop, MIDI controllers and effects processors." ;

A member of The Phenix Horns, he is best known for his work with Earth, Wind & Fire and Phil Collins. He played alto, tenor, and soprano sax as a member of Earth, Wind & Fire's original horn section, Phenix Horns, from 1975 through 1982. Previously, Myrick had been a member of the musical group The Pharaohs. Myrick is also credited as a founding member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) Some of his most famous saxophone solos include Phil Collins' \"All of My Life\", \"If Leaving Me Is Easy\", and \"One More Night\", the latter featuring Myrick performing the sax solo in the official music video, filmed in a London pub. Another was the live recording of \"Reasons\", featured on the Earth Wind & Fire Gratitude album, and \"After the Love Has Gone\", from the album I Am. He performed with many prominent musicians, including Grover Washington, Jr. and Carlos Santana. Myrick appeared on records by artists including Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, The Dells, Regina Belle, the Mighty Clouds of Joy, and Heaven 17. Earth, Wind & Fire's single \"Runnin'\" earned him the 1977/78 Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental." ;

Born Helen Hubbert in Perkasie, Pennsylvania, she attended the former Sell-Perk High School. She attended Westminster Choir College, where she met her future husband, John S.C. Kemp. The couple married in 1942, and later served on the Church Music faculty at Westminster. The Kemps moved to Oklahoma City in 1949 to work at the city's First Presbyterian Church. They were founding members of the Choristers Guild. In 1968, the couple returned to the faculty of Westminster Choir College. She wrote several books on children's choirs, including Of Primary Importance (1989). She was named Professor Emerita of Voice and Church Music at Westminster upon her retirement." ;

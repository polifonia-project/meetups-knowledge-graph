Born in 1969 in Pljevlja, she was brought up in Sarajevo. Her first album, Ko je ta, was released in 1987 by Diskoton label, while her breakthrough came in 2003. She took a four-year break between 2008 and 2013, which made her lose popularity. She is married to a former footballer named Petar, with whom she has a daughter." ;

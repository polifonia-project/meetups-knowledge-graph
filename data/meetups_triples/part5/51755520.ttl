He has a wide range of works. Working in oil, watercolor and tempera paintings, Herman Travnikov refers to different genres - from common to animalistic. Above all he is known for his watercolor landscapes and portraits. \"I work in different techniques but watercolours seem to be the most sympathetic and sensitive to the motions of human heart. I believe that just watercolours will help me to express what I appreciate in art - truth and beauty.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Borremans (5 April 1769 – 17 July 1827), was a composer of operas, and a violinist and conductor at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Belgium from 1804 to 1825. The composer Charles-Louis-Joseph Hanssens succeeded him as conductor of this opera house. Borremans was born and died in Brussels. The Borremans family was related to the Artot family: his sister was married to Maurice Artot, father of the famous violinist Joseph-Alexander Artot. A Quatuor for the pianoforte harpsichord or with accompaniment of bass and two violone in F, of which a part is missing, is mentioned as number 476 in the inventory of the archives of the House of Arenberg at Edingen." ;

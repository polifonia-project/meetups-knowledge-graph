        mtp:hasAbstract        "Pauline Matthews (born 6 March 1947), better known by her stage name Kiki Dee, is an English singer. Known for her blue-eyed soul vocals, she was the first female singer from the UK to sign with Motown's Tamla Records. Dee is best known for her 1973 hit \"Amoureuse\", her 1974 hit \"I've Got the Music in Me\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", her 1976 duet with Elton John, which went to number 1 on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Her 1981 single \"Star\" became the theme song for the talent show Opportunity Knocks when it was revived by the BBC in 1987. In 1993, she performed another duet with John for his Duets album, a cover version of Cole Porter's \"True Love\", which reached number 2 in the UK. During her career, she has released 40 singles, three EPs and 12 albums." ;

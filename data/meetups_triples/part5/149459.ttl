After an incident in which his girlfriend died by suicide, Green became an ordained pastor and turned to gospel music. He later returned to secular music. Green was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. He was referred to on the museum's site as being \"one of the most gifted purveyors of soul music\". He has also been referred to as \"The Last of the Great Soul Singers\". Green is the winner of 11 Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

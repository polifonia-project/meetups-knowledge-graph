        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martina Mariea McBride (n√©e Schiff, born July 29, 1966) is an American country music singer-songwriter and record producer. She is known for her soprano singing range and her country pop material. McBride was born in Sharon, Kansas, and relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 1989. She signed to RCA Records in 1991, and made her debut the following year as a neo-traditionalist country singer with the single, \"The Time Has Come\". Over time, she developed a pop-styled crossover sound, similar to Shania Twain and Faith Hill, and had a string of major hit singles on the Billboard country chart and occasionally on the adult contemporary chart. Five of these singles went to No. 1 on the country chart between 1995 and 2001, and one peaked at No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart in 2003. McBride has fourteen studio albums, two greatest hits compilations, one \"live\" album, as well as two additional compilation albums. Eight of her studio albums and two of her compilations have an RIAA Gold certification, or higher. In the U.S., she has sold over 14 million albums. In addition, McBride has won the Country Music Association's \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" award four times (tied with Reba McEntire for the third-most wins) and the Academy of Country Music's \"Top Female Vocalist\" award three times. She is also a 14-time Grammy Award nominee." ;

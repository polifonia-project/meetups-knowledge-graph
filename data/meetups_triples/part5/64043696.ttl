        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ricky Dineen (born 2 April 1962) is an Irish musician best known as the guitarist, and at times bassist with the post-punk band Five Go Down to the Sea?, earlier known as Nun Attax, later as Beethoven–fucking–Beethoven. He wrote most of the band's music and developed their angular guitar style, which he said was in part influenced by The Mekons, The Fire Engines and Gang of Four. Five Go Down To The Sea? were active between 1978 and 1985 and released three EPs; Knot a Fish (1983), The Glee Club (1984), and Singing in Braille (1985). His career highlight came in June 1989 after he a collaboration with FGDTS vocalist Finbarr Donnelly as Beethoven Fucking Beethoven, and their EP Him Goolie Goolie Man, Dem was featured as \"Single of the Week\" by the NME. Their success was cut short when Donnelly died in a drowning accident two weeks later. Distraught, Dineen returned to Cork, where he still lives. Five Go Down to the Sea? were hugely influential on later generations of Irish bands such as The Sultans of Ping FC, and are widely credited for the often quirky and deadpan approach of the 1990s and 2000s Cork scene. Since the mid 2010s, Dineen writes for and plays guitar with the self-described \"post-punk geriatric\" group Big Boy Foolish. A keen music fan, his current influences include The Ex, Squid, Idles, and Girl Band." ;

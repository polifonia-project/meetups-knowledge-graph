        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martyn Ware (born 19 May 1956) is an English musician, composer, arranger, record producer, and music programmer. As a founding member of both the Human League and Heaven 17, Ware was partly responsible for hit songs such as \"Being Boiled\" and \"Temptation\". Ware has also worked as a record producer, notably helping to revitalise Tina Turner's career in 1983 with \"Let's Stay Together\", kick starting Terence Trent D'Arby's career by co-producing his solo debut, Introducing the Hardline According to... in 1987 and producing Erasure's I Say I Say I Say album in 1994. He is also noted for work in surround sound technology and, more recently, for creation of sound installations." ;

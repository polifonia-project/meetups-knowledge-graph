        mtp:hasAbstract        "Craig Jones (born February 11, 1972), also known as 133, is an American musician. He is the sampler and keyboardist for the heavy metal band Slipknot, in which he is designated #5. Jones joined the band in early 1996, shortly after the band had finished the recording of its demo album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.. Initially, he was brought in to replace Donnie Steele, one of the two original guitarist, though he quickly moved on to the role of sampling and keyboards. Following the departure of fellow bandmate and drummer Joey Jordison in 2013, Jones is the second-longest-serving member in the band." ;

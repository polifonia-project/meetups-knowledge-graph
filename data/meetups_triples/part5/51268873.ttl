She was signed to Giza Studio and Tent House after she came in second place on fifth season of Super Starlight Contest, the audition hosted by Being. Her debut extended play The Note of My Eighteen Years was released in 2003, and her debut studio album My Favorite Things was released on September 5, 2004. In August 2005, Takei released the single \"Sekai Tomete\", which served as the ending theme song for the Japanese animated television series, Case Closed. The song reached number 27 in Japan and became her best-selling single in her career. In February 2008, Takei released her first compilation album Shiori Takei Best to a moderate commercial success, reaching number 69 in Japan. She reportedly retired from the music industry in 2009 and her name was removed from the artist list of her former label." ;

His work alongside Anderson .Paak as the duo NxWorries has received critical acclaim. In March 2020 he released 1988, his second album for Stones Throw. RIse to Fame He gained popularity rather quickly at first by making his beats line up with freestyles from famous rappers like Meek Mill. This ended up giving him the rise in popularity that attracted millions of fans to his music. Meek Mill shortly threatened DMCA strikes against Knxwledge for using his personal content, which caused Knxwledge to delete every Meek Mill beat he did over his current songs." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Helen Gross (born Hellen R. Gross, May 1896 â€“ unknown) was an American classic female blues singer, active as a recording artist in the mid-1920s. Songs she recorded include \"I Wanna Jazz Some More\", \"Bloody Razor Blues\", and \"Strange Man\". All of her recorded work was from sessions in her birthplace, New York City, between May 1924 and March 1925. She recorded 27 songs, which were originally released by Ajax Records. Steve Leggett, writing for AllMusic, noted that her recordings include \"a preponderance of often baffling noise effects, which at times gives her songs the feel of a carnival sideshow.\" Little is known of her life outside music, and no details of her death are recorded." ;

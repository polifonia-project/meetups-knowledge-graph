He is known for his work on the electronic music label Hyperdub, and in particular for his frequent collaborations with labelmate Kode9. He was described by The Guardian as \"a pioneering Hyperdub artist,\" while Pitchfork Media stated that \"if first-wave UK dubstep had a voice, it belonged to Stephen Gordon.\" Gordon died on 2 October 2014 at the age of 44, following a battle with a rare form of cancer." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Ochs (born 1943) is an American photographic archivist best known for his extensive collection of pictures related to rock music dating back to the 1950s and 1960s. The Michael Ochs Archives, located in Venice, California, contained 3 million vintage prints, proof sheets and negatives which were licensed daily for use in CD reissues, books, films and documentaries. The Los Angeles Times called Ochs \"America's preeminent rock 'n' roll photo archivist\" and described his archive as \"the dominant force in the rock image marketplace\"; The New York Times called it \"the premier source of musician photography in the world\". Ochs sold the archive to Getty Images in 2007." ;

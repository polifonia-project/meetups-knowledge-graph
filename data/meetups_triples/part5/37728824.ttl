        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tauheed K. Epps (born September 12, 1977), known professionally as 2 Chainz (or Tity Boi), is an American rapper. Born and raised in College Park, Georgia, he initially gained recognition as one-half of the Southern hip hop duo Playaz Circle, alongside his longtime friend and fellow rapper Earl \"Dolla Boy\" Conyers. The duo was signed to fellow Georgia-based rapper Ludacris' Disturbing tha Peace label, and are best known for their debut single \"Duffle Bag Boy\" (featuring Lil Wayne). In February 2012, Epps signed a solo record deal with Def Jam Recordings, an imprint of Universal Music Group. The following August, he released his debut studio album Based on a T.R.U. Story on August 14, 2012, to commercial success despite mixed reviews. The album spawned three successful singles: \"No Lie\" (featuring Drake), \"Birthday Song\" (featuring Kanye West), and \"I'm Different\", all of which charted in the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100 and were certified Gold or higher by the RIAA, along with the album being certified Gold. His second studio album B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time was released on September 11, 2013; supported by the lead single \"Feds Watching\" (featuring Pharrell Williams). Epps began working with TV network Viceland on a show called Most Expensivest, which debuted on November 15, 2017, and aired for three seasons." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Reverend A. W. Nix (1880 â€“ 1949) was an American preacher who recorded 54 sermons and gospel songs in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He is best remembered for his commercially successful sermon, \"Black Diamond Express to Hell.\" Nix's recordings were reintroduced when he was credited as a major influence on Thomas A. Dorsey, the \"father of gospel music.\" However, the minutes of the 1921 National Baptist Convention confirm that Nix's brother, William Nix, Jr., was actually the influence on Dorsey. Accordingly, nearly all of A.W.'s sermons have been reissued on Document Records and compilation albums." ;

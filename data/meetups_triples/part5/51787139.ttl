She is one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Mexican cinema.

She recorded exclusively for RCA Víctor, and her recordings featured accompaniment by the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán. She made her film debut as a musical guest in the comedy El hombre inquieto (1954), starring Germán Valdés and Joaquín Pardavé. She acted in Lupe Balazos, starring Lucha Moreno and Julio Aldama." ;

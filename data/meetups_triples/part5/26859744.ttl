        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julián Bautista (21 April 1901 – 8 July 1961) was a Spanish composer and conductor. He was a member of Generation of '27 and the Group of Eight, the latter of which also included composers Jesús Bal y Gay, Ernesto Halffter and his brother Rodolfo, Juan José Mantecón, Fernando Remacha, Rosa García Ascot, Salvador Bacarisse and Gustavo Pittaluga. He composed the soundtracks to 37 movies in addition to more than 30 other classical works. He worked actively as a conductor with such orchestras as the Madrid Symphony Orchestra and the Spanish National Orchestra. Bautista was the son of Julián Bautista Swartz and Ventura Cachaza Vázquez. He began studying solfège at the age of 7 and piano at the age of 11 with Pilar Fernández de la Mora. At the age of 14 he began taking courses in harmony, counterpoint, and fugue at the Madrid Royal Conservatory where he was a pupil of Conrado del Campo. In 1940 he emigrated to Argentina, where he lived in Buenos Aires." ;

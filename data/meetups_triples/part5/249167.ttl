Known for his sweet and soulful vocals, Vandross has sold over 40 million records worldwide. He achieved eleven consecutive Platinum albums and eight Grammy Awards, including Best Male R&B Vocal Performance four different times. In 2004, Vandross won a total of four Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for a song recorded not long before his death, \"Dance with My Father\". Vandross worked as a backing vocalist in the 1970s, and appeared on albums by artists such as Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, Todd Rundgren, Judy Collins, Chaka Khan, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, David Bowie, Ben E. King, Stevie Wonder, and Donna Summer. He later became a lead singer of the group Change, which released its Gold-certified debut album, The Glow of Love, in 1980 on Warner/RFC Records. After Vandross left the group, he was signed to Epic Records as a solo artist and released his debut solo album, Never Too Much, in 1981. His hit songs include \"Never Too Much\", \"Here and Now\", \"Any Love\", \"Power of Love/Love Power\", \"I Can Make It Better\" and \"For You to Love\". Many of his songs were covers of original music by other artists such as \"If This World Were Mine\" (duet with Cheryl Lynn), \"Since I Lost My Baby\", \"Superstar\", \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" and \"Always and Forever\". Duets such as \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Beyoncé, \"Endless Love\" with Mariah Carey and \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\" with Janet Jackson were all hit songs in his career." ;

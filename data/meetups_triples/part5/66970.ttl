        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bat-Sheva Ofra Haza (Hebrew: בת-שבע עפרה חזה; 19 November 1957 – 23 February 2000), known professionally as Ofra Haza (עפרה חזה), was an Israeli singer, actress, and Grammy Award-nominated recording artist commonly known in the Western world as \"The Israeli Madonna\", or \"Madonna of the East\". Her voice has been described as a \"tender\" mezzo-soprano. Of Mizrahi Jewish (Yemenite-Jewish) descent, Haza's music is known as a mixture of traditional and commercial singing styles, fusing elements of Eastern and Western instrumentation, orchestration and dance-beat. She became successful in Europe and the Americas; during her singing career, she earned many platinum and gold discs. In Israel, Haza was an influential cultural figure who helped to popularize Mizrahi culture." ;

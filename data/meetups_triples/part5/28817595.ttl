        mtp:hasAbstract        "Travis Lazarus \"Travie\" McCoy (born August 5, 1981) is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He is the co-founder and former lead vocalist of the rap rock band Gym Class Heroes, in addition to having a solo career. McCoy became involved with punk rock scenes as a teenager. He formed the band Gym Class Heroes with childhood friend Matt McGinley; after several line-up changes, the group was signed to Fueled by Ramen, which released their debut album. Gym Class Heroes took a three-year hiatus from music, leaving McCoy to focus on his solo career; McCoy released, under T-Pain's label Nappy Boy Entertainment, his debut solo album, Lazarus, in 2010. The lead single from the album, \"Billionaire\" (featuring Bruno Mars), peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three on the UK Singles Chart. In 2021, McCoy signed with Hopeless Records and released his first single in six years \"A Spoonful Of Cinnamon\" on June 18." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Wu Yi Fan (Chinese: 吴亦凡,pronounced [ǔ î fǎn]; born 6 November 1990), known professionally as Kris Wu, is a Chinese-born Canadian former rapper, singer, actor and model, and convicted serial rapist. He is a former member of South Korean-Chinese boy band Exo and its subgroup Exo-M under SM Entertainment, before leaving the group in 2014. Wu was active as a solo artist and actor in Mainland China, and had starred in several number-one box office hits including Mr. Six and Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back, which are among the highest-grossing Chinese films of all time in China. He made his Hollywood debut in XXX: Return of Xander Cage. On 31 July 2021, Wu was detained by Beijing police after multiple rape allegations emerged on Chinese social media. In August 2021, the People's Procuratorate of Chaoyang District of Beijing approved his arrest on suspicion of rape. On 25 November 2022, the Beijing court sentenced Wu to a total of 13 years in prison, to be followed by deportation from China." ;

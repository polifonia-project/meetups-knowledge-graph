        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel House (born August 8, 1961) is an American business owner / entrepreneur and musician who is best known for his contribution to the Seattle \"grunge\" music movement of the 1980s and â€˜90s. He was a co-founder and bass-player for Skin Yard, a band that was active from 1985 to 1992, and was president and owner of C/Z Records, a Seattle-based independent record label that released music by many bands including 7 Year Bitch, Built to Spill, Coffin Break, Engine Kid, The Gits, Hammerbox, Love Battery, The Melvins, The Presidents of the United States of America, Silkworm, and Skin Yard. In 2003 he moved from Seattle to Los Angeles where he oversaw the development and creation of the now-defunct www.DownloadPunk.com as well as the music-centric (now offline) online dating website, RocknRollDating.com." ;

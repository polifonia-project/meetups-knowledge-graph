In 2008, she starred as \"Serra Paylin\", a parody of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, in Hustler Video's Who's Nailin' Paylin?, which was released on Election Day. Her directorial film, MILF Revolution (2013), won the 2014 AVN Award for \"Best MILF Release\". In December 2014, she launched Porn Stars Boot Camp, a consulting firm, and also announced her retirement from performing in adult films; she had breast reduction surgery shortly after retiring as part of her return adult entertainment retirement. Four years later, in 2018, Ann announced her comeback to the adult industry, signing with Evil Angel. Prior to beginning her adult entertainment career, Ann appeared as a \"Snapple Girl\" on The Howard Stern Show. She played Palin in the music video for the song \"We Made You\" by American rapper Eminem.

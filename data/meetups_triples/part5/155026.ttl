        mtp:hasAbstract        "Manos Hatzidakis (also spelled Hadjidakis; Greek: Μάνος Χατζιδάκις; 23 October 1925 – 15 June 1994) was a Greek composer and theorist of Greek music, widely considered to be one of the greatest Greek composers and one of the most globally recognised. His legacy and contribution are widespread among the works of contemporary Greek music, through the second half of the 20th and into the 21st century. He was also one of the main proponents of the \"Éntekhno\" form of music (along with Mikis Theodorakis).In 1960, he received an Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song Never on Sunday from the film of the same name." ;

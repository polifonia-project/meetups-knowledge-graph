        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ruth Crawford Seeger (born Ruth Porter Crawford; July 3, 1901 â€“ November 18, 1953) was an American composer and folk music specialist. Her music was a prominent exponent of the emerging modernist aesthetic and she became a central member of a group of American composers known as the \"ultramoderns\". Though she composed primarily during the 1920s and 1930s, Seeger turned towards studies on folk music from the late 1930s until her death. Her music influenced later composers, particularly Elliott Carter." ;

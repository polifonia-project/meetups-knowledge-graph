Born and raised in Arlington, Texas, Morris enjoyed singing as a child. She started publicly performing in her preteen years and toured throughout Texas. In her late teens and early twenties, she released three studio albums on independent record labels. She relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in country music during this same time period. Morris signed a publishing contract and later a recording contract following the streaming success of her 2015 self-titled EP. Morris's fourth studio album Hero (2016) was released on Columbia Nashville and blended country with R&B styles. Its lead single \"My Church\" became her breakout single at country radio and was followed by the commercially successful songs \"80s Mercedes\", \"I Could Use a Love Song\" and \"Rich\". In 2018, Morris collaborated with Grey and Zedd on the song \"The Middle\". Released as a single, the track became a top ten pop success in various countries.

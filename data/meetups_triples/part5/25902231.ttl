        mtp:hasAbstract        "Maki Asakawa (浅川マキ, Asakawa Maki, January 27, 1942 – January 17, 2010) was a Japanese jazz and blues singer, lyricist and composer. She was an important voice of the Japanese urban counterculture. It is written in The Japan Times that she \"made her name in 1970\" with The World of Maki Asakawa and is known for songs like \"Yo ga Aketara\" and \"Kamome\", as well as for the Darkness collections. Conversely, Thom Jurek of AllMusic described her album Blue Spirit Blues (1972) as \"perhaps her most memorable recording\" and reported that works such as Maki II (1971) and Cat Nap (1982) are well-known. Ben Ratliff wrote, \"Some of the most intense recordings she made were English-language covers or Japanese rewrites of American jazz standards, blues songs, and spirituals, backed by only acoustic guitar and drums. (If you can get her 1972 album Blue Spirit Blues, you'll hear this tendency clearest.) She sang slowly, as if there were weights on her.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Antonio Pastor (May 28, 1837 â€“ August 26, 1908) was an American impresario, variety performer and theatre owner who became one of the founding forces behind American vaudeville in the mid- to late-nineteenth century. He was sometimes referred to as the \"Dean of Vaudeville.\" The strongest elements of his entertainments were an almost jingoistic brand of United States patriotism and a strong commitment to attracting a \"mixed-gender\" audience, the latter being something revolutionary in the male-oriented variety halls of the mid-century. Although he was a performer and producer, Pastor is best known for \"cleaning up\" bawdy variety acts and presenting a clean and family friendly genre called vaudeville. A collection of his papers is maintained at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas in Austin, and in the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts." ;

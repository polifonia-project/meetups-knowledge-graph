She is a solo artist, previously a member of the alternative rock band JJ72, with which she played bass guitar from 1996 until 2003. JJ72 had success with two Top 20 albums in the early 2000s with Woods as the bassist. She quit the music industry until 2014, returning with her first solo EP entitled Night. Woods' solo albums have a gentle, ambient folk sound with \"nocturnal keyboard-based songs.\" Her musical inspiration comes from filmmakers, electronic artists, experimental noise, and folk music traditions. She is currently signed to Sacred Bones Records." ;

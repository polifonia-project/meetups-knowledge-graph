        mtp:hasAbstract        "Matthew Thomas Skiba (born February 24, 1976) is an American musician, singer and songwriter, known for his role as the founding lead vocalist and guitarist for Alkaline Trio and was the guitarist and co-lead vocalist of the band Blink-182 from 2015 to 2022. Skiba's lyrical content commonly involves dark romantic themes. Alkaline Trio formed in 1996 with Skiba as the frontman. Since then, the band has released nine full-length albums over two decades. Skiba also recorded albums with side projects including Heavens and the Hell, as well as two full-length solo albums with his backing band, the Sekrets. Following Tom DeLonge's second departure from Blink-182 in early 2015, Skiba was hired as their touring guitarist for three shows and then became an official member later that year; he recorded two albums with the band before DeLonge returned in 2022." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sonika Keturah Jermina Mckie (born October 21, 1988), known simply as Sonika, is a Grenadian singer-songwriter and recording artist, based in the Eastern Caribbean island of Grenada. Born in St. George's, Grenada, her professional career began when she was approached, by the Manager of Metronome Records, Nima Anvar, who had seen her performance on May 29, 2010 at the Grenada Best Talent Competition Final(an initiative of Wayne \"Waggy T\" Redhead and other local sponsors). Shortly after this, Anvar offered Sonika an opportunity to be managed by him and to develop her career. During 2011, Sonika accepted the offer. Under Anvar's management, Sonika was introduced to an organized method for approaching her development as a serious artist. In the process, Anvar pulled in a team of persons to develop Sonika into an international artist. Team members at the inception included local talk show host of Chit Chat and media personality, Lexan Fletcher [originally a co-partner at Metronome Records], who assisted as an image consultant; Annette Moore, who advised on social media strategies and development; Hervin Hood, a Full Sail University Music & Entertainment Business alum, Anvar's then co-partner at Metronome Records who dealt with studio recording, assisted by Joshua \"J-Beatz\" Benjamin, a young sound engineer prodigy; Xpert Productions/Studio, which comprises John James and his brother Jason 'Xpert' James from the neighboring island of Carriacou; Sean \"Fame\" Nelson, a UK-based, Grenadian Music Producer; Samuel Ogilvie, who did the storyboarding for Sonika's music videos and who also assisted with the filming of videos and the video recording of several of her covers; Darryl Friday, a film school graduate, who filmed and edited Sonika's Gone Away music video, as well as other consultants, who assisted with image development and brand marketing. In 2013, due to pressing responsibilities Anvar handed management over to artist development associate, Annette Moore, who, together with consultant, Mike Adams, continued Sonika's development. In 2015 Sonika and Moore parted ways, having also done so with Adams in 2013, when he migrated. Corporate sponsors, including Smiths Grenada [Monica Smith]; Chalene's Beauty Salon & School of Cosmetology; Jus Fashion Grenada; Lima Es Photography [Salima Esmail]; Solana J. Boutique; Silhouette by Neisha LaTouche; Make-up Artist, Divya Armanani-Noel and others, all played a role in the image building and professional development of Sonika's career. To date, Sonika has released five singles between April 2012 and September 2013; she has sung to audiences both locally and internationally; released a music video for her first single, \"Gone Away\", which went to No. 1 on Tempo Networks; is the first Grenadian artist to have a VEVO channel and recently filmed and is about to release a music video for \"Please Don't Let It Go\" (her second single). Sonika is currently working on writing and recording more original singles and clearly defining her sound, style and image." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Frankie Lee Sims (April 30, 1917, New Orleans, Louisiana â€“ May 10, 1970, Dallas, Texas) was an American singer-songwriter and electric blues guitarist. He released nine singles during his career, one of which, \"Lucy Mae Blues\" (1953), was a regional hit. Two compilation albums of his work were released posthumously. Sims was the cousin of another Texas blues musician, Lightnin' Hopkins, and he worked with several other prominent blues musicians, including Texas Alexander, T-Bone Walker, King Curtis and Albert Collins. Sims is regarded as an important figure in postwar Texas country blues." ;

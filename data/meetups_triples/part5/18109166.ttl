In 2008, at the age of 10, she won the second season of the talent show Talang, the Swedish version of the Got Talent format. Since then she has received recognition with singles including \"Lush Life\" (2015), \"Never Forget You\" (2015), \"Girls Like\" (2016) featuring Tinie Tempah and \"Ain't My Fault\" (2016). She later featured on Clean Bandit's single, \"Symphony\" (2017), topping the charts in the UK and Sweden. Her third studio album in 2021 was preceded by the international hit \"Ruin My Life\" (2018). Earlier in 2012, Larsson had signed with the record label TEN Music Group and subsequently released her debut extended play Introducing in January 2013. The EP was supported by Larsson's first original single, \"Uncover\", which topped the music charts in Scandinavia and was certified 6x platinum in Sweden. Following her early success in Scandinavia and the release of her debut album, 1 (2014), Larsson signed a three-year contract with Epic Records in the United States. In 2016, Larsson performed at the opening and closing ceremonies for UEFA Euro in France. Larsson's second studio album, So Good, was released in March 2017. The album was supported by eight singles, including \"Lush Life\", \"Never Forget You\", and \"Ain't My Fault\", all of which reached number one in Sweden, with the latter debuting atop the chart. She would later be featured on Clean Bandit's single, \"Symphony\", which topped the charts in the UK and Sweden. Her third studio album, Poster Girl (2021), was preceded by the international hit \"Ruin My Life\" (2018) debuting in the Top 10 in Sweden, Ireland and the UK while receiving a Gold certification or higher in ten countries." ;

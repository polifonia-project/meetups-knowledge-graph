        mtp:hasAbstract        "Steve Thomas Lacy-Moya (born May 23, 1998) is an American singer, musician, songwriter, and record producer. He gained recognition as the guitarist of the alternative R&B band the Internet. In 2017, he released his self-produced debut EP, Steve Lacy's Demo. Following this, Lacy was featured alongside Frank Ocean on the song \"911 / Mr. Lonely\" by Tyler, the Creator; and co-wrote songs for artists such as Solange Knowles, Chloe x Halle, and Kendrick Lamar, the latter of whom he worked with on the song \"Pride\". His debut studio album, Apollo XXI (2019), earned him a nomination for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. He would be featured on the single \"Sunflower\" by Vampire Weekend, that same year. He then collaborated with Calvin Harris (under the moniker Love Regenerator) on the song \"Live Without Your Love\", which earned him a chart entry in the United Kingdom. His second studio album, Gemini Rights (2022), peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart. The album spawned the single \"Bad Habit\", which became Lacy's first song to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after going viral on TikTok, where a snippet of the song was used as the soundtrack for over 400,000 videos on the platform. It earned him two Grammy Award nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. Gemini Rights was also nominated for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2022 Grammys." ;

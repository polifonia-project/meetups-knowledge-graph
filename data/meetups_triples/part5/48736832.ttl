        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bill Kahan Kapri (born Dieuson Octave; June 11, 1997), better known by his stage name Kodak Black, is an American rapper. He gained initial recognition with his single \"No Flockin\", released in 2014. His debut album, Painting Pictures (2017), peaked at number three on the US Billboard 200 and included the Billboard Hot 100 top 10 single \"Tunnel Vision\". Black's second album, Dying to Live (2018), peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and was supported by the single \"Zeze\" (featuring Travis Scott and Offset), which peaked at number 2 on the Hot 100. Kodak Black's career has been marked by periods of mainstream success, as well as public controversies and legal issues. His legal troubles began in middle school and spiked significantly throughout the late 2010s. In 2019, Black was arrested for weapons possession and was sentenced to almost four years in federal prison; his sentence was commuted by President Donald Trump in 2021. While incarcerated, he released his third studio album, Bill Israel (2020). His fourth studio album, Back for Everything followed in 2022, and contains the hit single \"Super Gremlin\" as a bonus track." ;

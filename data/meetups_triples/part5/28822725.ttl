        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Leroy O'Gwynn (January 26, 1928 â€“ January 19, 2011) was an American country music singer. Between 1958 and 1962, he recorded for the D and Mercury labels, charting six times on the Hot Country Songs charts. His work on the D label was produced by Pappy Daily, best known for producing George Jones. O'Gwynn's highest-peaking single came during his Mercury career, when he reached No. 7 with \"My Name Is Mud.\" None of his other singles afterward made the charts, and he moved among several labels, including United Artists Records and Plantation Records." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zhanna Vladimirovna Bichevskaya (English: Jeanne Bichevskaya; Russian: Жанна Владимировна Бичевская; born June 17, 1944) is a prominent Russian singer and folk musician. She was born in Moscow. In 1971 she graduated from the Moscow Circus and Performing Arts School. She was a teacher of music in Zagorsk (Sergiev Posad). In the 1970s, Zhanna started to perform Russian folk songs and romances. At that time she was influenced by Bulat Okudzhava, and she gained popularity in Russia and abroad with some critics dubbing her the Russian Joan Baez. Her unique style of music is described as Russian country-folk. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Zhanna Bichevskaya's songs began to have more political, nationalist and spiritual themes. She performed a series of White Guard officer's songs, as well as a series of patriotic, monarchist and religious songs, some times songs dedicated to the Romanov Holy Martyrs. The lyrics to the latter were composed by Father Roman, a priest of the Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery. Her album \"Hieromonk Romans's songs\" was blessed by him in 1997. In 1999, Zhanna also became the host of her own show on Voice of Russia radio station. She was awarded People’s Artist of the RSFSR." ;

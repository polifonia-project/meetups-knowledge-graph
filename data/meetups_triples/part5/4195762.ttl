        mtp:hasAbstract        "Erik Martin \"Axe\" Axenrot (born 5 March 1979 in Linköping, Sweden) is a Swedish death metal drummer, best known as the former drummer for progressive death metal band Opeth from 2006 to 2021. Since 2004, he is the drummer for Bloodbath. Known for his intricate playing style, his drumming has been highly praised by Opeth members and fans, with Mikael Åkerfeldt calling him \"a joy to play with.\" Axenrot has also been jokingly referred to as The Lord of the Rings character Legolas by band members and fans. On Blabbermouth.com, Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that Axenrot completed his drumming parts for eleven tracks on the Opeth album Watershed in just seven days. Nathalie Lorichs, who performed vocals on \"Coil\" on Opeth's Watershed album, is Axenrot's girlfriend." ;

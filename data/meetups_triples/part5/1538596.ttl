        mtp:hasAbstract        "Earl Zebedee Hooker (January 15, 1930 â€“ April 21, 1970) was a Chicago blues guitarist known for his slide guitar playing. Considered a \"musician's musician\", he performed with blues artists such as Sonny Boy Williamson II, Junior Wells, and John Lee Hooker and fronted his own bands. An early player of the electric guitar, Hooker was influenced by the modern urban styles of T-Bone Walker and Robert Nighthawk. He recorded several singles and albums as a bandleader and with other well-known artists. His \"Blue Guitar\", a slide guitar instrumental single, was popular in the Chicago area and was later overdubbed with vocals by Muddy Waters as \"You Shook Me\". In the late 1960s, Hooker began performing on the college and concert circuit and had several recording contracts. Just as his career was on an upswing, he died in 1970, at age 40, after a lifelong struggle with tuberculosis. His guitar playing has been acknowledged by many of his peers, including B.B. King, who commented, \"to me he is the best of modern guitarists. Period. With the slide he was the best. It was nobody else like him, he was just one of a kind\"." ;

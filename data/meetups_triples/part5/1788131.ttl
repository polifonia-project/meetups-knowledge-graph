        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clyde Julian \"Red\" Foley (June 17, 1910 â€“ September 19, 1968) was an American musician who made a major contribution to the growth of country music after World War II. For more than two decades, Foley was one of the biggest stars of the genre, selling more than 25 million records. His 1951 hit, \"Peace in the Valley\", was among the first million-selling gospel records. A Grand Ole Opry veteran until his death, Foley also hosted the first popular country music series on network television, Ozark Jubilee, from 1955 to 1960. He is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, which called him \"one of the most versatile and moving performers of all time\" and \"a giant influence during the formative years of contemporary Country music.\"" ;

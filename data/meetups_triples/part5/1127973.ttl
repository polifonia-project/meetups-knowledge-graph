        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Frederick Gibbons (born December 16, 1949) is an American rock musician, best known as the guitarist and primary vocalist of ZZ Top. He began his career in the Moving Sidewalks, who recorded Flash (1968) and opened four dates for the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Gibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969 and released ZZ Top's First Album in early 1971. He has also maintained a solo career in recent years, starting with his first album Perfectamundo (2015). Gibbons possesses a gravelly bass-baritone singing voice and is known for his bluesy, groove based guitar style. Gibbons is also recognized for the chest-length beard he has worn since 1979, a look he shared with ZZ Top bassist Dusty Hill until Hill's death in 2021. Gibbons has made appearances with other artists and acted on television shows, most notably Bones. In 2001, Rolling Stone named him the 32nd greatest guitarist of all time." ;

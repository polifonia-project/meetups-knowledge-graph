        mtp:hasAbstract        "Louis Charles \"B.W.\" Stevenson (October 5, 1949 â€“ April 28, 1988) was an American country pop singer and musician, working in a genre now called progressive country. \"B.W.\" stood for \"Buckwheat\". Stevenson was born in Dallas, Texas, United States, and attended W.H. Adamson High School with other musicians Michael Martin Murphey, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and Larry Groce. Stevenson performed and was taped for the intended pilot of Austin City Limits on October 13, 1974. However, the recording quality was deemed too poor to broadcast. Willie Nelson's performance taped the following night was aired as the first episode of the program." ;

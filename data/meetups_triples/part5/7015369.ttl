        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian Tutunick is an American musician, more famously known as Olivia Newton Bundy, and was the bassist and co-founder of the rock group Marilyn Manson until 1990, when he was replaced by Gidget Gein. His stage name was created by mixing the names of Olivia Newton-John, singer; and Ted Bundy, serial killer. In 1993, Tutunick's new band Collapsing Lungs (also known as L.U.N.G.S.) was signed to Atlantic Records. In 1996, Tutunick, along with notable DJ Grynch created a new band, Nation of Fear. They released the song \"Immortal\" on a compilation CD for the (now defunct) rock station 94.9 WZTA. Later that year Nation of Fear would release their well-received self-titled album on DiMar Records. They would go on tour with Genitorturers and were even joined on tour by Lords of Acid. Nation of Fear (like their tour-mates) were known for stage antics including S&M, powertools, and pyrotechnics. In 1998, the band's second release Everything Beautiful Rusts, while receiving much more attention, failed to keep the band together and by 2000 they had broken up." ;

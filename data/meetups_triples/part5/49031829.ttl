        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alan Olav Walker (born 24 August 1997) is a British-born Norwegian DJ, YouTuber and record producer primarily known for the critically acclaimed single \"Faded\" (2015), which was certified platinum in 14 countries. He has also made several songs including \"Sing Me to Sleep\", \"Alone\", \"Darkside\", and \"On My Way\", all of which attracted millions of views on YouTube. In early 2017, Walker's channel emerged as the most subscribed YouTube channel registered in Norway, with then 41.9 million subscribers as of May 2022. He also has the most views of any Norwegian creator, with approximately 11.1 billion views as of 21 February 2022. Although many critics and fans have viewed Walker as one of the pioneers of electronic dance music, several have criticized him for hiring \"ghost producers\", while some fans were divided and generated concerns over his usual departure from his typical production style, most notably in his recently released songs." ;

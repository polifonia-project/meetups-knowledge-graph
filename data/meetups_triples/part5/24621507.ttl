        mtp:hasAbstract        "Herbert Raymond \"Ray\" Pillow (born July 4, 1937) is an American country music singer who has also worked as a music publisher and artists and repertoire (A&R) representative. In his career, he has charted 18 times on the Billboard country singles chart, with his highest-peaking song being the number 9 \"I'll Take the Dog\", a duet with Jean Shepard. After charting for the last time in 1981, Pillow founded Sycamore Records with Larry McFadden, and later worked in the A&R department of Capitol Records. Today, Pillow continues to perform as a member of the Grand Ole Opry and on popular classic country television programs such as Country's Family Reunion, which airs regularly in the United States on RFD-TV network. Through his record label, Pillow has released two albums, including Ray Pillow Live and his recent studio effort containing new material, Country Class. Pillow has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1966." ;

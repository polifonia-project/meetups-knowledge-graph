        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Barry Donegan (born November 16, 1978) is an American singer, songwriter, writer, political activist, and political candidate best known as the lead singer of the rock band Look What I Did. He is also working on a side project with Evan Brewer of Animosity which is in the writing stage according to MTV Metal File. He is a candidate for City Council at Large in Nashville, Tennessee, for 2015, although the local Nashville elections are technically non-partisan. Donegan was elected and served as director at large of the Davidson County Republican Party from 2009-2011 and currently writes political columns for the website of the national chapter of the Republican Liberty Caucus. In 2008, he wrote an election-year political column called \"Dangerous Truth\" for the heavy metal music e-zine thegauntlet.com and was at one time a featured writer for the libertarian-themed online magazine, thefreedomrevolution.com." ;

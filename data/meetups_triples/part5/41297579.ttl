Hand was widely credited with opening the door for Black women's participation in the previously male-dominated techno and electronic music communities during the 1990s and was known as the \"First Lady of Detroit techno\". A prolific DJ with an \"impossibly deep catalogue\", Hand continued to produce and perform music up until her death in 2021." ;

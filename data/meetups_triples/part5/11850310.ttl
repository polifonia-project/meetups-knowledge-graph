        mtp:hasAbstract        "Josephine Antoine (October 27, 1907 – October 30, 1971) is a coloratura soprano, who sang at the Metropolitan Opera from 1936 through 1948 in 76 appearances, and was well known in \"Un ballo in maschera\", \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\", \"Les contes d'Hoffmann\", \"Le Coq d'Or\", \"Don Giovanni\", \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", \"Mignon\", \"Parsifal\", \"Rigoletto\", and \"Die Zauberflöte.\" She made at least six commercial recordings for Columbia, but there may be more. Her career also included radio where she appeared on \"Chevrolet Musical Moments Revue\" in 1937. Miss Antoine was a regular star on NBC Radio's \"The Carnation Contented Hour\" (\"The Melody Hour,\" without commercials, at Armed Forces Radio Service) with Percy Faith during World War II. Miss Antoine was a favorite at Chautauqua Institution, New York where she had been soloist for many seasons. Hence she was affectionately known as \"Chautauqua's Sweetheart.\"" ;

One commentator noted that Kirkpatrick's 1996 album, Going Back to Texas, \"is a charming record. Kirkpatrick has a classy, jazzy guitar style and he leads his band through a set of originals and covers, putting an attractive, swinging spin on the music.\" Kirkpatrick was primarily influenced by B.B. King." ;

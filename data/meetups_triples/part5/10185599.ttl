        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Readman (born 6 July 1970) is an English singer best known as the vocalist of hard rock band Pink Cream 69 and former vocalist of progressive metal band Adagio. He released a solo album in 2007 and was part of German guitarist Alex Beyrodt's band Voodoo Circle, from 2008 to 2016, returning in 2020. In 2015, two new projects featuring Readman on lead vocals were announced. The first called Room Experience, is a melodic rock project led by Italian musician Gianluca Firmo, with a self-titled album released in May 2015. And the second is Almanac, the new heavy metal band led by former Rage guitarist Victor Smolski. In September 2016 it was announced he had reformed the David Readman Band, his solo band that he founded in Germany. It now features Dutch musicians Emile Marcelis (ex-Vengeance, bass), Eddie Claessens (Vandale, drums) and Bram Engelen (Ostrogoth, guitars). Readman joined British heavy metal band Tank in 2017. In October of the same year, a new project called Pendulum of Fortune came out, featuring Readman with Bodo Schopf, Franky R. and led by Vladimir Shevjakov. In 2020, while the world was being plunged into a lockdown along with Julien Spreutels, Francesco Mattei, Nicolas Spreutels and Dennis Thomas, founded Immunity for the Masses, and released their first track ‘Welcome To This Nightmare’ a project that defied all laws of music by being written and fully produced remotely from all corners of Europe all within two weeks." ;

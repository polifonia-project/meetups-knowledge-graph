He was one of the founding members of , a metal band formed with friends Andy Gerold (former touring bassist for Marilyn Manson) and Tim Kelleher (former touring bassist for Thirty Seconds to Mars). My Darling Murder broke up in 2006, according to a statement released by the band itself, and in the fall of that year, Mallin joined Kill Hannah on the road as their touring drummer. He has since mid-2007 been featured in interviews, photo shoots, and press as a full member of Kill Hannah. Although a full-time member in Kill Hannah, Mallin has also been performing as the live drummer for Kesha since her Spring 2010 appearance on Saturday Night Live. He also performed as the hired gun in Hollywood Undead from late 2009â€“2010 before joining Kesha forever. Mallin, Gerold, and Kelleher reformed My Darling Murder, with singer Jared Woosely.

In 2012 Mallin joined platinum selling rock band Filter for a short stint along with super group Fear and the Nervous System (led by James \"Munky\" Schaffer from Korn). Elias returned to Kesha in late 2012.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Joseph Daverio (October 19, 1954 â€“ March 16, 2003) was a violinist, scholar, teacher and author, best known for his writings on the music of Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms. His research interests centered around Austro-German composers including J. S. Bach, Mozart, Schubert, Wagner and Post-Romantic composers such as R. Strauss and Mahler. Just before his sudden death, he was exploring the concept of \"late Style\" in the music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. All of his writings feature the relation of music to literature and philosophy. Daverio was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, the only son of Italian-American parents. He was a professor of music at Boston University and chairman of the CFA school of music musicology department and of the CAS and GRS department of music and ad interim director of the school of music; Daverio received the University's Metcalf Award for Excellence in Teaching. Daverio died under mysterious circumstances, drowning in the Charles River at the age of 48. It remains unclear whether his death was accident or suicide, though foul play has been ruled out. Some have noted an unfortunate irony in the manner of Daverio's death, as Robert Schumann attempted suicide in 1854 by throwing himself into the Rhine river, and Daverio was among the world's leading Schumann scholars." ;

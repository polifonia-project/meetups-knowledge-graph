        mtp:hasAbstract        "HÃ©ctor Juan Pedro Bosio Bertolotti (born 1 October 1958) better known by his stage name Zeta Bosio, is an Argentine rock musician, record producer and disc jockey (DJ), better known as the bassist of the Argentine rock band Soda Stereo. He was also the bassist of Chilean band La Ley between 2013 and 2014. Nowadays he plays in the band Shoot the Radio, which he co-founded. Bosio, along with Gustavo Cerati and Charly Alberti, formed Soda Stereo in 1982. They recorded over a dozen records until they disbanded in 1997. Since then, he kept a low profile until quite recently. ProyectoUnder.com is the music portal chosen by Bosio as a way to promote underground bands. Bosio is now working with his independent record label Alerta Discos. He has produced albums for bands such as \"Aguirre\" and \"Peligrosos Gorriones\". Also, he presented a TV show called \"Rock Road\" for Much Music Argentina and the Chilean channel Via X. In 2011, he was a judge in the Chilean TV show Factor X." ;

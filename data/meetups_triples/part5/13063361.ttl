He is known for his work in Fallout, Fallout 2 and Planescape: Torment, and for being a former member of Starship. He was born in Los Angeles, California, to an architect, Melford Morgan and Betty Morgan, a classically trained pianist. It was while living with his parents that he became interested in music, and started to learn to play the piano. Upon graduating from high school, he moved to Boston, where he enrolled in the Berklee College Of Music, where he studied piano and composition, and where he learned about electronic music. In 1988, he joined Starship on keyboards, played on the Love Among the Cannibals album with the band, and toured with them until 1990." ;

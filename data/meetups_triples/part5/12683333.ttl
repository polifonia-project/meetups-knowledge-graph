After the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano, which destroyed Armero and left 25,000 people dead, Chucho organized a charity concert for the survivors. David Gilmour, Annie Lennox, Pete Townshend, and Mike Oldfield participated in this event. With the funds acquired, charity works were done in Colombia, including a school, a sports center, and a brick factory. This is when FONEVA was born, a charity which he manages and which helps children, elderly people, and animals in Colombia. He conducted The London Philharmonic Orchestra for Pete Townsend's album Iron Man and recorded the bass in Scoop, White City and Deep End Live and was the musical director on the tour of The Who which celebrated their 25th anniversary.

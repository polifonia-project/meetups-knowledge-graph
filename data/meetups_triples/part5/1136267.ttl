He held that position from 1944 until his retirement in 1988. Jacobs was considered one of the foremost brass pedagogues of his time as well as an expert on breathing as it related to brasswind, woodwind, and vocal performance. Due to childhood illness and adult onset asthma, his lung capacity was significantly impaired. He is best remembered for his playing philosophy which he referred to as \"Song and Wind.\"" ;

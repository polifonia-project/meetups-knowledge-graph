        mtp:hasAbstract        "Soledad Rendón Bueno (9 July 1943 – 18 August 1970), better known by her stage names Soledad Miranda or Susann Korda (or sometimes Susan Korday), was an actress and pop singer who was born in Seville, Spain. She starred in several erotic thriller films directed by Jess Franco in 1969 and 1970, such as Count Dracula (1970) and Vampyros Lesbos (1970). She also released numerous Spanish-language pop songs throughout the mid-sixties. She died in a car accident on a Lisbon highway at age 27, in August 1970, just as she was about to sign a new film contract with Franco's producer, Karl Heinz Mannchen." ;

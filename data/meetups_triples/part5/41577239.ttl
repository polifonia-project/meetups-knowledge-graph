Born in Bari, at young age he moved to Milan with his family, following the transfer of his father, a footballer, from A.S. Bari to Calcio Como. In the 1950s Del Prete started his career as a professional dancer. In 1959, he became a close friend and a collaborator of Adriano Celentano. During his tenure with Celentano, Del Prete worked as a lyricist, manager, producer and advisor.

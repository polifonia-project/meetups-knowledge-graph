        mtp:hasAbstract        "Neal Paul Hefti (October 29, 1922 â€“ October 11, 2008) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, and arranger. He wrote music for The Odd Couple movie and TV series and for the Batman TV series. He began arranging professionally in his teens, when he wrote charts for Nat Towles. He composed and arranged while working as a trumpeter for Woody Herman providing the bandleader with versions of \"Woodchopper's Ball\" and \"Blowin' Up a Storm\" and composing \"The Good Earth\" and \"Wild Root\". He left Herman's band in 1946. Now concentrating on writing music only, he began an association with Count Basie in 1950. Hefti occasionally led his own bands." ;

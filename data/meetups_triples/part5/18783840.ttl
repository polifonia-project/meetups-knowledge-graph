        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kendall Steven Chinn (October 19, 1962 â€“ July 16, 2020), known under the stage name Mr. Chi Pig, was a Canadian punk rock vocalist and artist born in Edmonton and long residing in Vancouver. He fronted the hardcore punk band SNFU from 1981 until their hiatus in 2018. Other, short-lived groups that he led included The Wongs, Little Joe, and Slaveco. Chinn was an energetic vocalist, prolific artist, and sardonic lyricist. He was also an early advocate for queer identity in punk rock. His struggles with addiction and mental health problems were well documented, and he died of undisclosed health issues at age 57." ;

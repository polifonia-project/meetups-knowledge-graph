He is known for using a technique of playing fast, intricate lines by using the fingernail of his right index finger in place of a guitar pick. He also had a small role as a member of a band in the film Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. He is currently a member of the group \"Heavy Mellow\" along with founder Benjamin Woods and percussionist Mike Bennett." ;

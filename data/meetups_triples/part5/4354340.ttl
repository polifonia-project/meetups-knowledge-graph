They were chosen to sing the Philippine National Anthem at the Manny Pacquiao vs. Miguel Cotto boxing match in Las Vegas as well as the theme song of Philippine remake of the Mexican telenovela Rosalinda. Following the group's disbandment and her return as a solo artist she released her single \"Help Me Get Over\" which was awarded the 'Song of the Year' at the 6th PMPC Star Awards for Music. In February 2016, Viray ended her decade-long exclusivity with GMA and transferred to ABS-CBN, changing her screen name to 'Jona'.

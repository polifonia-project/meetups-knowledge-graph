        mtp:hasAbstract        "John-Michael Caprio (July 1947 â€“ December 25, 1997) was an American conductor and organist who served as the music director at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City between 1990 and 1997. During his seven years at the renowned Manhattan landmark on Fifth Avenue, he implemented an expanded concert program, worked to enhance the quality of music in liturgical services, and conducted the cathedral's choirs and notable soloists. Caprio arranged and conducted performances televised in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Ireland, along with producing compact disc recordings of the cathedral's choir and organ. Caprio's tenure saw the rebuilding of the cathedral's historic pipe organ and his organization of music for the massive Central Park rally celebrating the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1995. Caprio was also director of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York Music Commission, beginning in 1983. Prior to his appointment at St. Patrick's Cathedral, he founded the Ars Nova Chorale and Orchestra in 1976 and the Riverside Symphonia in 1990." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ghib Ojisan (ジブおじさん; born in 1990), known also as Ghibli Ojisan or Ken, is a Japanese travel YouTuber based in Singapore. His name, Ghib Ojisan, is a pseudonym for his YouTube channel which he chose because he was inspired by Studio Ghibli's animations. Born in Osaka Prefecture in Japan, Ghib Ojisan lived in California between the ages of two and 19 as his parents worked in the state. After graduating from Keio University's Faculty of Environment and Information Studies, he had brief stints at a manufacturing company's personnel and sales departments. In 2017, he quit his job with the goal of traveling the world for a year on a budget of ¥1,000,000 (US$9,112). Ghib Ojisan visited 27 countries and busked with his acoustic guitar, videos of which he uploaded to a YouTube channel he created in 2017. While visiting Singapore, Ghib Ojisan met a Singaporean woman. He later married her and decided to settle in the country. Ghib Ojisan made videos of his experiences living as a Japanese person in Singapore. He made a video about Yishun, which had media coverage indicating it was a dangerous place to live. His video received a large amount of media attention and led to a large increase in YouTube subscribers from outside Japan, which had until then been his primary audience. Ghib Ojisan speaks in Japanese and English in his videos, and includes captions in both languages, with occasional Singlish phrases that contains Mandarin and Malay. He has mostly made videos over aspects of Singaporean culture and history such as hawker centres, the Sembawang Hot Spring Park, Sentosa and the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ghib Ojisan's YouTube channel was among the 10 channels with the highest increase in Singaporean subscribers." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alfred Strombergs (Latvian: Alfrēds Štrombergs; 19 February 1922, in Liepāja, Latvia – 22 February 2006, in Toronto) was a Canadian conductor, music educator, and pianist of Latvian birth. In 1954 he became a naturalized Canadian citizen. As a conductor he is primarily remembered for his work with the Canadian Opera Company and the Stratford Festival from the late 1950s through the early 1970s. He also notably conducted the world premieres of several orchestral works by composer Tālivaldis Ķeniņš, including his fifth and seventh symphonies. As an academic Strombergs wrote and lectured about Canadian art song of the 18th and 19th centuries, and served as a voice teacher and director of opera theatre programs at the Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts (1948-1957), the University of Toronto (1960-1971), and the University of Alberta (1971-1987)." ;

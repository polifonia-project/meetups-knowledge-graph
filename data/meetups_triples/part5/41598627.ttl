        mtp:hasAbstract        "Arin Hanson (born January 6, 1987), also known by the pseudonym Egoraptor, is an American YouTuber, actor, rapper, and animator. He is well-known for his Flash cartoons, as well as being the co-founder and co-star of the popular YouTube Let's Play series Game Grumps. Hanson has created numerous shorts and web series on Newgrounds and YouTube, including The Awesome Series, which parodies video game franchises like Pok√©mon and Metal Gear, and Sequelitis, a series of animated video essays in which he humorously compares a video game and one of its sequels. He has also voice-acted for television and video games. He regularly collaborates with Ninja Sex Party, a musical comedy duo consisting of Game Grumps co-host Dan Avidan and Brian Wecht, with whom he formed the video game-based parody musical trio Starbomb." ;

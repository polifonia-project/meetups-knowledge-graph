Birdsong did not achieve much chart success, but developed a strong fan base, and has also been sampled by other artists many times, most famously by Daft Punk who sampled \"Cola Bottle Baby\" in \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\", and Gang Starr who sampled his single \"Rapper Dapper Snapper\" for their song \"Skills\"." ;

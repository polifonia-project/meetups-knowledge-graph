        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lani Bayot Misalucha (Tagalog pronunciation: [ˈlanɪ mɪsɐˈlutʃa]; born Lani Dimalanta Bayot; August 3, 1969) is a Filipino singer who performs pop, rock, jazz, soul, rhythm and blues, and operatic arias. Her ability to sing across several genres gave her the title \"Asia's Nightingale\" by MTV Southeast Asia. She was also nominated for an Aliw Award for playing Sita in the 1999 Filipino musical Rama at Sita - The Musical. Since arriving in Las Vegas in 2002, Misalucha has been called \"New Siren of the Strip.\" During her stint in Las Vegas, Misalucha performed with the Society of Seven at Bally's Las Vegas and the Flamingo Las Vegas, making her the first Asian to headline in a main showroom at the Las Vegas Strip. She also performed alongside Earl Turner at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino. In March 2008, she was voted the \"Best Singer\" (staff pick) in the \"27th Annual Best of Las Vegas\" poll by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. In 2009, Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman proclaimed December 4 as \"Lani Misalucha Day\" in the city. In 2014, Misalucha returned to the Philippines and signed a recording contract with Star Records, releasing an album entitled The Nightingale Returns." ;

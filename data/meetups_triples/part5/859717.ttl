        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julian Keith Levene (18 July 1957 â€“ 11 November 2022) was an English musician who was a founding member of both the Clash and Public Image Ltd (PiL). While Levene was in PiL, their 1978 debut album Public Image: First Issue reached No 22 in the UK album charts, and its lead track \"Public Image\" broke the top 10 UK singles chart. Levene was born and raised in London, and although initially influenced by progressive rock, his musical taste changed after meeting fellow Clash founder Mick Jones. His punk and post punk guitar sounds have been described as \"both melodic and discordant, sonorous and violent\"." ;

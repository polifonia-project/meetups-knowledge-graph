        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carolyn Abbate (born November 20, 1956) is an American musicologist, described by the Harvard Gazette as \"one of the worldâ€™s most accomplished and admired music historians\".She is currently Paul and Catherine Buttenwieser University Professor at Harvard University. From her earliest essays she has questioned familiar approaches to well-known works, reaching beyond their printed scores and composer intentions, to explore the particular, physical impact of the medium upon performer and audience alike. Her research focuses primarily on the operatic repertory of the 19th century, offering creative and innovative approaches to understanding these works critically and historically. Some of her more recent work has addressed topics such as film studies and performance studies more generally." ;

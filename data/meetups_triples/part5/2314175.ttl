Herron is best known as a founding member of the R&B/pop group En Vogue, one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. She sang lead vocals on the group's first single \"Hold On\", which garnered mainstream success and sold over a million copies. Despite being absent from the group during certain periods, Herron and fellow group member Terry Ellis are the only original members to appear on all of the group's album releases to date. In the 1980s, Herron began her career as an actress, making her debut appearance in Up and Coming as \"Valerie\". She would eventually land roles in more popular TV series including Amen and Full House. She landed a supporting role in the 1986 film release Johnnie Mae Gibson: FBI, and co-starred in Wally and the Valentines as \"Roxanne Valentine\". Throughout her career, Herron has sold a total of over 20 million records with En Vogue.

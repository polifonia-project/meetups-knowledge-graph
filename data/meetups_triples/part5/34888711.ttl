        mtp:hasAbstract        "John S. Carter, Jr. (June 14, 1945 – May 10, 2011), better known as simply Carter, was an American music producer, writer, arranger, instrumentalist, and A&R man. Carter was born the son of an oil wildcatter in East St. Louis, Illinois. His music career began in 1967 when he co-wrote \"That Acapulco Gold\" (a #70 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart) with Tim Gilbert of the Rainy Daze. Also with Gilbert, he co-wrote the lyrics to \"Incense and Peppermints,\" a Billboard #1 hit by the Strawberry Alarm Clock. He first worked for Atlantic Records and was recruited to the A&R department of Capitol Records. There he worked with Bob Seger (fostering his hit album Night Moves) and the Steve Miller Band during the periods of their commercial breakthroughs. He also signed Sammy Hagar, Bob Welch and The Motels to Capitol, and co-wrote and produced some of their early output. Carter is credited with relaunching the career of Tina Turner in the 1980s. In 1983, despite opposition from within Capitol, Carter signed Turner and supported her throughout the recording of her first Capitol album, Private Dancer—an album that ultimately involved eight different producers. Though many producers contributed to the album, it was Carter who produced the title song. The album went on to sell more than 20 million copies and made Turner a global superstar. He died of cancer on May 10, 2011 in Palm Springs, California. Carter had a daughter in 1980 with his wife Jeannie named Crosby Carter. She followed in his footsteps and became an artist manager." ;

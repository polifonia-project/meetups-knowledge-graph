His music is defined as Latin trap and reggaeton. He rose to popularity in 2016 with his song \"Diles\", which led to a deal with Hear This Music. He continued gaining traction with songs such as \"Soy Peor\" and collaborations with Farruko, Karol G, Ozuna, J Balvin, and more during the next few years. His breakthrough came in 2018 with his feature on Cardi B's hit song \"I Like It\" alongside J Balvin, and his song \"Mia\" featuring Drake. His debut album X 100pre released in December 2018 through Rimas Entertainment, which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard 200. He then released his collaborative album Oasis with J Balvin in June 2019, reaching number 9 on the Billboard Global 200. Bad Bunny's second solo album YHLQMDLG released on February 29, 2020 and became the highest charting all-Spanish album, reaching number two on Billboard. It was followed up with the compilation Las que no iban a salir in May. In November, he released his fourth album El Último Tour Del Mundo, combining his reggaeton and Latin trap sound with rock music. The album became the first all-Spanish-language album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. In May 2022, his fifth album Un Verano Sin Ti released, becoming his second number-one U.S. album.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Arthur Ivan Allin (3 December 1847 â€“ 31 January 1926) was a Danish violinist, organist, conductor and composer. Arthur Allin has never specialized himself as a musician. As his interests have been many-sided, his field of work has been extensive, more so presumably than he dreamed when he, as a 12-year-old boy, stepped into Tivoli Gardens and beat the little drum in \"Old Lumbye's\" orchestra. Arthur Ivan Allin was born in Copenhagen, Denmark 3 December 1847. In the days of his childhood he had music instructions from Adolf Hartmann (piano), Valdemar Tofte (violin), and Peter Rasmussen (theory)." ;

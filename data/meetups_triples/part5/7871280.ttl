        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michaël Borremans (born 1963) is a Belgian painter and filmmaker who lives and works in Ghent. His painting technique draws on 18th-century art as well as the works of Édouard Manet and Degas. The artist also cites the Spanish court painter Diego Velázquez as an important influence. In recent years, he has been using photographs he has made himself or made-to-order sculptures as the basis for his paintings. Borremans figured peripherally in a 2022 Balenciaga campaign that was accused of promoting child abuse; following this, his painting series Fire from the Sun (2018) attracted criticism on Twitter for containing disturbing images of children." ;

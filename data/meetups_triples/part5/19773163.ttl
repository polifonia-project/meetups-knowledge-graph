        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dave Jones, better known as Zed Bias, is an English electronic musician based in Manchester, who operates within the UK garage/2-step, broken beat and UK funky genres, as a producer and as a DJ. He has also released material under various pseudonyms including Maddslinky and is half of the Phuturistix duo. Bias is best known for his single \"Neighbourhood\" which reached #25 in the UK charts in July 2000, having created a large underground response from late 1999 in its original version. Living in Milton Keynes at the time, he collaborated with several other local artists and DJs resulting in a host of well-received tracks and remixes early in his producing career, such as \"Standard Hoodlum Issue\" with DJ Spatts (The Criminal Minds). Some of these have been released on his own Sidewinder/Sidestepper and Biasonic labels. Bias started to record under the Maddslinky name in 2001, resulting in the album \"Make Your Peace\" in 2003 and a second \"Make A Change\" in 2010. Around the same time, he also became one half of the production duo Phuturistix and has been engaged in remixing duties for many well-known artists. Bias' releases, which explore a more experimental or progressive side of the 2-step garage sound, have been hailed as a crucial element in the establishment of dubstep as a definable sound or genre." ;

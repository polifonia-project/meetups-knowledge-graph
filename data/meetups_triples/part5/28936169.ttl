Powell was a member of the writing and production house, Xenomania, for fourteen years. His first hit \"All I Wanna Do\" for Dannii Minogue peaked at number four in the UK Singles Chart in 1997. In his fourteen years at Xenomania, Powell contributed to hit records such as \"Hole in the Head\" and \"Round Round\" by Sugababes, \"Call the Shots\" by Girls Aloud and \"Love etc.\" by Pet Shop Boys. In March 2010, Powell split from Xenomania to become an independent songwriter and producer. Following his departure, Powell co-wrote \"I'm in Love\" by Alex Gaudino and co-wrote and produced Ed Drewett's debut single \"Champagne Lemonade\", released in October 2010. Powell collaborated again with Pet Shop Boys co-writing and producing their single, \"Together\", which features on their album Ultimate. 2012 saw Powell work and share writing and/or production credits with Paloma Faith's,\"Picking Up the Pieces\" (co-write), Saint Etienne for their album \"Words & Music\", Jess Mills single \"For My Sins\" and the third track on Little Mix's debut album DNA, \"Change Your Life\", released on 19 November 2012.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alejandra Ghersi Rodríguez (born 14 October 1989), known professionally as Arca, is a Venezuelan musician and record producer based in Barcelona, Spain. First becoming famous in Venezuela, she initially began releasing music under the name of Nuuro and was praised by Los Amigos Invisibles. Noted for her experimental music, after attending and graduating the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Ghersi first released the EP Baron Libre (2012) under the name Arca and subsequently released the EPs Stretch 1 and Stretch 2, the latter of which she experimented with hip hop music. In 2013, she received credit for being an additional producer, programmer and consultant for American rapper Kanye West's album Yeezus and as a producer on all the tracks featured on British musician FKA Twigs' EP EP2 (2013). She further released experimental music with her first two albums, Xen and Mutant, in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Ghersi's production was also featured prominently on Icelandic musician Björk's studio album Vulnicura (2015). Her eponymous third album, Arca (2017), became the first to prominently feature her vocals. From 2020-2021, Ghersi released the Kick quintet, starting with the album Kick I (2020) and ending with Kick IIIII (2021), the former of which was noted for its foray into avant-pop. She has additionally contributed production work to artists such as Kelela, and has worked with artists such as The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, Planningtorock, Rosalía and Sia. Ghersi frequently incorporated themes of being non-binary after coming out in 2018, with the single \"Nonbinary\" discussing her feelings about the subject. She also chronicles themes of gender identity and psychosexuality into her music. Ghersi's music as Arca has also been known for sampling genres such as alternative reggaeton and IDM." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ilya Nikkolai (born 25 September 1939 in Kiev, Ukraine) is an Australian visual music artist and architectural designer currently residing in Perth, Western Australia. Nikkolai is known for what he calls \"Liquid Music,\" which has been broadcast in Australia (Channel 31 (Australia), Melbourne and Perth and CTV Perth) and America (Harmony Channel) and on Floating Worlds [1], a channel featured on Joost. George Borzyskowski, prominent computer filmmaker and Head of the School of Design at Curtin University, Western Australia, wrote of Ilya’s work: “His energy and dedication, together with his unique and consistent investigative methodology, applied to the exploration of acoustic and visual phenomena within the context of contemporary time based audio visual media technologies, has resulted in a remarkable and highly significant body of creative production. From my own experience I see direct evolutionary relevance in his work to that of previous experimental media artists such as abstract expressionist film maker Oskar Fischinger, Len Lye, some of the work of Norman McLaren, Jordan Belson and others. Ilya Nikkolai’s work in moving forward is informed by an awareness of current research in allied fields together with an appreciation of the demands of today’s critical audiences, as well as his responsibility as an artist to challenge those demands with new experiences and insights.”" ;

She came to prominence in the late 1980s as a solo artist, and released six singles that entered the UK Singles Chart during the 1980s and 1990s. Her solo singles, sometimes dealing with lost love, include \"Stop!\", \"This Feeling\", \"Can I Get a Witness\", \"Kissing Gate\", \"With a Little Love\" and \"Just Good Friends\". She worked as a session backing vocalist, working with artists such as Gary Moore, George Harrison, Small Faces, Spandau Ballet, Adam Ant, Jon Lord (of Deep Purple), Pink Floyd (also David Gilmour), The Firm, Dodgy and Nick Cave. Brown released her debut album Stop! in 1988.

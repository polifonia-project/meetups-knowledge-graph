He was a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and co-wrote many of the band's hits with Petty, including \"Refugee\", \"Here Comes My Girl\", \"You Got Lucky\", and \"Runnin' Down a Dream\". Outside of The Heartbreakers, he has worked as a session guitarist and songwriter with a number of other acts, including composing and playing on the Don Henley hit \"The Boys of Summer\", as well as working on most of Stevie Nicks's solo albums. Campbell, along with Neil Finn, joined Fleetwood Mac to replace lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on their world tour in 2018â€“2019. After the end of that tour he has been involved in his own band, The Dirty Knobs, and has released 2 albums, as of 2022. On November 11, 2011, Rolling Stone magazine named Mike Campbell to their top 100 guitarists coming in at number 79.

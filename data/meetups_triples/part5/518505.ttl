        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charley Patton (April 1891 (probable) â€“ April 28, 1934), also known as Charlie Patton, was an American Delta blues musician and songwriter. Considered by many to be the \"Father of the Delta Blues\", he created an enduring body of American music and inspired most Delta blues musicians. The musicologist Robert Palmer considered him one of the most important American musicians of the twentieth century. Patton (who was well educated by the standards of his time) spelled his name Charlie, but many sources, including record labels and his gravestone, use the spelling Charley." ;

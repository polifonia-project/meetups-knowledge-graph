Krieger wrote or co-wrote many of the Doors' songs, including the hits \"Light My Fire\", \"Love Me Two Times\", \"Touch Me\", and \"Love Her Madly\". When the Doors disbanded following the death of lead singer Jim Morrison, Krieger continued to perform and record with other musicians including former Doors bandmates John Densmore and Ray Manzarek. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Doors and is listed by Rolling Stone as one of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Czesława Gospodarek (née Cieślak; 10 June 1938 – 5 December 2011), known by her stage name Violetta Villas, was a Polish and international cabaret star, singer, actress, composer and songwriter. Her voice was characterized as coloratura soprano, which spanned over four octaves. She could play the piano, violin, and trombone and had absolute pitch. Characterisations of her included \"the voice of the atomic age\", \"the singing toast of the continent\", \"a voice like French champagne\", and the \"Polish Yma Sumac\". Villas was the first star of the Casino de Paris at Dunes Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas (1966–1970). Villas was known for her conspicuous wardrobe and number-one hits. During her show business career, Villas acted in six films, performed in numerous musical shows, and recorded almost three hundred songs in ten languages, including Polish, English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Neapolitan, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese. She was an animal rights activist. In 2011, Villas received the Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis." ;

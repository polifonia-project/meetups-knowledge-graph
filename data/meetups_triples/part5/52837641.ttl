        mtp:hasAbstract        "Henry Qualls (July 8, 1934 â€“ December 7, 2003) was an American Texas and country blues guitarist and singer. He found success late in his life after being \"discovered\" in 1993 by the Dallas Blues Society. He released his only album in 1994 but toured globally playing at a number of festivals. The Dallas Observer noted that \"Qualls, whether unearthing obscurities from Jimmy Reed or Lowell Fulson or Blind Willie Johnson or bearing down upon his own material, is a purist's dream-come-true, attacking his 36 year-old guitar with a demon-fire ferociousness first heard in the playing of Son House and other blues masters long gone to hell.\"" ;

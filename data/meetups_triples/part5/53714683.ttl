She rose to prominence in the 2010s as a member of the girl group Little Mix, one of the world's best-selling girl groups ever. With Little Mix, she released six studio albums and achieved five number-one singles on the UK Singles Chart. While in Little Mix, Pinnock released her documentary Leigh-Anne: Race, Pop & Power (2021), which was met with critical acclaim. At the 26th National Television Awards, it received a nomination for \"Best Authored Documentary\". In the same year, she made her acting debut in the film Boxing Day, which became the first British festive rom-com to be led by an all-black cast. Besides music, she is also known for her activism in fighting against racism and in 2020, she won the Equality Award in recognition for her work towards racial equality in the UK." ;

He first gained popularity in the late 90s for his second Lok Pop album Parivesh Vol.2 with all time hit songs like Mutu Chune, Bhote Talcha, Haat Ma Rumal and Chaite Dashain, and was dubbed as pioneer of Lok Pop genre in Nepalese music industry. Pioneer of folk pop music in Nepal, from Pokhara, family of Martyr Thir Bam Malla, has sung dozens of hit Nepali pop songs and those songs are still playing in Nepali youth's heart. As a member of martyr family, nobody in his family had interest in music, singing or dancing, but as a contrary to this environment, Tilak Bam Malla had a keen interest in music, which grew with his age. Though there was no apparent career opportunity in music industry, during that time, he decided to step in and followed his passion in music. In addition to acting, Malla is a humanitarian and has participated and spoken out for various social causes, especially during devastating earthquake of Nepal in 2015 and aftermath. He was also awarded by various honors and awards for contributing in the field of social work and welfare acts." ;

She is often regarded as one of the greatest female rappers of her generation, as well as being one of the most influential rappers of all time. Minaj first gained recognition after releasing three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009. She is known for her musical versatility, animated flow in her rapping, alter egos and accents. She is also credited with the revival of female rap in the mainstream. Her debut album, Pink Friday (2010), topped the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. Its fifth single, \"Super Bass\", reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and was certified diamond by the RIAA. Minaj's follow-up album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012) explored dance-pop. The lead single, \"Starships\", peaked in the top five worldwide. Her third album, The Pinkprint (2014) explored more personal topics and marked a return to her hip hop roots. Its second single, \"Anaconda\" debuted at number two on the hot 100 and became the first music video by a solo female rapper to reach one billion views on YouTube. She released her fourth album, Queen, in 2018 and it spawned the U.S. top ten single “Chun-Li”. In 2019, her collaboration with Karol G, \"Tusa\", became the longest-running number-one single on the Argentina Hot 100 chart. The lead single of her forthcoming fifth studio album, \"Super Freaky Girl\" became the second solo song by a female rapper to debut at number one in the U.S. Minaj also has achieved a string of chart topping hits as a featured artist including “Bang Bang”, “Fefe”, “Trollz”, and “Say So”. Referred to as the \"Queen of Rap\", Minaj is also one of the world’s best-selling music artists, with more than 100 million records sold worldwide.

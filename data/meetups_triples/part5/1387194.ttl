        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roger Henry Brough Whittaker (born 22 March 1936) is a British singer-songwriter and musician, who was born in Nairobi to English parents. His music is an eclectic mix of folk music and popular songs in addition to radio airplay hits. He is best known for his baritone singing voice and trademark whistling ability as well as his guitar skills. He is widely known for his version of \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" (1982), as well as his own compositions \"Durham Town (The Leavin')\" (1969) and \"I Don't Believe in If Anymore\" (1970). American audiences are most familiar with his 1970 hit \"New World in the Morning\" and his 1975 hit \"The Last Farewell\", which is his only single to hit the Billboard Hot 100 (it made the Top 20) and also hit No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. He is also known for his renditions of \"Ding! Dong! Merrily on High\" and \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\". His final top-charting hit was \"Albany\", which scored No. 3 in West Germany in 1982." ;

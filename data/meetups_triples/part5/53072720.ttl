She was born in Moscow and made her debut as a conductor in Leningrad, now is known as St. Petersburg, while still a student. In 1976 she emigrated to Israel. She had conducted performances of the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and according to Gramophone was \"one of the few Russian women to have made a successful international career as a conductor.\" At the time of her death she was the emeritus director of the El Camino Youth Orchestra." ;

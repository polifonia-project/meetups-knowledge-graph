        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Lawrence Thorogood (born February 24, 1950) is an American musician, singer and songwriter from Wilmington, Delaware. His \"high-energy boogie-blues\" sound became a staple of 1980s rock radio, with hits like his original songs \"Bad to the Bone\" and \"I Drink Alone\". He has also helped to popularize older songs by American icons, such as \"Move It on Over\", \"Who Do You Love?\", and \"House Rent Blues/One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\". With his band, the Delaware Destroyers, Thorogood has released over 20 albums, two of which have been certified Platinum and six have been certified Gold. He has sold 15 million records worldwide. Thorogood and his band continue to tour extensively and in 2014 the band celebrated their 40th anniversary of performing." ;

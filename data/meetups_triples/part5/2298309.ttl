        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stephen Carlton Wright (20 December 1947 – 27 December 2015) was an Australian musician and songwriter who has been called Australia's first international pop star. During 1964–69, he was lead singer of Sydney-based rock and roll band the Easybeats, widely regarded as the greatest Australian pop band of the 1960s. Early hits for the Easybeats were co-written by Wright with bandmate George Young, including: \"She's So Fine\" (No. 3, 1965), \"Wedding Ring\" (No. 7, 1965), \"Women (Make You Feel Alright)\" (No. 4, 1966), \"Come and See Her\" (No. 3, 1966), \"I'll Make You Happy\" (track on Easyfever EP, No. 1, 1966), and \"Sorry\" (No. 1, 1966). He was lead vocalist on their only international hit, \"Friday on My Mind\", which peaked at No. 1 in Australia in 1966. It also made No. 6 in the United Kingdom, the Top 10 in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, No.13 in Canada, and the Top 20 in the United States in 1967. After the Easybeats disbanded in 1969, Wright fronted numerous groups including Stevie Wright Band and Stevie Wright & the Allstars; his solo career included the 1974 single, \"Evie (Parts 1, 2 & 3)\", which peaked at No. 1 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Wright had problems with alcohol and drug addictions. By 1976 he was hospitalised and undertook methadone treatment. In the late 1970s he was treated at Chelmsford Private Hospital by Harry Bailey who administered deep sleep therapy with a combination of drug-induced coma and electroshock. Wright's life was detailed in two biographies, Sorry: The Wretched Tale of Little Stevie Wright by Jack Marx (1999) and Hard Road: The Life and Times of Stevie Wright by Glenn Goldsmith (2004). On 14 July 2005, the Easybeats, with Wright as a member, were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame." ;

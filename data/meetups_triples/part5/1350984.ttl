He also performed with John Cale (2013). Thomas joined Bolt Thrower on 21 August 1997. He played drums on Mercenary and the Into The Killing Zone tour, then left the band in 2000 due to lack of interest in the musical direction that Bolt Thrower were taking. He has also played with Badly Drawn Boy, Groop Dogdrill, New Young Pony Club, UNKLE, Saint Etienne, Bat for Lashes, played guitar with Fridge and, under the name Earl Shilton, he has released the album Two Rooms (Full of Insects) on the Invisible Spies record label.

Trained as a classical pianist, Eça created a formal, but stunning approach to bossa nova classics such as \"The Hill\" by Antonio Carlos Jobim and works by Edu Lobo. His song \"The Dolphin\" is considered a jazz standard and has been recorded by Stan Getz, Bill Evans, and Denny Zeitlin. The Tamba 4 group included Otávio Bailly, who replaced Bebeto." ;

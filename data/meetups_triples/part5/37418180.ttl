        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alma Elizabeth Deutscher (born 19 February 2005) is a British composer, pianist and violinist. A child prodigy, Deutscher composed her first piano sonata at the age of five. At seven, she completed the short opera, The Sweeper of Dreams. Aged nine, she wrote a violin concerto. At the age of ten, she wrote her first full-length opera, Cinderella, which had its European premiere in Vienna in 2016 under the patronage of conductor Zubin Mehta, and its U.S. premiere a year later. Deutscher's piano concerto was premiered when she was 12. She has lived in Vienna, Austria since 2018. She made her debut at Carnegie Hall in 2019 in a concert dedicated to her own composition." ;

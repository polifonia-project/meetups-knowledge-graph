        mtp:hasAbstract        "Boyd Gilmore (June 1, 1905 or June 12, 1910 â€“ December 23, 1976) was an American Delta blues singer, guitarist and songwriter. Among the songs he wrote were \"All in My Dreams\", \"Believe I'll Settle Down\", \"I Love My Little Woman\" and \"If That's Your Girl\". Gilmore also recorded a version of fellow Delta bluesman Robert Johnson's track, \"Ramblin' on My Mind\". He could play guitar, although there is no recorded evidence of his work on that instrument. According to AllMusic, he was \"an exuberant singer\"." ;

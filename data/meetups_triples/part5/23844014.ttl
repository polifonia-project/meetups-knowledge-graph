        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donna Loren is an American singer and actress. A prolific performer in the 1960s, she was the \"Dr Pepper Girl\" from 1963 to 1968, featured female vocalist on Shindig, and a cast member of the American International Pictures Beach Party movie franchise. She was signed to Capitol Records in 1964, releasing several singles and the Beach Blanket Bingo LP soundtrack, which included her signature song \"It Only Hurts When I Cry\". Loren guest-starred on episodic television series including Dr. Kildare, Batman, and The Monkees, as well as appeared regularly on network and local variety and music shows. In 1968, Loren retired from her career to marry and raise a family. She recorded again in the 1980s and ran her own fashion business, ADASA Hawaii, throughout the 1990-2000s. In 2009, she returned to performing, and her most recent releases include the album Love It Away (2010) and the EP Donna Does Elvis in Hawaii (2010), as well as the compilation These Are the Good Times: The Complete Capitol Recordings (2014). Her first book, Pop Sixties: Shindig!, Dick Clark, Beach Party, and Photographs from the Donna Loren Archive, was released in 2017. In August, 2020, Loren began hosting Love's A Secret Weapon Podcast, an audio memoir of her life and career." ;

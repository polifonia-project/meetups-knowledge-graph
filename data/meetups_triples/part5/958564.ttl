        mtp:hasAbstract        "Muslimgauze was the main musical project of Bryn Jones (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British ethnic electronica and experimental musician who was influenced by conflicts and history in the Muslim world, often with an emphasis on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never achieved mainstream success. His music has been described by one critic as \"among the most startling and unique in the noise underground.\" The name Muslimgauze is a play on the word muslin (a type of gauze) combined with Muslim, referring to Jones' preoccupation with conflicts throughout the Muslim world." ;

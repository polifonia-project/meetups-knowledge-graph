        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ashley McBryde (born July 29, 1983) is an American country music singerâ€“songwriter. Raised in Arkansas, she was drawn to various types of music from a young age. She also developed a passion for writing songs and later moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a music career. Between 2006 and 2011, McBryde released a pair of self-released albums. Her 2016 extended play (EP) titled Jalopies & Expensive Guitars drew attention from country artist Eric Church. His support helped her gain a country music recording contract with Warner Music Nashville. In 2017, the label released her debut single \"A Little Dive Bar in Dahlonega\". The song was followed by her corresponding studio release Girl Going Nowhere (2018). Both the album and the single received critical acclaim and led to recognition from several music associations. It was followed by 2019's Never Will, which was also met with critical acclaim. Its lead single \"One Night Standards\" reached the top 20 of the American country songs chart and topped the Canadian country survey. A four-time Grammy Award nominee, McBryde has also received one Country Music Association Award, three Academy of Country Music Awards and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy. She earned one of country music's crowning achievements when she was invited to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry by Garth Brooks on October 6, 2022." ;

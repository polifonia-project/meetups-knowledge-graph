        mtp:hasAbstract        "Betty Marion White (January 17, 1922 – December 31, 2021) was an American actress and comedian. A pioneer of early television, with a television career spanning almost seven decades, White was noted for her vast work in the entertainment industry and being one of the first women to work both in front of and behind the camera. She was the first woman to produce a sitcom, Life with Elizabeth (1953–1955). After making the transition from radio to television, White became a staple panelist of American game shows, including Password, Match Game, Tattletales, To Tell the Truth, The Hollywood Squares, and The $25,000 Pyramid. Dubbed \"the first lady of game shows\", White became the first woman to receive the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host for the show Just Men! in 1983. She was also known for her appearances on The Bold and the Beautiful, Boston Legal, and The Carol Burnett Show. Her biggest roles include Sue Ann Nivens on the CBS sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1973–1977), Rose Nylund on the NBC sitcom The Golden Girls (1985–1992), and Elka Ostrovsky on the TV Land sitcom Hot in Cleveland (2010–2015). She gained a renewed career resurgence with her role in the romantic comedy film The Proposal (2009). She then hosted Saturday Night Live in 2010, garnering her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. She was the subject of the 2018 documentary, Betty White: First Lady of Television which detailed her life and career. White earned a Guinness World Record for \"Longest TV career by an entertainer (female)\" in 2014 and in 2018 for her lengthy work in radio, television, and film. White received various awards including five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Daytime Emmy Awards, and a Regional Emmy Award as well as three American Comedy Awards, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Grammy Award.

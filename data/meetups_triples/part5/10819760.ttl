        mtp:hasAbstract        "Diane Peoples Waldrop (née Ray; September 1, 1945 – March 14, 2020) was an American pop and rock and roll singer of the early 1960s. Ray was born in Gastonia, North Carolina. Her musical career began after she won a talent contest on Big WAYS radio in Charlotte NC. She is best known for her hit single, \"Please Don't Talk to the Lifeguard\", which reached #31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1963. Without any further chart presence, Ray remains a one-hit wonder. Diane Ray Waldrop died on March 14, 2020 at the age of 74." ;

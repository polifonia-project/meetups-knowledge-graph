In 2004, he participated in the tribute album for Yutaka Ozaki (尾崎豊) under his full name Shunsuke Kiyokiba as a solo artist. On January 19, 2005, his solo debut single \"Itsuka...\" (いつか…) was released. After four-and-a-half years with Exile, in March 2006, Kiyokiba announced his withdrawal from the group to focus on his solo career as a rock artist. In July 2011, he recorded the duet \"I Believe\" with South Korean singer Shin Hye-sung of Shinhwa." ;

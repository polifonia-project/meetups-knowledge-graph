From 1966 to 1991, Brandon played in various bands across the United States. He joined Highway 61 in 1991, and recorded four albums in that ensemble until their break-up in 2001. In 1994 he formed the Prime Rib Blues Band. Popular Skeeter Brandon songs include \"Strollie Bun\", \"That's What Lovin You Has Done To Me\", \"Soap Opera Blues\", and \"The Last Goodby\". Brandon's lifetime in music reflected the influence of the African-American songster tradition." ;

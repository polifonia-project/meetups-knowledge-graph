She topped the Billboard charts with the No. 1 singles \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\", \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\", \"Feel Like Makin' Love\", \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\", the latter two duets with Donny Hathaway. Flack is also noted for her influence on the subgenre of contemporary R&B called quiet storm, along with her interpretations of songs by various songwriters, such as Leonard Cohen and members of the Beatles. Flack was the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in two consecutive years: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" won in 1973 and \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\" won in 1974." ;

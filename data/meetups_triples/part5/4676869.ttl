        mtp:hasAbstract        "Björn Tom Fredrik Nordström (born 5 January 1967) is a Swedish musician and record producer, best known as the guitarist of heavy metal band Dream Evil. Nordström is one of the leading melodic death metal and power metal producers in Sweden and has worked with some of said genres' top acts, including At the Gates, Arch Enemy, Nightrage, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Soilwork, Opeth, and Powerwolf. Fascinated by technology from a young age, Nordström opened a small recording studio in Gothenburg, mainly to record his own music. The studio evolved into Studio Fredman, one of the leading Swedish recording studios where he works with his employee Henrik Udd. In 1999, Nordström formed the heavy metal band Dream Evil to perform his own music, and as of 2010, Dream Evil has released five albums, one live DVD/CD set, and two EPs. Today, Nordström is considered one of the top metal producers in Europe, and one of the central figures of the Gothenburg style." ;

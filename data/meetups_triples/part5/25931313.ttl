        mtp:hasAbstract        "Torrey Carter (nicknamed T.C.) (born April 15, 1980) is an American R&B singer. He gained popularity after signing to Missy Elliott's The Goldmind Inc. as the first male artist under the label. There, he began recording for his debut album, The Life I Live, which was led by the single \"Take That\" (US #87; US R&B No. 14). However, due to the lack of mainstream success with the lead single, the album was shelved and he departed from Goldmind. In 2006, Carter co-wrote and helped produce Nina Sky's song, \"Building a Vibe\". Footage of the recording leaked via YouTube that same year. By 2007, Carter's MySpace singles (\"Pause\" and \"Get It Girl\") had accumulated enough buzz for him to prepare a possible album, however the idea was scrapped and Carter went on to embark on other musical opportunities. He has been recently featured in hip-hop producer Shawneci's recent mixtapes, Icecold Collection (Vol. 1â€“2). On September 25, 2012, Carter released the R&B womanizing-themed \"ReBirth\" via iTunes and Amazon. In November 2012, a music video for the single leaked via YouTube and had accumulated over 50,000 views in just one month; however, due to undisclosed reasons the video was removed and has since then been re-uploaded. In December 2017, Carter was arrested on drug charges in Grand Rapids, Michigan." ;

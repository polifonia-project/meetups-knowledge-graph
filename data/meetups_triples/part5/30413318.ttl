        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeppe Breum Laursen is a Danish singer-songwriter and producer. Performing under the name \"Senior\", Laursen was the lead vocalist of the pop duo Junior Senior. In 2008 the British magazine Dazed & Confused praised Laursen's music for its \"urgency and club appeal\" and described it as \"industrial synth-pop and bone-rattling drama\". His first solo release was a collaboration with American electronic music duo Classixx entitled \"I'll Get You\", which was released in 2009 on Kitsun√©. Laursen's song \"Lucky Boy\" was a contender for Denmark's entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest. Laursen also remixed \"Off Our Backs\" by American electropop band MEN in 2010. Laursen co-wrote and co-produced Lady Gaga's 2011 single \"Born This Way\", the title track from her second studio album of the same name. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on 16 February 2011." ;

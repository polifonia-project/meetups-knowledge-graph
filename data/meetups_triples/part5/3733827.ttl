He was born in Barnet, Hertfordshire. Self-taught on guitar, Miller formed his first band, Delivery, at age 17, which backed blues musicians playing at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London. In the 1970s he was a founding member of Matching Mole, Hatfield and the North and National Health. In later years he was a member of Short Wave (with Hugh Hopper, Pip Pyle, and Didier Malherbe), and In Cahoots with Richard Sinclair, Elton Dean, Peter Lemer, and Pip Pyle. In 2005 and 2006, Miller toured with a re-united Hatfield and the North. Miller also performed and recorded extensively in solo projects. Miller died on 18 October 2017 in London from cancer." ;

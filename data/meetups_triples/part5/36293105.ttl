        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Keith Pitman (February 12, 1920 â€“ August 11, 2022) was an American guitarist and session musician. As a first-call studio musician working in Los Angeles, Pitman played on some of the most celebrated and influential records of the rock and roll era. His mastery of the guitar placed him in high demand for popular music recordings, television programs, and film scores. The style and range of his playing covered a wide spectrum, from the distinctive ukulele in the Academy Award-winning song \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\", to a rich-sounding Danelectro guitar that gave The Wild Wild West its unique musical signature." ;

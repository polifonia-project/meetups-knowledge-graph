He has released several albums on his label planetcoffeebean, and in 2010 was nominated for Independent Artist of the Year at the Palm Beach Hip Hop Awards. His most recent album, The Local Cafe, was released in 2017, with the music video for the track \"Railroads Down/Unfished\" released to MTV2 and MTV Jams in April 2014. He has released several other music videos as well. BET wrote that Biddines' music \"demonstrates a Dungeon Family-like propensity for interweaving harmonious refrains into complex flows to create a sound that sandwiches pure hip hop with layerings of funk and R&B.\"" ;

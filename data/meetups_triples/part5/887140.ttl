        mtp:hasAbstract        "Albert Lancaster Lloyd (29 February 1908 â€“ 29 September 1982), usually known as A. L. Lloyd or Bert Lloyd, was an English folk singer and collector of folk songs, and as such was a key figure in the British folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s. While Lloyd is most widely known for his work with British folk music, he had a keen interest in the music of Spain, Latin America, Southeastern Europe and Australia. He recorded at least six discs of Australian Bush ballads and folk music. Lloyd also helped establish the folk music subgenre of industrial folk music through his books, recordings, collecting and theoretical writings." ;

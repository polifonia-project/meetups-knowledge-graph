He is known as \"The king of hearts\" and \"The legend of pop\" in Iran. He graduated from Tehran Industrial School of Art in 1958. Before starting his career as a singer, Aref worked as a teacher in Qazvin industrial school of art for two years, but the truth is that he has been singing since he was 12 years old. In the 1960s, Aref introduced a new wave of romantic styles to the large spectrum of romantic Persian music. After the Islamic revolution Aref left Iran and went to London and Los Angeles. He has one son and four daughters. His first hit was \" which is still popular among all the Iranians. Aref and his family left Iran in 1979, following the Islamic revolution.

Song Style: In the past, Aref's work was known among music pursuers as \"Aref style.\". The process of shaping this style was as follows:In the mid-1940s, songs were performed as ballads that had Arabic themes and were mostly needles and gloomy. The course was attended by singers Qasim Jebeli, Manouchehr Shafiee, Alfred Lazarian and Houshang Shokati. Some poets and translators translated the lyrics of the European song \"Wow to Wow\". Hamid Ghanbari and Jamshid Sheibani were among the first to perform the translated lyrics with the same original song. This style was pop, but it was not Iranian. In the early 1950s, love songs were performed with Western orchestration and Persian theology. This style of songs was presented to the public by Mohammad Noori, Vigen and Manouchehr Sakhaei. When Aref started his career, Viguen was referred to as the \"founder of pop music\". He was able to create a \"Aref style\" by adding Iranian melodies and musical instruments to the previous style. The concept of songs : Love Songs Aref had suffered many hardships in his life, so there was a \"disdain\" in his voice. His loneliness also made the songs he sang more palpable to the listener, and the sense of the song conveyed well.

(Aref never used smoke or alcohol) Shahbal Shab-pareh wrote in \"The Pop Fader song\" about Aref: \"The Sultan(=King) of Hearts was Aref, reading it was for the heart of love.

New Persian Songs : In the early 1970s, great songwriters such as Shahyar Ghanbari, Ardalan Sarfaraz and Iraj Jannati-Ataei began to change the course of songs and used heavy Persian literature. These types of poets were like unknown 2-3 equations that led the listener astray. Aref sought to perform simple poets that would be tangible to the listener. Like the song \"\" with a poem by Shahyar Ghanbari that was performed in the mid-1960s : [ I know, like everyone else, you'll be fed up with me, and you'll be saddened by my grief / These two white hands in my hand, I know, will eventually put my hand back / I know, but I don't believe it's enough that it's simple, it brings me bad back ] Polyphony Songs : 1.

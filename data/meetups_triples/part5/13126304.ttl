In 1997 she majored in Jazz Performance at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. There she met mandolin player Billy Bright and guitarist Brian Smith, with whom she formed the Two High String Band. In 1997, Bryn began working with Peter Rowan as the Texas Trio, which toured the US and eventually would become the Peter Rowan & Tony Rice Quartet. In 2004 Davies moved to Nashville, Tennessee. From January to August 2007 she worked with Patty Griffin on the Children Running Through tour. Davies has an extensive discography, and has recorded with Guy Clark, The Peter Rowan & Tony Rice Quartet, Old and & In the Way, and Don Edwards. She has toured with Marty Stuart, The Tony Rice Unit, Darrell Scott, Guy Clark, Steve Earle, Jim Lauderdale and Shawn Camp. Along with her many studio and side projects, Davies currently tours with Darrell Scott, The Tony Rice Unit, Jack White and Scott Miller.

As of 2020 she is employed as a safety engineer at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and continues to play bass as a sideline to her new career instead of as a full-time profession.[1]" ;

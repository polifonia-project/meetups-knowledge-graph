Based in New York City and signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation label, his musical style has been dubbed by Roc Nation as \"gangsta-rock\". He is best known for his bluegrass re-working of Jay-Z's \"99 Problems\". His debut album, Old Tyme Religion, was released on 10 May 2011. He can trace direct royal heritage back from his maternal great-grandfather, Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath, a son of King Rama V of Thailand, and is a second cousin once removed of the King of Thailand, King Vajiralongkorn." ;

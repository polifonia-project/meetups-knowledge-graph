        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elizabeth Abrams, better known as Liz (stylized as LIZ) or Liz Y2K, is an American singer and actress from Tarzana, Los Angeles, California. Her music is described by herself as \"Sailor Moon R&B\" and \"future pop\". and her music has been continuously stated to be \"unapologetically pop\" sounding. Liz gained more attention in 2015 when she released a single, made with producer Sophie, called \"When I Rule the World\" which first appeared in a Samsung commercial. She is additionally recognized for her late 1990s/early 2000s influence which is prevalent in both her music and fashion. The \"Y2K\" in her social media handles is in reference to this." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Deacon John Moore (born June 23, 1941, New Orleans, Louisiana) better known as Deacon John, is a blues, rhythm and blues and rock and roll musician, singer, actor, and bandleader. John Moore was given the name \"Deacon\" by one of his band members. He did not like the name at first as he thought everyone would assume he was a gospel singer and never get gigs. However, based upon his early reputation, and at the urging of a music promoter, he decided to keep it as has been \"Deacon John\" ever since." ;

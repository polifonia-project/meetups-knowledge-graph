        mtp:hasAbstract        "Blue Barron (November 19, 1913 â€“ July 16, 2005), born Harry Freidman, was an American orchestra leader in the 1940s and early 1950s during the Big Band era. His band's more subdued tone was referred to as \"Sweet\" music to distinguish it from the \"Swing\" bands of the era. Barron's orchestra began in the New York City area but later toured the U.S. and performed at popular venues in Los Angeles where they also appeared in several motion pictures and recorded a number of LPs." ;

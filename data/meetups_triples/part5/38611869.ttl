        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daphne Walker (born 1930) is a New Zealand singer popular in the 1950s. Many of her recordings were with Bill Sevesi and Bill Wolfgramm. She had also dueted with George Tumahai. One of her early recordings which proved to be successful was \"Haere Mai\" that was recorded in 1954 and released on the Tanza label. She was born on Great Barrier Island. In 1949 she won a talent quest and was recruited to perform a series of 15-minute live broadcasts on 1YA radio with Bill Wolfgramm on steel guitar and Johnny Bradfield on guitar. Her first recording was on the Tanza label, \"Haere Mai\" in 1955. This went on to sell over 40,000 copies. She recorded more than 30 sides for Tanza. \"Hootchy Kootchy Henry\" became a hit in Samoa. Her last release was in 1966, the album \"Coconut Grove\". Walker suffered from stage fright and was reluctant to perform before an audience, preferring studio recording. In 2012 she was awarded the Nostalgia Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand." ;

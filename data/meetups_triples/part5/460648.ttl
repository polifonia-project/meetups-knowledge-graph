        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexander O'Neal (born November 15, 1953) is an American R&B singer, songwriter and arranger from Natchez, Mississippi. O'Neal came to prominence in the mid-1980s as a solo artist, with eleven Top 40 singles on the US R&B chart, three of which also reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. However, he enjoyed more mainstream success in the United Kingdom, achieving fourteen Top 40 singles on the UK Singles Chart between 1985 and 1996, along with three top ten albums on the UK Albums Chart. His solo singles, sometimes dealing with lost love, include \"If You Were Here Tonight\", \"Fake\", \"Criticize\", \"The Lovers\", \"(What Can I Say) To Make You Love Me\", \"All True Man\", \"Love Makes No Sense\" and \"In the Middle\". He is also known for duets with Tabu labelmate Cherrelle such as \"Saturday Love\" and \"Never Knew Love Like This\". AllMusic described O'Neal as having a \"tough voice [that] has the same grain and range as that of Otis Redding.\"" ;

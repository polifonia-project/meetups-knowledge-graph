David was born in Wels, Upper Austria in 1925. He moved to Germany in 1934 at the age of nine with his father, composer Johann Nepomuk David, and mother. Thomas's younger brother, Lukas David, (born 1934) later became a violinist. In 1967, at the age of forty-two, he married (Persian: منصوره قصری), a Persian Opera singer and they moved to Iran. David was the chief conductor of the orchestra of the National Iranian Television NITV, and also taught at the University of Tehran for seven years until 1973. He had an enormous and invaluable role in the growth and development of the Classical music in Iran. He conducted numerous masterpieces in different venues in Iran from late 1960s to late 1990s." ;

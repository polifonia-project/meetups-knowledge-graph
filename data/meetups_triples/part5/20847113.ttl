        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jaime Ramon Misa Paredes, better known simply as Jim Paredes (Tagalog pronunciation: [pɐˈɾedɛs]), is a Filipino singer, composer, television host, writer and actor. He is known as one of the members of popular musical trio APO Hiking Society (along with Danny Javier and Boboy Garovillo). He is the son of Ester Paredes Jimenez, a staunch martial law activist. Paredes' most prominent solo work, Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo, became the anthem of the peaceful People Power Revolution that overthrew the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. It was participated in by 15 Filipino artists in April of that year, and its English version \"A New and Better Way\" was launched in Australia a few months after. In recognition of its significance, the lyrics of the song are embedded on a wall of the EDSA Shrine, a chapel commemorating the revolution. Paredes' other compositions includes When I Met You, Panalangin, Batang-Bata Ka Pa, Yakap sa Dilim, and Nakapagtataka." ;

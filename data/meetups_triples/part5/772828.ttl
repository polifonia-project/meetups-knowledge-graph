He became prominent in the early 1960s, establishing himself on the West Coast as a folk singer with an earthy style and powerful voice. Among his best-known songs are \"Joy to the World\", \"The Pusher\", \"No No Song\", \"Greenback Dollar\", \"Della and the Dealer\", and \"Never Been to Spain\". He was a prolific character actor, appearing in dozens of film and television roles over several decades, memorably as a father figure in a number of films, including The Black Stallion (1979) and Gremlins (1984)." ;

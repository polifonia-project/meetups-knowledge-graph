        mtp:hasAbstract        "Vladimir J. Konečni (born October 27, 1944) is an American and Serbian psychologist, aesthetician, poet, dramatist, fiction writer, and art photographer, currently an Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. In psychology, he has carried out influential work in several distinct areas, related to each other by strong methodological concerns. Konečni has conducted laboratory and field studies of human emotion and (physical and verbal) aggression, as well as of altruistic behavior, which have been cited in numerous social psychology textbooks. Decision-making has been another major research area in which Konečni has been heavily involved (in close collaboration with Dr. Ebbe B. Ebbesen, a long-time colleague at the University of California, San Diego). Most of their work has been devoted to judicial decisions in the criminal justice system, but they have also conducted a number of frequently cited studies of drivers' decisions in real-world settings. Finally, Konečni has for some forty years worked in the multi-faceted interdisciplinary domains of empirical aesthetics, psychology of art, and music psychology. Notable groups of his studies in these areas have addressed the highly specialized and technical problems of the \"golden ratio\" (or \"golden section\") in visual art, the significance of macrostructure in music, peak aesthetic responses, and the relationship between music and emotion." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kang Daniel (Korean: 강다니엘; commonly stylized as KANGDANIEL; born Kang Eui-geon [강의건]; December 10, 1996) is a South Korean singer-songwriter, actor, and businessman who rose to fame in early 2017 as the first-place winner of the second season of reality competition series Produce 101. He is a former member of the show's resulting boy group Wanna One and is currently active as a solo artist. Following the end of Wanna One's activities as a group, Kang took a six-month hiatus from the entertainment industry and took over management of his career. In mid-2019, he released his solo debut extended play (EP), Color on Me, which was a commercial success that topped South Korea's Gaon Album Chart. His subsequent works from his color series titled Cyan (2020) and Magenta (2020) also topped the Gaon Album Chart with the former's title track earning Kang his first domestic top ten single. Further solidifying his career as a solo artist, Kang earned his first top five single in Korea as well as his first solo appearance on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart through the single \"Paranoia\". He then released the third and final chapter of his \"color trilogy\", Yellow (2021), which topped the Gaon Album Chart and contained his first domestic number one single titled \"Antidote\". Alongside his music career, Kang appeared as the host of Mnet's Street Woman Fighter (2021), Street Dance Girls Fighter (2021), and Street Man Fighter (2022). He also made his acting debut through the Disney+ Star original series, Rookie Cops (2022). His other ventures include establishing an independent entertainment company named Konnect Entertainment to manage his own career that has since expanded to manage other artists in addition to himself." ;

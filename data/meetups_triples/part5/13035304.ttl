        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kavus Torabi (Persian: كاووس تورابى; born 5 December 1971) is a British-Iranian musician and composer, record label owner and broadcaster. A multi-instrumentalist, he is known for his work in the psychedelic, avant-garde rock field (primarily as a guitarist). Torabi was one of the founding members of the Monsoon Bassoon (as singer, guitarist and one of the two primary composers), was a member of cult psychedelic rock group Cardiacs, and fronts and plays guitar for the current lineup of legendary psychedelic band Gong. Torabi also leads his own group Knifeworld and is a member of Guapo and the Utopia Strong. He sometimes tours and records with Mediæval Bæbes and Rob Crow, and frequently collaborates with other notable artists working in left-field music." ;

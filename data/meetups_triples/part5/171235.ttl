        mtp:hasAbstract        "Terius Gray (born March 26, 1975), better known by his stage name Juvenile, is an American rapper best known for his work with Birdman's Cash Money Records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, both solo and as a member of the label's then-flagship group, Hot Boys. Juvenile's career began in the early 1990s as a teenager with bounce music recordings that made him a local star. He released his debut album Being Myself in 1995. After signing to Cash Money, Juvenile released Solja Rags in 1997, which included the major local hit \"Solja Rag\". A year later, he released the multi-platinum 400 Degreez, which included his first nationwide hits \"Ha\" and \"Back That Azz Up\" (featuring Mannie Fresh and Lil Wayne). He released other successful solo albums for Cash Money: Tha G-Code (1999), Project English (2001) and Juve the Great (2003), which included the number-one hit \"Slow Motion\" (featuring Soulja Slim). After leaving Cash Money, Juvenile has released several other albums, including The Beginning of the End (2004) with group UTP, which included the anthem \"Nolia Clap\" and the solo number-one album Reality Check (2006)." ;

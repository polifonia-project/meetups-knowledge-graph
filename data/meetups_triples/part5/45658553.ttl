        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jessica Alyssa Cerro (born 14 August 1995), who performs as Montaigne, is an Australian art pop musician and Twitch streamer. Her debut album, Glorious Heights, was released on 5 August 2016 and peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2016 she won Breakthrough Artist â€“ Release for the album and was nominated for three other categories. In April 2016 she was a featured vocalist on Hilltop Hoods' track, \"1955\", which reached No. 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart. She was supposed to represent Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 with her song \"Don't Break Me\", until the contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, she represented Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 with the song \"Technicolour\", but did not qualify from the semi-final, becoming the first Australian entrant not to qualify to the final since the debut of Australia in 2015." ;

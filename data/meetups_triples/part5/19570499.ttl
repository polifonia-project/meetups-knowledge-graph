        mtp:hasAbstract        "Helen Darling (born May 1, 1965 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana) is an American country music artist. Darling has released one studio album on Decca Nashville. She also charted one single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart; \"Jenny Come Back,\" peaked at No. 69 in 1995. Darling sang background vocals on Garth Brooks' 1994 single \"The Red Strokes.\" Brooks returned the favor by singing background on Darling's album. Two years later, she sang \"I Will Always Be With You\" for MGM's All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 with Frazier River frontman Danny Frazier in the credits. She also sang \"Love Led Us Here\" for Disney's Muppet Treasure Island with John Berry in the credits. As a songwriter, Darling has had her songs recorded by Reba McEntire, Little Big Town and Mindy McCready, among others. She also co-wrote Jo Dee Messina's Number One song \"Bring On the Rain.\"" ;

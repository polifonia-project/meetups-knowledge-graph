The first artist signed to David Geffen's Asylum label, she released two albums on Asylum and partially completed a third album before dying of a drug overdose in 1979.Her eponymous debut album was released in late 1971 and was followed about 18 months later by Heart Food. In 1974, she recorded demos for a third album, which never was completed. The demos were released posthumously with other rarities on the 2005 two-disc collection Dreams Come True. Sill was influenced by Bach, while lyrically her work drew substantially on Christian themes of rapture and redemption." ;

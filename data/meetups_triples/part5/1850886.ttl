        mtp:hasAbstract        "Martin Reverby, better known by his stage name Martin Rev, (born December 18, 1947) is an American musician and one half of the influential synth-punk band Suicide. Rev has also released several solo albums for a number of record labels, including ROIR and Puu. His style varies widely from release to release, from harsh and abrasive no wave (Martin Rev) to light bubblegum pop (Strangeworld) to heavy synthesizer rock (To Live). Rev also works with Stefan Roloff, doing soundtracks for Roloff's video work. He contributed to the Raveonettes' 2005 album, Pretty in Black. In 2008, while Martin was working on the album Stigmata, his wife Mari died. The album, dedicated to her, is strong in religious imagery with most songs being titled in Latin. Kris Needs called the album a \"brilliantly executed excursion into modern electronic classical music\"." ;

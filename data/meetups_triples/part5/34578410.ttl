        mtp:hasAbstract        "Freddie Gorman (born Frederick Cortez Gorman, April 11, 1939 â€“ June 13, 2006) was an American musician and record producer, most famous as a singer, songwriter for the Motown label in the late 1960s and mid 1970s. He was a native of Detroit, Michigan. A member of the Motown quartet The Originals, Freddie Gorman was also a vital unsung component of the Motown label's formative development. He co-wrote the label's first #1 pop hit \"Please Mr. Postman\", by the Marvelettes. In 1964 the biggest selling group of all time, the Beatles released their version, and in 1975 the Carpenters took it back to #1 again. This was the second time in pop history (after \"The Twist\" by Chubby Checker) that a song reached #1 in the US twice. In 2006, \"Please Mr. Postman\" was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame." ;

He led the progressive-jazz sextet, Herculaneum, and the Los Angeles-based guitar, bass, and drums trio, Dylan Ryan / Sand. He is a founding member, along with Dave (The Diminisher) McDonnell, of Chicago's experimental rock trio, Michael Columbia. He has also performed with Icy Demons, Tim Kasher, Cursive, and Rainbow Arabia. Dylan Ryan's drumming style with Sand has been compared to Ginger Baker, John Bonham, and Stewart Copeland.

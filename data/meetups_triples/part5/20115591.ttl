        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mariana Espósito (born 10 October 1991), known professionally as Lali Espósito (or simply Lali), is an Argentine singer, actress, dancer and model. Espósito began her career as an actress and singer in 2003 when she joined the cast of the children's telenovela Rincón de Luz, created by producer Cris Morena. She had other subsequent supporting roles in telenovelas Floricienta (2004–2005) and Chiquititas (2006), and a main role in Casi Ángeles (2007–2010), the latter of which increased her fame in Latin America, the Middle East, and Europe. From 2007 to 2012, Espósito, along with four other cast members from Casi Ángeles, was part of the teen pop band Teen Angels, which originated from the series. The group was commercially successful internationally, and toured throughout Argentina and countries such as Israel, Spain, Italy and Latin America. Espósito also sang in the soundtracks of Rincón de Luz and Chiquititas. Following her role in the 2011 telenovela Cuando Me Sonreís and her portrayal of Abigail Williams in the Buenos Aires production of The Crucible, Espósito made her film debut in La Pelea de mi Vida in 2012, starring alongside Mariano Martínez and Federico Amador. She was part of the cast of the television comedy Solamente Vos (2013), portraying the daughter of Adrián Suar's character. In 2015, Espósito portrayed her first lead role on TV as the title character in Esperanza Mía. Its soundtrack album, in which she appeared on nine of the eleven tracks, received a platinum certification in Argentina for selling over 40,000 copies. For her portrayals in the crime-thriller film The Accused (2018) and Netflix's action crime drama television series Sky Rojo (2021), Espósito received critical acclaim. Her debut solo studio album, A Bailar, was released on 21 March 2014, featuring pop and EDM influences. \"A Bailar\" was released as the lead single of the homonymous album. The album spawned the singles \"Asesina\", \"Mil Años Luz\", \"Del Otro Lado\" and \"Histeria\". The album peaked at No. 5 in Argentina and at No. 3 in Uruguay. In 2016, she released her second studio album Soy after the previous release of the songs \"Unico\" and \"Soy\". Her third album, Brava was released in 2018, spawning the singles \"Una Na\", \"Tu Novia\", \"100 Grados\" (feat. A.CHAL), \"Besarte Mucho\", \"Sin Querer Queriendo\" (feat. Mau y Ricky), \"Caliente\" (feat. Pabllo Vittar) and \"Somos Amantes\". In 2020, Espósito released her fourth studio album, Libra. The album was preceded by the singles \"Laligera\", \"Como Así\" (feat. CNCO), \"Lo Que Tengo Yo\", \"Fascinada\" and \"Ladrón\" (feat. Cazzu). A Bailar and Soy were certified gold in Argentina by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF), while Brava and Libra were certified platinum. Espósito's accolades include Six Gardel Awards, Five MTV Europe Music Awards, one Kids' Choice Award, thirteen Argentine Kids' Choice Awards, Seven MTV Millennial Awards, one Heat Latin Music Award, one Martin Fierro Award, one Tato Award, and nominations for the Billboard Latin Music Awards, Premios Lo Nuestro, and the Seoul International Drama Awards.

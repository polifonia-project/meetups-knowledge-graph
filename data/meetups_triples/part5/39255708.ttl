In 1977 he graduated from the Conservatory in Amsterdam. From 1976 to 1996, he was the first chair oboist in the Radio Filharmonisch Orkest and the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra.

Schneemann plays a wide repertoire in various formations, ranging from older music (on modern oboe and classical/baroque oboe) to contemporary music. Many composers have written music especially for him, including Tristan Keuris, Wolfgang Rihm, John Zorn, , Kevin Volans, George Crumb, György Kurtág and Jacob ter Veldhuis.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Louie Bellson (born Luigi Paulino Alfredo Francesco Antonio Balassoni, July 6, 1924 â€“ February 14, 2009), often seen in sources as Louis Bellson, although he himself preferred the spelling Louie, was an American jazz drummer. He was a composer, arranger, bandleader, and jazz educator, and is credited with pioneering the use of two bass drums. Bellson performed in most of the major capitals around the world. Bellson and his wife, actress and singer Pearl Bailey (married from 1952 until Bailey's death in 1990), had the second highest number of appearances at the White House (only Bob Hope had more). Bellson was a vice president at Remo, a drum company. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1985." ;

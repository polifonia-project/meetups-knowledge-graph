        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jarrad Seng (born 2 February 1988) is an Australian photographer and filmmaker. Based in Perth, his work often mixes with his interests in music, travel and volunteering. Seng frequently collaborates with English singer Passenger, serving as his tour photographer on seven tours between 2012 and 2015, as well as directing many of his music videos. Seng has also toured with American band Matchbox Twenty and Australian folk singer Stu Larsen. His personal photographic work has seen him traveling to both Tanzania and Iceland twice. Seng has held four solo exhibitions — Portraits of Tanzania (2011), Alltervatn (2013), Spirit of the Masaai (2014) and The Space Between (2015) — and a collaborative exhibition, Parallels (2016), with Perth-based artist Amok Island. Seng received international media coverage in December 2014 after a prank video, in which he walked around a music festival disguised as American DJ Steve Aoki, went viral. In 2013, Seng was a finalist in the Propel Youth Arts Award category at the 2013 WA Youth Awards. Seng competed in season four of Australian Survivor, which began airing in late July 2017." ;

PinkPantheress's songs, which are frequently short in length and include samples of music from the 1990s and 2000s, span a number of genres, including bedroom pop, drum and bass, alt-pop, and 2-step garage. In 2021, while attending university in London, she posted several songs to TikTok that went viral, including \"Break It Off\", and she subsequently signed to Parlophone and Elektra Records. Her singles \"Just for Me\" and \"Pain\" from her debut mixtape To Hell with It (2021) peaked in the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart and were certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

He is a member of the Botany Boyz, part of the Screwed Up Click scene first started by DJ Screw. His first solo album, Third Coast Born, was an underground success, eventually reaching #67 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album was revamped and re-released in 2000, and this also peaked at #91 on the same chart. C-Note has released several albums since then, and made numerous guest appearances (including with Fat Pat, Lil' Flip and Z-Ro). His fourth full-length, Network'n, was released in 2006, and his fifth, Birds Vs Words, in 2016." ;

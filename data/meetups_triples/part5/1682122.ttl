He wrote the #2 Billboard hit, \"The Rapper\", with the Jaggerz in 1970 and was a member of Wild Cherry after the group had a #1 hit with \"Play That Funky Music.\" He also achieved fame as a solo artist in the early 1980s with the #29 hit \"Ah! Leah!\" and the #37 hit \"Love Is Like a Rock.\" In addition to performing on the first three Jaggerz albums and the fourth and final Wild Cherry album, Iris with his solo band has released eleven studio albums, one EP, two live albums, and two compilation albums. He continues to intermittently release new material and tour throughout the greater Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Cleveland areas." ;

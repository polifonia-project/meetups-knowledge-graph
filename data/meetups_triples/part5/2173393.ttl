        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mirko Pajčin (Serbian Cyrillic: Мирко Пајчин; born 13 October 1966), known by his stage name Baja Mali Knindža (Serbian Cyrillic: Баја Мали Книнџа, lit. 'Baja Little Kninja'), is a Bosnian Serb folk singer and songwriter. He is often described as part of the turbo-folk scene, and is known for his Serbian nationalist songs. His cousin was the pop-folk recording artist Ksenija Pajčin. Pajčin is not to be mistaken with Nedeljko Bajić Baja (to whom he owes his nickname due to their physical resemblance), who is another Bosnian Serb folk singer." ;

He released several albums spanning R&B, soul, jazz and adult contemporary. He is known for his soulful and versatile vocals. Caldwell released the hit single and his signature song \"What You Won't Do for Love\" from his double platinum debut album Bobby Caldwell in 1978. After several R&B and smooth jazz albums, Caldwell turned to singing standards from the Great American Songbook. He wrote many songs for other artists, including the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single \"The Next Time I Fall\" for Amy Grant and Peter Cetera. Caldwell's music is frequently sampled by hip hop and R&B artists." ;

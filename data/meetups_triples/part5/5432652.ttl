        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nora O’Connor (born April 2, 1968) is an American, Chicago-based musician. Though primarily known for her vocals, O'Connor also plays guitar and bass. For much of 2013, O'Connor toured internationally as a singer in Iron and Wine. She also records and performs with longtime collaborator, Andrew Bird. O'Connor plays bass and sings back-up for Kelly Hogan (supporting Hogan's release \"I Like To Keep Myself In Pain\" on ANTI- Records) and in 2010, Wilco's Jeff Tweedy enlisted O'Connor and Hogan as primary vocalists on gospel legend Mavis Staples’ Grammy Award-winning album You Are Not Alone. In the studio and on the stage, O'Connor has backed (among others) Neko Case, Jakob Dylan, The New Pornographers, The Decemberists, Archer Prewitt, John Wesley Harding, Hushdrops, Justin Roberts and Robbie Fulks. O'Connor has released two solo CDs. The first, Cerulean Blue, was released by Uncommon Ground Coffeehouse in Chicago in 1996. The second, Til the dawn, was released by Bloodshot Records on August 24, 2004. NOTE: In 2022 Nora announced: \"My new album 'My Heart' comes out October 7, 2022 on Pravda Records.\" In the mid-1990s, she formed the Nora O'Connor Band, with herself on lead vocals and guitar, Lisa Wertman Crowe on bass and vocals, Tony Ventura on guitar and Mark Cameron on drums. O'Connor has two sons, and lives in Evanston, Illinois." ;

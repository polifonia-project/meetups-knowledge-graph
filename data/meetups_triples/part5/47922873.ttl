        mtp:hasAbstract        "Leonard Louis \"Lenny\" McBrowne (January 24, 1933 â€“ October 4, 1980) was an American jazz drummer. He was a prolific hard bop drummer with a recording career that started in the 1950s and ended in the mid 1970s. As a bandleader he fronted Lenny McBrowne and the Four Souls, which released two albums in 1960. A disciple of Max Roach, McBrowne was often compared to Chico Hamilton due to the \"suavely exotic tendencies of his solo work\". Among McBrowne's own disciples is avant-garde drummer Andrew Cyrille." ;

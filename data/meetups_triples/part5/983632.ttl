They released their cover of Aqua's hit song \"Barbie Girl\" on 8 October 2007 and it entered the UK Singles Chart at number 26. Their second single titled \"Honey Love\" entered the chart on 22 August 2008 at number 125. This song was a cover of Donny Osmond's Number One UK Hit \"Puppy Love\" and was a tie-in with Sugar Puffs cereal (as their mascot is the Honey Monster, who also appeared in the video). As of 2019 they are both married and have one child each (both a few months apart and girls)." ;

As a record producer he was most closely associated with Roy Orbison, and was also involved in the early careers of Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson. Foster suggested to Kris Kristofferson the title and theme of \"Me and Bobby McGee\", which became a hit for Kristofferson, Roger Miller, and Janis Joplin, and for which Foster received a co-writing credit." ;

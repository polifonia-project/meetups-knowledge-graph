        mtp:hasAbstract        "Linda Solomon (born May 10, 1937, Boston, Massachusetts) is an American music critic and editor. Although she has written about various aspects of popular culture, her main focus has been on folk music, blues, R&B, jazz and country music. Living at 95 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village during the early 1960s, she became a columnist for The Village Voice, capturing Village night life in club reviews for the weekly \"Riffs\" column. \"The Bet\" is a memoir by Ted White describing Harlan Ellison, Linda Solomon and others involved in a curious incident at 95 Christopher in 1960. White wrote: That summer Harlan found his own apartment -- three doors up the street, in a building with an elevator. And he met a woman, Linda Solomon, who also lived in the same building. Linda would go on to a career of her own in writing and editing, but that was mostly ahead of her in 1960. Linda had a small but well-selected record collection, containing a goodly amount of jazz. A dispute over the bandleader on one record in Solomon's collection prompted Ellison to bet his entire record collection against a single album in White's collection. Ellison also mentioned her briefly in his memoir \"Memos From Purgatory.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald Graham Archer AM (25 October 1933 – 27 May 2007) was an Australian Test cricketer. He was born in the inner Brisbane suburb of Highgate Hill, was educated at Brisbane’s Anglican Church Grammar School and played in 19 Tests from 1953 to 1956. He was the younger brother of Ken Archer, who also played Test cricket for Australia. A highly gifted all rounder, Archer's career was cruelly cut short by a serious knee injury in the one-off Test against Pakistan in Karachi in 1956 when he was just 23. A permanent fixture in the team from his debut against South Africa at Melbourne in 1952–53 until stricken by injury in 1956 Archer was a stylish middle order batsman and robust opening bowler. When England toured Australia in 1954–55 he topped the Australian bowling averages with 13 wickets (16.53). In the 2nd Test at Sydney he took 3–12 and 3–53 and his 49 was the highest score in the Australian first innings. After a slow start he excelled on the West Indian tour of 1955, recording 84 in Trinidad, 98 at Bridgetown and a maiden test hundred at Kingston to finish the series with 364 runs at 60.66. Showcasing his all round talent he took 18 wickets at 25.05 in England in 1956 but fell injured in Pakistan on the way home. He played in 1958–59 as a specialist batsmen but though he averaged over 40 for Queensland his knee would not allow him to continue in the game. After retiring from the playing field he worked as a TV executive, became Cricket Australia's Code of Behaviour Commissioner and officiated as an International Cricket Council match referee. He was made a life member of the Queensland Cricket Association for his services to cricket. Archer died of lung cancer in Brisbane on 27 May 2007. Cricket Australia Chairman Creagh O'Connor paid the following tribute \"Ron Archer had a brief and very successful Test career which was tragically cut short by an injury of the type that modern sports medicine would today probably have overcome...But while his international playing career was too short, he still devoted an energetic and cheerful lifetime of support to the game that he loved, contributing right up until his final summer.\" On 12 June 1995, Archer was named a Member of the Order of Australia in recognition of services to the community, cricket and business. On 14 July 2000, Archer was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his cricketing achievements. In 2009 Archer was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame." ;

On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the same era. His use of the bass clarinet helped to establish the instrument within jazz. Dolphy extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists. His improvisational style was characterized by the use of wide intervals, in addition to employing an array of extended techniques to emulate the sounds of human voices and animals. He used melodic lines that were \"angular, zigzagging from interval to interval, taking hairpin turns at unexpected junctures, making dramatic leaps from the lower to the upper register.\" Although Dolphy's work is sometimes classified as free jazz, his compositions and solos were often rooted in conventional (if highly abstracted) tonal bebop harmony." ;

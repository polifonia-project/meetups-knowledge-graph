        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Donovan (born 9 August 1962) is an English keyboardist, composer, photographer and remixer, perhaps best known for being a founding member of Big Audio Dynamite, a band led by Mick Jones, former lead guitarist, and co-lead vocalist of the Clash. Following a brief touring stint with the Sisters of Mercy in 1990, he became a founding member of Dreadzone. Although he officially left Dreadzone during the development of Zion Youth, he returned in 1996. Donovan was named after his grandfather, Daniel Donovan through his father, also called Terence Daniel Donovan, the photographer. Through his father he is related to half sister Daisy Donovan and Rockstar Games co-founder Terry Donovan. He was married to the actress, model and singer Patsy Kensit, from 1988 to 1991. He took the album cover photograph for Big Audio Dynamite's debut studio album, This Is Big Audio Dynamite (1985), which also meant that he wasn't featured in it. It was the same with their debut single \"The Bottom Line\"." ;

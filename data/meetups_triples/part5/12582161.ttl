Lawson was originally signed to MCA Nashville Records, which released his debut album Chase the Sun in 2002. It produced two minor chart singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, including the No. 28-peaking \"Goodbye on a Bad Day\". Two years later, he was signed to Equity Music Group, a label owned by singer Clint Black. Although Lawson charted two more singles during his tenure on this label, his album for Equity (titled Big Yee-Haw) was not released." ;

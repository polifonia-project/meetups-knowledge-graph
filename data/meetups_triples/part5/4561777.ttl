        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harry Brooks (September 20, 1895 â€“ June 22, 1970) was an American writer of popular songs, jazz pianist and composer in the 1920s to the early 1950s. Brooks was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania. After graduating from his hometown high school in 1914, he worked as a pianist with Pittsburgh bands (dance orchestras) and then as a staff composer for a publishing company. He is recalled mostly in the 21st century for his work with his friends Thomas \"Fats\" Waller and the lyricist Andy Razaf. Brooks was the composer of several hit songs including his composition \"Ain't Misbehavin'\", written with Waller and Razaf. Also with Razaf and Waller, Brooks scored the Broadway shows Snapshots of 1921 and Connie's Hot Chocolates. He died, aged 74, in Teaneck, New Jersey." ;

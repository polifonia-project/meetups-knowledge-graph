He has won the Sanremo Music Festival twice, in 2019 with the song \"Soldi\" and in 2022 alongside Blanco with the song \"Brividi\". His Sanremo victories allowed him to represent Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest in those respective years, finishing in second place in 2019 and in sixth place in 2022 as the host entrant. Mahmood has released two studio albums, Gioventù bruciata and Ghettolimpo, both of which reached the top two of the Italian albums chart." ;

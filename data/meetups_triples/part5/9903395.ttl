        mtp:hasAbstract        "Noah Benjamin Lennox (born July 17, 1978), also known by his moniker Panda Bear, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and co-founding member of the band Animal Collective. In addition to his work with that group, Lennox has released six solo LPs since 1999, with his influential 2007 album Person Pitch inspiring numerous subsequent acts. His subsequent albums Tomboy (2011) and Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper (2015) both reached the Billboard 200. Lennox was primarily raised in Baltimore, Maryland, where he sang tenor in his high school chamber choir, and studied piano and cello. The name \"Panda Bear\" derived from his habit of drawing pandas on his early mixtapes as a teenager. He and the other members of Animal Collective began collaborating in the late 1990s. He has lived in Lisbon, Portugal, since 2004. He was featured on Daft Punk's track \"Doin' It Right\", from their Grammy Awardâ€“winning album Random Access Memories (2013)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Faheem Rashad Najm (born September 30, 1984), better known by his stage name T-Pain, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Throughout his career as a singer, T-Pain popularized the creative use of the Auto-Tune pitch correction effect, used with extreme parameter settings to create distinctive vocal sounds. His success with the effect has influenced several other major artists to adopt it as well, namely rappers Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne, Kanye West, Future and Travis Scott, among others. After signing with singer Akon's Konvict Muzik, T-Pain subsequently founded his own vanity label imprint, Nappy Boy Entertainment, established in 2005. His debut album, Rappa Ternt Sanga, was released in 2005. In 2007, T-Pain released his second album, Epiphany, which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. His third album, Three Ringz, was released in 2008. The albums included a string of hit singles, including \"I'm Sprung\", \"I'm 'n Luv (Wit a Stripper)\", \"Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')\", \"Bartender\", \"Can't Believe It\", and \"5 O'Clock\". T-Pain has earned two Grammy Awards from 12 nominations, one with Kanye West for \"Good Life\" and the other with Jamie Foxx for \"Blame It\". From 2006 to 2010, T-Pain was featured on more than 50 chart topping singles. His most successful feature to date was on Flo Rida's debut single \"Low\", which has since been certified diamond (10Ã— platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Matthias Paul (German pronunciation: [maˈtiːas ˈpaʊ̯l]; born 16 December 1971), known professionally as Paul van Dyk (German: [ˈpaʊ̯l fan ˈdʏk]) is a German DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true renowned DJs, van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release Reflections. He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by Mixmag in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide. A trance producer starting in the early 1990s, van Dyk quickly achieved popularity with his remix of \"Love Stimulation\" by Humate on the record label MFS in 1993 and with his hit single \"For an Angel\". Van Dyk is an avid trance lover to this day. He indicated in an interview that he ended up giving himself the Belgian-sounding stage name Paul van Dyk, because he used to incorporate many Belgian dance records into his DJ sets in the early 1990s. Van Dyk is currently the radio host of \"Vonyc Sessions with Paul\" on Dash Radio." ;

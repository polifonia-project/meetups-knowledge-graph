        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Arnold Griffin III (April 24, 1928 â€“ July 25, 2008) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. Nicknamed \"the Little Giant\" for his short stature and forceful playing, Griffin's career began in the mid-1940s and continued until the month of his death. A pioneering figure in hard bop, Griffin recorded prolifically as a bandleader in addition to stints with pianist Thelonious Monk, drummer Art Blakey, in partnership with fellow tenor Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis and as a member of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band after he moved to Europe in the 1960s. In 1995, Griffin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music." ;

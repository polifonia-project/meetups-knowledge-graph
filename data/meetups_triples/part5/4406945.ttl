        mtp:hasAbstract        "Murray Wachs (June 2, 1924 – January 1, 2010), better known as Bingo Gazingo, was a poet from New York City, who was a postal worker for most of his career. Two versions, each also titled Bingo Gazingo, were released of the only single-artist album ever released by WFMU—the first on cassette, the second on CD. (Among other changes, the CD replaced Ravel's Boléro with an improvised bolero as accompaniment to \"Bingo's Bolero\".)Bingo's parents were big fans of the game of Bingo, which resulted in him getting his notable name." ;

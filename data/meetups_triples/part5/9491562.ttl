        mtp:hasAbstract        "Derek Hess is an American artist based in Cleveland, Ohio. His creative career grew largely out of his ability to express the emotion in the indie, hardcore, and metal scenes of the mid-1990s. From concert posters to politically charged fine art pieces, Cleveland-based artist Derek Hess has tested the waters of both the music and art world for over 15 years. Hess began creating promotional flyers for shows in Cleveland using his own unique vision and a tendency to playing off the band's names and genres. These flyers soon garnered the attention of countless bands as well as both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Louvre in Paris, who both have Hess' art in their permanent collections. In addition to posters for bands such as Deftones, Thursday, Clutch, and Pearl Jam, Hess has created CD covers for bands like Sepultura, Motion City Soundtrack, Converge, and Unearth. He has also been featured on television shows and in magazines including TLC, Food Network, MTV, Fuse, VH1, Alternative Press as well as many others." ;

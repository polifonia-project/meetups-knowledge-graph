        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lucille Bogan (born Lucile Anderson; April 1, 1897 â€“ August 10, 1948) was an American classic female blues singer and songwriter, among the first to be recorded. She also recorded under the pseudonym Bessie Jackson. Music critic Ernest Borneman noted that Bogan was one of \"the big three of the blues\", along with Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith. Many of Bogan's songs have been recorded by later blues and jazz musicians. Many of her songs were sexually explicit, and she is generally considered to have been a \"dirty blues\" musician. In 2022, she was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame." ;

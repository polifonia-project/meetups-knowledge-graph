        mtp:hasAbstract        "Armand Hug (December 6, 1910, New Orleans - March 19, 1977, New Orleans) was an American jazz pianist. He was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, and spent most of his life there. When he was 13, he was playing professionally. In 1926 he joined a band led by Harry Shields, then was a member of the New Orleans Owls in 1928. He recorded for the first time in 1936, with Sharkey Bonano, though for his career he was known as a solo pianist. He played dixieland jazz in local clubs and hosted a local television show." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Neko Richelle Case (/ˈniːkoʊ ˈkeɪs/; born September 8, 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and member of the Canadian indie rock group the New Pornographers. Case has a powerful, untrained contralto voice, which has been described by contemporaries and critics as a \"flamethrower,\" \"a powerhouse [which] seems like it might level buildings,\" \"a 120-mph fastball,\" and a \"vocal tornado\". Critics also note her idiosyncratic, \"cryptic,\" \"imagistic\" lyrics, and credit her as a significant figure in the early 21st-century American revival of the tenor guitar. Case's body of work has spanned and drawn on a range of traditions including country, folk, art rock, indie rock, and pop and is frequently described as defying or avoiding easy generic classification." ;

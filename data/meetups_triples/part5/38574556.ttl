        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mitchell Coby Michael Grassi (born July 24, 1992) is an American singer, musician and songwriter from Arlington, Texas. Known for his high tenor voice, Grassi came to international attention as the founder and performer of two groupsâ€”the quintet a cappella collective Pentatonix and the duo Superfruit with Scott Hoying. As of June 2021, Pentatonix has released eleven albums (two of which have been number ones) and two EPs, have had four songs in the Billboard Hot 100, and won three Grammy awards as \"the first a cappella group to achieve mainstream success in the modern market\". As of February 2019, Superfruit's YouTube channel has over 2.5 million subscribers and has accumulated over 392 million views. In April 2020, Grassi debuted a solo moniker, Messer, doing a DJ set of \"a range of dark, techno tunes\" at Paper's Club Quarantine Zoom event during the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. \"Machine\" was released as Messer's debut single in July 2021, with \"Angels Pray\" following later that month. Messer's debut EP Roses was released August 2021." ;

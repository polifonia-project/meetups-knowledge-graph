She is known for the house songs, \"Work It Out\" and \"Freedom\", the latter of which reached number 18 in the UK Singles Chart shortly after her death. The two founding members of the band were Gino Piscitelli and Paul Ross, who both hailed from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. Piscitelli and Ross wrote the lyrics and music for Shiva, whilst Dean sang the songs. Franco Piscitelli was the unofficial fourth member of the band." ;

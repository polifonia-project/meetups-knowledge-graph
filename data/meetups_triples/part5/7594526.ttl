        mtp:hasAbstract        "Melville John Galley (8 March 1948 â€“ 1 July 2008) was an English guitarist, singer and songwriter, best known for his work with Whitesnake, Trapeze, Finders Keepers and Phenomena. Galley was born in Cannock, Staffordshire, England. While a member of Whitesnake, he badly injured his arm in an accident at a fairground in Germany and had to leave the band, as he was unable to play the guitar because of nerve damage as a result of incompetent surgery. Later he became known for playing with \"The Claw\", a specially developed spring and wire device fitted to his hand which enabled him to play the guitar again. Together with his brother Tom Galley and Wilfried Rimensberger, he was a founding member of Phenomena where his songwriting and guitar playing skills had a major impact on its success. On 7 February 2008 Galley revealed that he was suffering from esophageal cancer, and had only a short time to live. \"I have been very lucky. I have seen some great bands, and played with many great musicians. And I have enjoyed some tremendous experiences. I am thankful that I can say a proper goodbye to all the friends I have made, who are now rallying round me\". Galley died on 1 July the same year at the age of 60." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dirk Bruinenberg (born 21 August 1968) is a Dutch musician known as the former drummer of several European progressive metal and power metal bands, including: Elegy, Ian Parry's Consortium Project and Adagio. He is often recognized for his intricate drumming style and technical double bass patterns. In the late 1980s and early 90s, Bruinenberg played with Dutch thrash metal bands Abyss and Vulture. Subsequently, he joined Elegy in 1993, replacing original drummer Ed Warby of Gorefest. He recorded seven albums with Elegy until 2002. The band toured throughout Europe and Japan alongside Stratovarius, Kamelot, Annihilator, Phantom Blue, The Gathering, Gorefest and others. After Elegy, Bruinenberg joined French progressive metal band Adagio with whom he recorded their first two albums. He left the band in late 2003, citing personal reasons coupled with conflicting schedules. His performance in Adagio has been critically acclaimed due mainly to the high complexity of the music. Bruinenberg is also featured as a guest drummer in Kamelot's The Fourth Legacy and continues recording and performing with several other artists, including: Kristoffer Gildenl√∂w (Dial, Pain of Salvation, Lana Lane), David Readman (Pink Cream 69), Ebony Ark, The 11th Hour, Maiden uniteD and Bob Catley (Magnum). In 2013 he was announced as the new drummer of the melodic rock project Place Vendome. Bruinenberg currently plays with the new Dutch melodic rock band 7 Miles to Pittsburgh (with ex Elegy bass player, Martin Helmantel) and with the solo band of former Elegy bandmate Patrick Rondat." ;

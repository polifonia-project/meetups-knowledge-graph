        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark Charig (born 22 February 1944 in London) is a British trumpeter and cornetist. He was particularly active in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when he played in settings as diverse as Long John Baldry's group, Bluesology, Soft Machine, and Keith Tippett's group and his Centipede big band. Charig also featured on several King Crimson albums, being particularly prominent in a long solo on the title track of Islands, on the title track of Lizard and on the track \"Fallen Angel\" on the Red album, as well as in a work-in-progress version of \"Starless\". In the mid-1970s he also toured with the group Red Brass, which featured singer Annie Lennox. He also appeared with the Brotherhood of Breath and recorded with Mike Osborne, as well as releasing his own Pipedream LP on Ogun Records. He is also a member of the London Jazz Composers' Orchestra. He now lives in Germany and is a member of the Wuppertal-based Conduction Orchestra. More recently, he has recorded KJU: a CD of quartet improvisations with the group \"Quatuohr\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rudy La Scala (born January 20, 1954) is a singer-songwriter and record producer, born in Rocca di Papa, Lazio, Italy. At a young age, La Scala migrated to Venezuela, where he completed his primary and secondary studies, while learning piano and guitar. He began his career with a short lived band named Las Explosiones de Goma in the 1960s. In 1971 he was presented as a solo artist under the name Flavio, finally presenting himself as Rudy La Scala in 1974. His work as a songwriter has been very successful, including songs recorded by Karina, María Conchita Alonso, Guillermo Dávila, Kiara, Ruddy Rodríguez, Proyecto M, Carlos Mata, and Gerardo Mora. As a performer, La Scala reached the top of the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart twice with \"El Cariño Es Como Una Flor\" and \"Por Qué Será\" in the 1990s. He is the only record producer with 12 platinum and nine gold certified albums in Venezuela. He also performed the theme song of the Venezuelan soap opera Cristal among others." ;

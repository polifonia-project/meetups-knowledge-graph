        mtp:hasAbstract        "Raden Haji Oma Irama, better known as Rhoma Irama (born December 11, 1946), is an Indonesian dangdut singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sundanese descent. Starting from the late 1960s, he began his musical career as Rhoma Irama as a part of the pop band Orkes Melayu Purnama, pioneering several dangdut music elements. He then formed his band Soneta Group, achieving multitudes of musical successes with groundbreaking dangdut style which incorporates Western, Malay, and Bollywood influences. From the late 1970s, he began transforming into more Islamic-oriented style, commanding the religiously pious popular music culture. During the height of his stardom in the 1970s, he was dubbed \"Raja Dangdut\" (\"the King of Dangdut\") with his Soneta Group. He has also built his career in the film industry. He has been active as well in the political arena, with a history of joining campaigns for the Islamic Party United Development Party (PPP)." ;

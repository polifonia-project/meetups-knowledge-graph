Two days after her birth, Time dubbed Carter \"the most famous baby in the world.\" That same day, her vocals were featured on the song \"Glory\", by her father Jay-Z, which earned her a Guinness World Record for being the youngest person to have a charted song on any Billboard chart. She has been the subject of depictions in media, including impersonations on Saturday Night Live and RuPaul's Drag Race. In 2020, she was featured on \"Brown Skin Girl\", a single by her mother Beyoncé, alongside Wizkid and Saint Jhn. The song won her accolades including an NAACP Image Award; the BET Her Award, making her the youngest winner of a BET Award; and a Grammy Award for Best Music Video for the same song, which earned her another Guinness World Record for being the youngest individually credited Grammy Award winner, and the second youngest overall." ;

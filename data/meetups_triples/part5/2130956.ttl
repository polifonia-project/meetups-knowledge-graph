In 2019 a second location was opened in downtown Los Angeles. In January 2021, Trombino came under fire after an anonymous Twitter account claimed he terminated several employees for attempting to organize for better working conditions and form a union. Trombino, as well as current and former employees, stated that the information in the tweet was false." ;

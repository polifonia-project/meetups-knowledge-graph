        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elizabeth Rowe (born 1974) is an American flutist, known for being the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and for a gender discrimination lawsuit. Rowe grew up in Oregon where she started playing the flute as a child. She earned a music degree and has held several titled positions with professional orchestras. In 2004, she won a blind audition against 250 other applicants to become the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 2018, she filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the Boston Symphony Orchestra alleging she was paid less on account of her gender. The case was settled out of court in February 2019." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Arturo \"Chico\" O'Farrill (October 28, 1921 â€“ June 27, 2001) was a Cuban composer, arranger, and conductor, best known for his work in the Latin idiom, specifically Afro-Cuban jazz or \"Cubop\", although he also composed traditional jazz pieces and even symphonic works. Born to an Irish father and a German mother, he played the trumpet early in his career. He composed works for Machito (Afro-Cuban suite with Charlie Parker, 1950) and Benny Goodman's Bebop Orchestra (\"Undercurrent Blues\"), and arranged for Dizzy Gillespie and Stan Kenton, among others. In the 1990s, O'Farrill led a big band that took up residence at New York's Birdland nightclub. Chico's son, pianist Arturo O'Farrill, eventually took over the band." ;

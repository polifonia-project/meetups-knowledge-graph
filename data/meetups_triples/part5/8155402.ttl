        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hind (Arabic language:هند‎), also spelled Hend, is a female singer from Bahrain. Her work includes popular Arabic music as well as traditional Khaliji music. She was discovered by the musician Anwar Abdullah, and gave her the nickname \"Hind\", but her real name is Suhair. Hind's debut album Rabeie El Galb was released in 2000, after which she became well recognized in Bahrain and the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. It was only after she signed her 2005 album Al Ghroob with Rotana, that she became recognized and famous around the Arabian Gulf region." ;

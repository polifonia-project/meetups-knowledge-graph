He was best known as a third of the hip hop trio Migos along with his uncle Quavo and first cousin once removed Offset. The group scored multiple top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 including \"MotorSport\" featuring Nicki Minaj and Cardi B, \"Stir Fry\", \"Walk It Talk It\" featuring Drake, and \"Bad and Boujee\" featuring Lil Uzi Vert, the latter of which peaked at the top of the chart (although Takeoff was not present on the single). He also received two Grammy Award nominations. On November 1, 2022, Takeoff was shot and killed in Houston, Texas." ;

A graduate of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, Little joined The Divine Comedy in 2002 and is still a regular member of the band. He has since toured and recorded with The Duckworth Lewis Method, Clare Teal, Duke Special, Maggie Reilly, A Girl Called Eddy and Chris Difford. As a jazz bass player he plays regularly with Ian Shaw, Lea DeLaria, Symeon Cosburn, and Nina Ferro. Little has also played with Nick Cave and Ben Folds. Little released a solo bass album Mandala in 2010, where he uses live looping to create ambient soundscapes. He released a second solo album called \"The Knowledge of Things To Come\" in 2011, following the \"Rejectamenta EP\" which featured five additional tracks from the Knowledge sessions, and an acoustic album \"[un]plugged\" in 2012. An improvised trio album \"Foreground Music, Vol. I\" was released in 2012 with pianist Jez Carr and Iona saxophonist Mike Haughton." ;

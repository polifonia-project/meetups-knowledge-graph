        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clive Wearing (born 11 May 1938) is a British former musicologist, conductor, tenor and keyboardist who has chronic anterograde and retrograde amnesia. He lacks the ability to form new memories and cannot recall aspects of his memories, frequently believing that he has only recently awoken from a comatose state. In educational psychology contexts, Wearing's dual retrograde-anterograde amnesia phenomenon is often referred to as '30-second Clive' in reference to his 30-second episodic memory capacity." ;

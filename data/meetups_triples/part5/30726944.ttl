        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rovena Stefa (born 27 April 1979, in Fier) is an Albanian singer. Her first album Falling Snow had much success in Europe. In 2005 and 2006 Rovena had success with the songs \"Do You Come With Me\", \"Wedding\", \"With Karrocieri Hats\", I'm Sweet\", \" Llokum\", \"Address Without A Name\" and \"Slash Dot Dash\". In 2009, she released two videos for the songs \"Mall\" and \"Viva Eagle and Fatherland\". The video for \"Mall\" created a controversy over its eroticism. In the Summer of 2009 Stefa opened the \"Rovena Club\"; a discotheque on the coast of Durres. In 1996, she won an award for the best interpretation song \"I Am The Image\" (Duet with Heriot Long) at \"The Magic Song '99\". In November 2020, she was announced as the Albanian representative in the Turkvision Song Contest 2020 with the song \"Zjarr\". However, she withdrew from the contest in December 2020." ;

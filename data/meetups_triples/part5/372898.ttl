        mtp:hasAbstract        "Adriano Celentano (Italian: [adriˈaːno tʃelenˈtaːno]; born 6 January 1938) is an Italian musician, singer, composer, actor, and filmmaker. He is dubbed \"il Molleggiato\" (the flexible one) because of his dancing. Celentano's many albums frequently enjoyed both commercial and critical success. Often credited as the author of both the music and lyrics of his songs, according to his wife Claudia Mori, some were written in collaboration with others. Due to his prolific career, both in Italy and abroad, he is considered one of the pillars of Italian music.Celentano is recognized for being particularly perceptive of changes in the music business, and is credited for having introduced rock and roll to Italy. As an actor, Celentano has appeared in 39 films, mostly comedies." ;

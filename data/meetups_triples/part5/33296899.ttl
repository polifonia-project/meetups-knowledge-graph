        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andy Gibson (born September 15, 1981) is an American country music singer. He co-wrote \"Don't You Wanna Stay\", a duet between Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson which reached No. 1 on the country music charts in 2011. Later in the year, he signed to R&J Records and released his debut single, \"Wanna Make You Love Me\". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four stars out of five, saying that it \"begin[s] gathering attention after frequent listens.\" The song has been made into a music video directed by David McClister, which has aired on CMT. Gibson moved to Curb Records in April 2012 following the closure of R&J, although some R&J staff continued promotion of \"Wanna Make You Love Me\". Gibson's first Curb single, \"Summer Back\", entered the charts in late 2012." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roberto Martin Fernandez Nievera (/njɛˈvɛərə/; born November 30, 1986) is a Filipino singer-songwriter and record producer. He is a former VJ for the music channel Myx and radio DJ at Wish 107.5. The eldest child of singers Martin Nievera and Pops Fernandez, he began his own professional career as a VJ after winning Myx VJ Search 2010. At the time of this success, he was studying music production at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde and serving as the vocalist and guitarist of an indie rock band. Nievera tried deviating from his musical parents as a child, but eventually became interested in music after learning to play the guitar in school. In 2012, Nievera signed with PolyEast Records and released his debut album, the blues rock-influenced Overwait, for which he won New Male Recording Artist of the Year at the PMPC Star Awards for Music. He was the producer for No More Words (2012), a duet album by his parents. Nievera has since self-produced his subsequent albums. He mounted his first solo concert in 2013, in support of his second album, Nightmares (2012), which he had independently made available a few months prior. He signed with Homeworkz and released Dare, his third album which explored alternative pop, in stages throughout 2016, during which he ventured into radio, hosting The Roadshow at Wish 107.5 until 2018. Nievera is currently based in Los Angeles, California." ;

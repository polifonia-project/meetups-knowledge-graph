        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ivan Vaughan (18 June 1942 – 16 August 1993) was a boyhood friend of John Lennon and later a schoolmate of Paul McCartney at the Liverpool Institute, both commencing school there in September 1953. He was born in Liverpool on the same day as McCartney. He played tea-chest bass part-time in Lennon's first band, The Quarrymen, and was responsible for introducing Lennon (then 16) to McCartney at a community event (the Woolton village fête) on 6 July 1957, where The Quarrymen were performing. McCartney barely 15, impressed Lennon by knowing all the lyrics to Eddie Cochran's song, Twenty Flight Rock and with his accomplished guitar playing. Lennon decisively invited McCartney to join the band, which following a night's sleep, he conveyed through Vaughan that he accepted the offer. This decision, led to the formation of the formidable Lennon and McCartney's songwriting partnership and subsequently as,The Beatles the group went on to achieve worldwide success." ;

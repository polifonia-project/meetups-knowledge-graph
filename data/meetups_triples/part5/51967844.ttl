Mowg has won multiple awards for his works in various films, such as I Saw the Devil (2010), Masquerade (2012), Hwayi: A Monster Boy (2013), Dongju: The Portrait of a Poet (2016), The Age of Shadows (2016) and Burning (2018). He was named Mowg because of his similar appearance to Mowgli in The Jungle Book. In addition to his work in film, Mowg has produced albums by other artists, including the debut album by Korean pop star Jang Yoon-ju, Dream." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark Andrew White (born 1 April 1961) is an English singer, songwriter, composer, musician and record producer. Born in Sheffield, England, White first entered the music industry in the late 1970s as lead singer and keyboardist of the electronic band Vice Versa. After releasing one album with the band in 1980, Vice Versa member Martin Fry emerged as lead singer and the band opted to transform into a new band called ABC. White resigned himself to composing ABC's music while also playing guitar and keyboards before retiring from music after the release of their sixth studio album, Abracadabra, in 1991. As ABC's keyboardist he used a variety of instruments, including the E-mu Emulator, the Yamaha DX7 and the Fairlight CMI. In 2014, White came out of retirement to reform Vice Versa with Stephen Singleton." ;

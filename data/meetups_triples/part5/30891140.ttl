Shortly after, Bartosz started producing electronic dance music using Ableton Live and by 2009, the 20-year-old had already established 17:44 Records. His 2010 single \"Heaven\" topped the Russian Music Charts for 73 consecutive weeks, peaking at #3 on the Russian Billboard chart. Since 2011, Bartosz has been commissioned to remix artists such as A-Trak, Amanda Wilson, Bob Sinclar, Boy George, David Vendetta, Dillon Francis, Eddie Amador, Gary Pine, Janelle Monáe, Jean Beauvoir, Joachim Garraud, Joe Smooth, Kurd Maverick, Olav Basoski, Perry Farrell, Ron Carroll, Sander Kleinenberg, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Steve Edwards and Tommy Trash just to name a few. With over 100 productions (originals, remixes and ghost tracks) on labels like Armada, Defected, Dim Mak, Flamingo, Fool's Gold, Hed Kandi, Ministry of Sound, Nettwerk, Spinnin', Stealth or Subliminal, Bartosz quickly gathered the attention of high-profile DJ's including Tiësto, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Knife Party, The Crystal Method, Paul Oakenfold, Alesso, Nicky Romero, Showtek, Cedric Gervais, Morgan Page, John Dahlbäck and Michael Woods.

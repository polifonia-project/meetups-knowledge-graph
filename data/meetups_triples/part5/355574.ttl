Colloquially nicknamed as Juanga (pronounced [ˈxwaŋɡa]) and El Divo de Juárez, Juan Gabriel was known for his flamboyant style, which broke barriers within the Latin music industry. Widely considered one of the best and most prolific Mexican composers and singers of all time, he has been referred to as a pop icon. Having sold an estimated of 60 million records worldwide, Juan Gabriel was among Latin America's best selling singer-songwriters. His nineteenth studio album, Recuerdos, Vol. II, is reportedly the best-selling album of all time in Mexico, with over eight million copies sold. During his career, Juan Gabriel wrote around 1,800 songs. Among his most recognized penned songs are \"Amor eterno\", \"Querida\", \"Yo no nací para amar\", \"Hasta que te conocí\", \"El Noa Noa\", \"No tengo dinero\", \"Abrázame muy fuerte\", \"Te lo pido por favor\", \"En esta primavera\", \"Pero qué necesidad\", \"Te sigo amando\", \"Siempre en mi mente\", \"De mí enamórate\", and \"Lo pasado, pasado\", among others; all of them, performed by him and many other artists." ;

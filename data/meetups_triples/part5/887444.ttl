Famous for her \"tantalizing\", \"untamed spitfire\" voice, she is one of the most noted performers of the ranchera and corrido genres; she was nicknamed La Tigresa de la Canción Ranchera and later known simply as \"La Tigresa\" (Spanish pronunciation: [la ti´ɣɾesa]). At the same time, she developed a film career of more than a dozen films. She is one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. In the 1970s and 1980s, Serrano achieved great success as an actress and producer in a series of controversial stage plays, highlighting the controversial play Naná (1973). In the decade of the 1990s, she also ventured into politics and occupied a seat in the Mexican Senate.In her later years, she was the center of multiple scandals and controversies. She has appeared in celebrity gossip magazines and television shows because of her political career as senator of her home state of Chiapas from 1994 to 1997." ;

He is Korean by birth, but his career consists of producing mostly Japanese music and original soundtracks for anime. His biggest contribution to Japanese music has been through his two biggest singles for the soundtracks of popular shōnen anime during the early 2000's. His first single, \"Baby It's You\", was used as the ninth ending theme for the anime Bleach. His second single, \"Pride of Tomorrow\", was the second ending theme for the anime D.Gray-Man." ;

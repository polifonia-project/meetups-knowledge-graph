        mtp:hasAbstract        "Indiggo and the Indiggo Twins are the stage names for Gabriela Modorcea and Mihaela Modorcea, twin sisters and Romanian-American professional actresses, dancers, singers, and writers. They were born in Romania, received visas for extraordinary artistic abilities, became American citizens and live in New York City. They speak English, French, German and Romanian and sing in seven languages. They wrote, composed, choreographed, designed and perform their Off Broadway play Wicked Clone The Cinema Musical (2018) based on Mihaela's 500-page novel Wicked Clone or how to deal with the evil (2016). New York City Guide's Theatre Editor Griffin Miller describes the show as “a rare piece of visual and audio creativity” that \"turns the tables on tradition by telling ‘the story of a vampire bitten by a human being’”. They wrote, composed, arranged, designed and performed their original cast recording album of 25 \"immortal\" songs. American rappers Kanye West and Jay-Z sampled Indiggo's single \"La La La\" (2011) on their collaborative album Watch the Throne (2011). New York Times reviewer Jon Caramanica describes the sample as \"moving\" and a \"gem\". Their singles \"Hip Hop Jam\" (2003) and \"Be My Boyfriend\" (2006) entered the top of the charts and the singles and their album Indiggo found commercial success in Germanic territories. They signed a worldwide, multi-year, co-publishing/grand rights deal with international music publisher Imagem. Mihaela has written two poetry books, Rage and Love and Wicked Clone or how to get reborn. Gabriela appeared in the film National Lampoon's Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj (2006) and in the Law & Order: Special Victims Unit episode \"Hothouse\". They were semi-finalists on America's Got Talent and acted in the Russian-American film Lyubov v bolshom gorode (No Love in the Big City). They have performed in a number of awarded musicals and finished seventh in the Romanian qualifiers for the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest." ;

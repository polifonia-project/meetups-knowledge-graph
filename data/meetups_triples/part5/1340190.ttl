        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lewis Robert Wasserman (March 22, 1913 – June 3, 2002) was an American talent agent and studio executive, described as \"the last of the legendary movie moguls\" and \"arguably the most powerful and influential Hollywood titan in the four decades after World War II.\" His career spanned the nine decades from the 1920s to the 2000s; he started working as a cinema usher before dropping out of high school, rose to become the president of MCA and led its takeover of Universal Pictures, during which time Wasserman “brought about changes in virtually every aspect of show business.” In 1995, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. Several years later, he spoke of his ongoing work at Universal to Variety, saying, \"I am under contract here for the rest of my life, and I don't think they would throw me out of my office - my name is on the building.\"" ;

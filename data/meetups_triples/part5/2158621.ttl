        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Francis Robert Dolan (16 October 1939 â€“ 26 December 2007) was an Irish entertainer, recording artist, and pop singer. Chiefly known in Ireland for his association with showbands and for his innovative style and high pitched singing voice, he had a wide appeal with many international fans. His energetic and charismatic stage performances influenced his long standing advertising slogan: \"There's no show like the Joe show\". The only Irish singer to reach number one in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Dolan was a persistent presence in the music charts in Ireland and overseas." ;

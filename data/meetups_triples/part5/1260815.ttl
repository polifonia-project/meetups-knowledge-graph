He came to prominence in the late 1970s as a member of the post-punk band Magazine and went on to work with Visage, The Birthday Party, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and the electro musicians Pan Sonic. In addition to prolific solo work, Adamson has also remixed Grinderman, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Recoil and Depeche Mode. He created the seven-minute opus \"Useless (Escape From Wherever: Pts. 1 & 2!)\" remix for the latter band in 1997. He also worked on the soundtrack for David Lynch's surrealistic crime film Lost Highway." ;

Born in Mississauga, Ontario, to Italian Canadian parents, she began posting covers of songs on YouTube at age 13. After uploading acoustic covers of songs such as \"Love Yourself\" and \"Sweater Weather\" online, she signed with EP Entertainment and Def Jam Recordings in 2014 and released her debut single, \"Here\", the following year. It peaked at number 19 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and was a sleeper hit in the US, peaking at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Cara's debut studio album, Know-It-All (2015), peaked at number 8 on the Canadian Albums Chart and at number 9 on the Billboard 200. The album's third single, \"Scars to Your Beautiful\", peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2016. In 2017, Cara collaborated with DJ and producer Zedd on the single \"Stay\", which is certified seven-times platinum in Canada, and featured alongside Khalid on rapper Logic's song \"1-800-273-8255\". Cara has received nominations for four Grammy Awards, winning the Best New Artist in 2018. She was nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the 2019 Latin Grammys for her collaboration with Juanes on \"Querer Mejor\".

The album won Juno Award for Album of the Year and Juno Award for Pop Album of the Year while she went on to win Juno Award for Songwriter of the Year.

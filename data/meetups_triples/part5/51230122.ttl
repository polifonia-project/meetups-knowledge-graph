        mtp:hasAbstract        "Johnny Laws (born January 12, 1943) is an American Chicago blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. A regular performer for over half a century in Chicago's South Side clubs, Laws has released two albums, including Burnin' in My Soul, of which Blues & Rhythm magazine in November 1999 noted, \"It's a real shame that Johnny Laws has been unjustly ignored in the past... This is an enjoyable CD... Full marks to those folks at Electro-Fi.\" His version of McKinley Mitchell's \"End of the Rainbow\" demonstrates his versatility and vocal range. In an April 1999 editorial leader, the Toronto Star remarked that \"South Side Chicago fave Johnny Laws... [is] winning plaudits for his seductive, soul-drenched blues.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Towa Tei (テイ・トウワ（鄭 東和）, Tei Tōwa, ; September 7, 1964) is a Japanese artist, record producer, and DJ. Born in Yokohama, Japan, Towa debuted as a member of Deee-Lite, from the US label Elektra Records in 1990 and shot to fame via their international hit single, \"Groove Is In the Heart\". He made his solo debut with the album Future Listening! in 1994. He has since relocated back from New York to rural Nagano prefecture in Japan. Towa's second studio album, Sound Museum (1997), became his highest charting effort at number 17 on the Oricon charts. Its single, \"GBI (German Bold Italic)\" featuring Kylie Minogue and Haruomi Hosono, reached number 50 and 63 in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively. He saw continued success with 1999's Last Century Modern as its fourth single, \"Let Me Know\" featuring Chara, became one of his best known songs. His concept party, \"Hotel H\", started in 2009 as a social spot for music industry people in Tokyo." ;

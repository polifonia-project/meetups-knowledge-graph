        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jono El Grande (born July 29, 1973) is the stage name of Jon Andreas Håtun. Jono El Grande is an autodidactic Norwegian composer, band leader, guitarist and conductor. He is the leader of the Norway Symphony Orchestra. Jono El Grande claims that his extreme mixture of genres and timbres is a result of his musical vision: moving away from the traditional concept of 'music as a result of social processes'. Although Jono El Grande is enjoying modest growth on the European avant-garde scene, he is most well known in his own country for his eccentric and amusing performance art/dada-inspired live shows. In 2000, he formed The Jono El Grande Orchestra, renamed in 2005. Jono El Grande has released six albums, Utopian Dances (Krusedull Prod. - 1999), Fevergreens (Rune Grammofon - 2003), Neo Dada (Rune Grammofon - 2009), \"Phantom Stimulance\" (Rune Grammofon - 2010), (Rune Arkiv - 2011) and \"\" (Rune Grammofon - 2015), in addition to contributing with compositions on other projects (both Rune Grammofons anniversary albums 1 & 2\" and on Wire Tapper #21\", the avant-garde music magazine The Wire's 21st edition of their CD series). Jono El Grande served as festival composer for Happy Days 2007, presented by Ny Musikk, the Norwegian section of ISCM – International Society For Contemporary Music. He also became a member of Norwegian Society Of Composers fall 2010.

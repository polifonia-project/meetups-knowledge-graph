        mtp:hasAbstract        "Aimee Anne Duffy (born 23 June 1984) is a Welsh singer, songwriter and actress. Her music style has been described as a mixture of soul, blue-eyed soul, pop rock, neo soul and pop music. Duffy released her debut album, Rockferry, in 2008. It topped the charts in several music markets, and led to worldwide attention. It was preceded by the lead single \"Mercy\", which reached number one in several countries and the top ten in twelve others. In 2009, Duffy received the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for Rockferry, one of three nominations, and won three out of four Brit Awards nominations, for British Breakthrough, Best British Female and Best British Album. In 2010, she made her acting debut in the film Patagonia and released her second studio album Endlessly to moderate success. In February 2011, she announced an indefinite hiatus from music. She briefly returned in 2015, appearing in the film Legend and later contributed three songs to its soundtrack. In 2020, Duffy explained her long term absence from the music industry, with her saying that she had been recovering following being abducted and sexually assaulted. According to Duffy's official website, she is currently signed to Universal Recording Group." ;

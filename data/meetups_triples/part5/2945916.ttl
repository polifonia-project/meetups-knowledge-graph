        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yona Wallach (Hebrew: יונה וולך; June 10, 1944 – September 26, 1985) was an Israeli poet. Her surname also appears as Volach. She is considered a revolutionary Israeli feminist and post-modernist. Wallach was a promising young poet, though she neglected her talents for many years as she used drugs and explored the Jewish mysticism that influenced much of her work. She didn't receive critical acclaim for her work until the late 70s. Wallach developed breast cancer in 1981 and refused treatment for many years. She died in 1985." ;

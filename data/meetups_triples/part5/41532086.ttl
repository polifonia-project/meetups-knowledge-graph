        mtp:hasAbstract        "Adam Steffey (born November 24, 1965) is an American mandolin player, best known for playing in the bluegrass and old-time styles. He spent time as a member of bands such as Alison Krauss & Union Station, Mountain Heart, Lonesome River Band, the Dan Tyminski Band, the Boxcars, and the Isaacs. He was most recently a member of the Highland Travelers, which announced on November 15, 2018 that they were disbanding, with Steffey pursuing an alternative profession other than music. However, his retirement from music was short-lived, as he joined the band Volume Five just a few months later. Steffey has also performed with such artists as Kenny Chesney, Clint Black, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, the Dixie Chicks, James Taylor, Rhonda Vincent, Ronnie Bowman, Jim Mills, and others." ;

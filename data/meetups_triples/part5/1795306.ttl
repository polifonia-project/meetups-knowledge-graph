        mtp:hasAbstract        "Beth Hart (born January 24, 1972) is an American musician from Los Angeles, California. She rose to fame with the release of her 1999 single \"LA Song (Out of This Town)\" from her second album Screamin' for My Supper. The single was a number one hit in New Zealand, as well as reaching the top 5 of the US Adult Contemporary and Top 10 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 charts. Hart has had several well received collaborations with guitarist Joe Bonamassa, beginning in 2011 with Don't Explain, followed with the Grammy-nominated Seesaw (2013) and Live in Amsterdam (2014), the latter of which topped the Billboard Blues Album Chart, a chart that she has topped six times. Her latest work with Bonamassa was the 2018 album Black Coffee. Hart has had two number 1 singles in Denmark, \"As Good as It Gets\" and \"Learning to Live\", as well a double platinum-selling album, Leave the Light On. Hart's most recent album, released in 2022, is A Tribute to Led Zeppelin, a collection of covers of Led Zeppelin songs." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alanis Nadine Morissette (/əˈlɑːnɪs ˌmɒrɪˈsɛt/ ə-LAH-niss MORR-ih-SET; born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American singer, songwriter, and actress. Known for her emotive mezzo-soprano voice and confessional songwriting, Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s with two dance-pop albums. In 1995, she released Jagged Little Pill, an alternative rock-oriented album with elements of post-grunge, which sold more than 33 million copies globally and is her most critically acclaimed work to date. It earned her the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1996 and has been made into a rock musical of the same name in 2017, which earned fifteen Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical. The album was also listed in the 2003 and 2020 editions of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time Guide. The lead single, \"You Oughta Know\", was also included at #103 in their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. A highly anticipated, more experimental follow-up, electronic-infused album, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, was released in 1998. Morissette assumed creative control and production duties for her subsequent studio albums, including Under Rug Swept (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavors of Entanglement (2008), Havoc and Bright Lights (2012), and Such Pretty Forks in the Road (2020). Her latest album, The Storm Before the Calm, which features ambient music, was released in 2022. Her well-known singles \"You Oughta Know\", \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", \"Head Over Feet\", \"Uninvited\", \"Thank U\", and \"Hands Clean\" reached top 40 in the major charts around the world, including ten top-40 hits in the UK, 3three top-10 in the US and Australia, and twelve top-10 hits in her native Canada. She also holds the record for the most No. 1s on the weekly Billboard Alternative Songs chart for any female soloist, group leader, or duo member. She is listed on VH1's 1999 \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" at number 53. Morissette has won seven Grammy Awards, fourteen Juno Awards, one Brit Award, and has sold more than 75 million records worldwide. She has been dubbed the \"Queen of Alt-Rock Angst\" by Rolling Stone." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Paul Antony Young (born 17 January 1956) is an English musician, singer and songwriter. Formerly the frontman of the short-lived bands Kat Kool & the Kool Cats, Streetband and Q-Tips, he became a teen idol with his solo success in the 1980s. His hit singles include \"Love of the Common People\", \"Wherever I Lay My Hat\", \"Come Back and Stay\", \"Every Time You Go Away\" and \"Everything Must Change\", all reaching the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. Released in 1983, his debut album, No Parlez, the first of three UK number-one albums, made him a household name. His smooth yet soulful voice belonged to a genre known as \"blue-eyed soul\". At the 1985 Brit Awards, Young received the award for Best British Male. Associated with the Second British Invasion of the US, \"Every Time You Go Away\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1985. It also won Best British Video at the 1986 Brit Awards. In July 1985, Young appeared at Live Aid held at Wembley Stadium, London, performing the Band Aid hit \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (having sung the opening lines on the original single release) and his own hits \"Come Back and Stay\" and \"Every Time You Go Away\", with Alison Moyet joining him on stage to perform \"That's The Way Love Is\". Since the mid-1990s, Young has performed with his band Los Pacaminos." ;

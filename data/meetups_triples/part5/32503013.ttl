Broadway's first big break came when he produced the animated music video for deceased rapper, Big Pun's \"How We Roll\" single. Broadway went on to become one of the most sought after video directors and creative director at 50 Cent's G Unit. Broadway's talent quickly caught the attention of 50 Cent where he started producing several animated music videos and promos for 50 Cent and G Unit. In 2008, Broadway and 50 Cent created the social networking and news website, ThisIs50.com. Within a few years, ThisIs50.com has become one of the most popular websites in the World.

She began her career as a principal artist at the Berlin State Opera and the Salzburg Festival. She was a leading soprano at the Metropolitan Opera from 1926-1936, and at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires from 1934 until her retirement from the stage in 1949. Her husband, conductor Erich Engel, was the director of the latter institution. Fleischer began teaching singing while living in Argentina. In 1949, she joined the voice faculty of the Vienna Conservatory. She later taught singing out of a private studio in Zürich." ;

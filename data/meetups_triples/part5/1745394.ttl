        mtp:hasAbstract        "Terri Lynn Sauson, known professionally as Terri Clark, born August 5, 1968, is a Canadian country music singer who has had success in both Canada and the United States. Signed to Mercury Records in 1995, she released her self-titled debut that year. Both it and its two follow-ups, 1996's Just the Same and 1998's How I Feel, were certified platinum in both countries, and produced several Top Ten country hits. Her fourth album, 2000's Fearless, though certified gold in Canada, was not as successful in the U.S., producing no Top 10 hits. Pain to Kill from 2003 restored her chart momentum in the U.S. with \"I Just Wanna Be Mad\" and \"I Wanna Do It All\", while a 2004 greatest hits album produced the Number One \"Girls Lie Too\". A non-album single, \"The World Needs a Drink\", and the 2005 album Life Goes On were her last releases for Mercury before she signed to BNA Records in 2007. There, she released the singles \"Dirty Girl\" and \"In My Next Life\". Although the latter went to Number One in Canada, she has not released an album for BNA. Clark's albums have accounted for more than twenty singles, including six Number Ones. \"If I Were You\", \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\", \"Emotional Girl\" and \"In My Next Life\" all topped the country charts in Canada (the former three were also U.S. Top Ten singles), \"Girls Lie Too\" reached number one only in the U.S., and \"You're Easy on the Eyes\" was number one in both countries." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kjell Höglund (born 8 December 1945 in Östersund, Sweden) is a Swedish singer-songwriter. Höglund, who found his musical breakthrough in the 1970s, is in his native country renowned for his mixture of realism, absurdism and surrealism. In 1992 he was nominated for a Grammis award for best male pop. Kjell Höglund has also published books with esoteric and pseudo-scientific content. Many of Höglund's beliefs presented in these works are similar to those of the Danish new age mystic Martinus." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yoon Son-ha (Korean: 윤손하; born November 17, 1975, Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea) is a South Korean actress, singer and television personality (gaijin tarento). She is signed onto Sony Music Japan's SME Records division. Since making her debut in the MBC dramas, she has acted in Korea and Japan, probably due to her fluency in Japanese as well as in her native Korean, where she has gained popularity from starring in the Fuji TV drama, Fighting Girl with co-star Kyoko Fukada. In Japan, however, she is known as Yun Sona (ユンソナ)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Barratt (born 4 March 1948), known professionally as Shakin' Stevens, is a Welsh singer and songwriter. He was the UK's biggest-selling singles artist of the 1980s. His recording and performing career began in the late 1960s, although it was not until 1980 that his commercial success began. His most successful songs were nostalgia hits, evoking the sound of 1950s rock and roll and pop. In the UK alone, Stevens has charted 33 Top 40 hit singles including four chart-topping hits \"This Ole House\", \"Green Door\", \"Oh Julie\", and \"Merry Christmas Everyone\"; his last Top 40 single was \"Trouble\" in 2005 apart from his Christmas song, which has re-entered the UK Singles Chart each December since 2007." ;

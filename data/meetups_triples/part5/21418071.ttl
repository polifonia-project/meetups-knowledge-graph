        mtp:hasAbstract        "Thomas Rexton Brumley (December 11, 1935 â€“ February 3, 2009) was an American pedal steel guitarist and steel guitar manufacturer. In the 1960s, Brumley was a part of the sub-genre of country music known as the \"Bakersfield sound\". He performed with Buck Owens and the Buckaroos on hits such as \"Cryin' Time\" and \"Together Again\". His solo on \"Together Again\" received particular acclaim by critics. Brumley later spent a decade with Ricky Nelson and performed on \"Garden Party\" and the In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969 album. In the 1960s Brumley purchased the manufacturing rights to Zane Beck's first pedal steel model and formed the ZB Guitar Company. Brumley later relocated the company to Texas, near his home in Kingsland where he managed the organization in his later years. He received an Academy of Country Music award for \"Top Steel Guitarist\" in 1966. Brumley was featured on the cover of Steel Guitarist Magazine in 1980, and is a member of the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame. His father was Albert E. Brumley, a noted gospel music songwriter and the composer of the classic \"I'll Fly Away\"." ;

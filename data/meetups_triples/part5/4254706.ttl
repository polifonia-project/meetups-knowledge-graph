His official website describes his music as being a \"blend Indian folk melodies with slide guitar blues, add a sprinkle of gospel and some compelling grooves and you'll get Manx's unique \"mysticssippi\" flavour.\" Manx plays the slide guitar, harmonica, six-string banjo, mohan veena and stomp box. He studied for five years in India with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. Bhatt is the inventor of the 20-stringed mohan veena, which has become Manx's signature instrument.He has released twelve albums in twelve years, and has his own record label Dog My Cats Records.He has received much recognition and many awards, including: seven Maple Blues Awards, six Juno nominations, the Canadian Folk Music Award in 2005 for Best Solo Artist, and CBC Radioâ€™s \"Great Canadian Blues Award\" in 2007. Manx was a nominee in the 8th Annual Independent Music Awards for his cover of Bruce Springsteen's \"I'm on Fire\".

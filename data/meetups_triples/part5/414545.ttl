        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dave Dudley (born David Darwin Pedruska; May 3, 1928 â€“ December 22, 2003) was an American country music singer best known for his truck-driving country anthems of the 1960s and 1970s and his semi-slurred bass. His signature song was \"Six Days on the Road\", and he is also remembered for \"Vietnam Blues\", \"Truck Drivin' Son-of-a-Gun\", and \"Me and ol' C.B.\". Other recordings included Dudley's duet with Tom T. Hall, \"Day Drinking\", and his own Top 10 hit, \"Fireball Rolled A Seven\", supposedly based on the career and death of Edward Glenn \"Fireball\" Roberts." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elem Germanovich Klimov (Russian: Элем Германович Климов; 9 July 1933 – 26 October 2003) was a Soviet and Russian filmmaker. He studied at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, and was married to film director Larisa Shepitko. Klimov is best known for his final film, 1985's Come and See (Иди и смотри), which follows a teenage boy in German-occupied Byelorussia during the Great Patriotic War and is often considered one of the greatest films ever made. His work also notably includes black comedies, children's movies, and period dramas." ;

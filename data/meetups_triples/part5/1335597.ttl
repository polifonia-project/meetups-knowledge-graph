He was best known as an early collaborator of the Beatles (though the record was labelled as being with \"The Beat Brothers\"), one of two non-Beatles (the other being Billy Preston) to receive label performance credit on a record with the group, and the only non-Beatle to appear as lead singer on a Beatles recording which charted as a single." ;

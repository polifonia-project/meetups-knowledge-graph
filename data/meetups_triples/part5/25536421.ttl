He has been a mathematics professor since 1970 at the University of Evansville. His research interests include triangle centers, integer sequences, and hymnology. Kimberling received his PhD in mathematics in 1970 from the Illinois Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Abe Sklar. Since at least 1994, he has maintained a list of triangle centers and their properties. In its current on-line form, the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, this list comprises tens of thousands of entries. He has contributed to The Hymn, the journal of the Hymn Society in the United States and Canada; and in the Canterbury Dictionary of Hymnology." ;

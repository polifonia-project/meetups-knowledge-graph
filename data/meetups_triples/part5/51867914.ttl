More recently, he has worked with other notable artists and producers such as Madonna, George Michael, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones and many others. He was bestowed the moniker of \"Sugarfoot\" by Michael Jackson due to becoming well known for his frequent use of advanced techniques on the foot pedals." ;

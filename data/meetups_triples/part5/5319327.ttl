        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Edward Davison (January 5, 1906 â€“ November 14, 1989), nicknamed \"Wild Bill\", was an American jazz cornetist. He emerged in the 1920s through his work playing alongside Muggsy Spanier and Frank Teschemacher in a cover band where they played the music of Louis Armstrong, but he did not achieve wider recognition until the 1940s. He is best remembered for his association with bandleader Eddie Condon, with whom he worked and recorded from the mid-1940s through the 1960s. His nickname of \"Wild Bill\" reflected a reputation for heavy drinking and womanizing in his younger years." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Chris Wright, CBE (born Christopher Norman Wright on 7 September 1944) is a British music industry executive. He has produced acts such as Ten Years After, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, Blondie, Ultravox and Spandau Ballet. He was the co-founder of Chrysalis Records and Music with his business partner Terry Ellis in 1968. Wright bought Ellis out in 1985, when the Chrysalis Group went public. Wright retained ownership of Chrysalis Music until 2010, when the publishing company was acquired by BMG Rights Management. In the '90s, Wright launched the Heart commercial radio brand in Birmingham and London, and the Midsomer Murders detective drama series broadcast on ITV in the UK and over 225 TV channels around the world. Between 1996 and 2001, Wright was the owner of Queens Park Rangers F.C. and the majority shareholder and chairman of Wasps Rugby Club. He continued as major shareholder and non-executive chairman of Wasps until 2008. Wright was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2005 for services to the Music and Entertainment Industries." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Edward Cleveland (December 5, 1931 – February 9, 1991) was an American gospel singer, musician, and composer. Known as the King of Gospel, Cleveland was a driving force behind the creation of the modern gospel sound by incorporating traditional black gospel, soul, pop, and jazz in arrangements for mass choirs. Throughout his career, Cleveland appeared on hundreds of recordings and earned four Grammy Awards. He was the first gospel musician to earn a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1984. For his trailblazing accomplishments, he is regarded by many as one of the greatest gospel singers who ever lived. He is best known for his gospel classics \"Lord, Help Me to Hold Out\", \"Peace Be Still\", \"I Don't Feel No Ways Tired\", “Where Is Your Faith\", \"The Love of God\", \"God Has Smiled on Me\", and his rendition of Gladys Knight & The Pips' \"You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me.\"" ;

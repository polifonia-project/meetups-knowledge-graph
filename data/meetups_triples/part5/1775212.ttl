He is most well known as a member of the group Village People, in which he was the construction worker character from 1978 to 1982 and from 1987 to 2013. Hodo was born in San Andreas, California, and was raised in Sacramento. He graduated in 1969 from California State University, Sacramento, where he majored in speech and acted in several campus productions, including Oh What a Lovely War, Carnival and Richard III. In 1972, he moved to New York, making his Broadway debut in Doctor Jazz in 1975. Hodo appeared as a chorus member in numerous musicals, including Salvation, a touring company of Funny Girl in 1972, a Broadway revival of Pal Joey in 1976 and The Red BlueGrass Western Flyer Show at the Goodspeed Opera House in 1977. He was also a guest on What's My Line as a roller skating fire eater. Hodo joined the Village People in 1978, and was with the group during its most commercially successful era. He appeared with the group in the 1980 musical film Can't Stop the Music and the accompanying promotional television special Magic Night which also featured Cher and Hugh Hefner.

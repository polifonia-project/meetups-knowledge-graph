        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter J. Wilhousky (Ukrainian: Пітер (Петро) Вільговський; 13 July 1902 – 4 January 1978) was an American composer, music educator, and choral conductor of Rusyn or Ukrainian ethnic extraction. During his childhood he was part of New York's Rusyn Cathedral Boys Choir and gave a performance at the White House to President Woodrow Wilson. He was featured on several broadcasts of classical music with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, including the historic 1947 broadcast of Verdi's opera Otello. In 1936, Wilhousky wrote a popular English version of the Ukrainian song \"Shchedryk\" by Mykola Leontovych and called it \"Carol of the Bells\". Wilhousky's 1944 choral arrangement of the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" has become \"arguably the most well-known choral arrangement of a hymn or anthem in the United States.\"" ;

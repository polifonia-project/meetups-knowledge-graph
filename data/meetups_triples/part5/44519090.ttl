Rado is a native of Westlake Village, California, where he formed Foxygen with his classmate Sam France in 2005. After releasing four albums with Foxygen, Rado began producing albums for other artists, including The Killers, The Lemon Twigs, Tim Heidecker, Whitney, Alex Cameron, Father John Misty and Weyes Blood. In 2018, Billboard called Rado \"one of indie rock's most in-demand producers\". Rolling Stone called him an \"analog fetishist who's become a producer of choice for a particular breed of like-minded indie-pop artists.\" Rado is married to singer-songwriter Jackie Cohen. He also appeared in a 2008 episode of the television series Weeds and a 2009 episode of the sitcom Community. Rado is of Hungarian descent. He studied screenwriting at the School of Visual Arts in New York." ;

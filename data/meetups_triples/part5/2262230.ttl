        mtp:hasAbstract        "Salvatore Adamo (born November 1, 1943) is a Belgian-Italian musician, singer and composer, who is known for his romantic ballads. Adamo was born in Comiso, Sicily, Italy, and has lived in Belgium since the age of three, which is why he has dual citizenship. Since 2001 Adamo holds the Belgian noble title of Ridder, similar to the English title of \"Knight\". He first gained popularity throughout Europe and later in the Middle East, Latin America, Japan, and the United States. He has sold more than 80 million albums and 20 million singles making him one of the most commercially successful musicians in the world. He mainly performs in French but has also sung in Italian, Dutch, English, German, Spanish, Japanese, and Turkish. \"Tombe la neige\", \"La nuit\", and \"Inch'Allah\" remain his best known songs. He is currently the best selling Belgian musician of all time." ;

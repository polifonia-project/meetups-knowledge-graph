        mtp:hasAbstract        "Romi Park (朴 璐美, Paku Romi, born January 22, 1972) is a Japanese actress and singer affiliated with LAL. She graduated from the Toho Gakuen College of Drama and Music and studied Korean at the Korean Language Institute (한국어학당) in Yonsei University. She won numerous awards, including the Best Actress Award at the 1st Seiyu Awards. Park is known for her roles as tough, calm and mature preteen or teenage boys who are often called prodigies in their fictional universes (for example, Tao Ren, Ken Ichijouji, Tōshirō Hitsugaya, Edward Elric, Kosuke Ueki and Natsume Hyūga). Her female roles also fit the \"tough/punk lady\" archetype (Temari, Nana Osaki and Teresa of the Faint Smile)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Christopher Joseph Isaak (born June 26, 1956) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and occasional actor. He is widely known for his breakthrough hit and signature song \"Wicked Game\", as well as other songs such as \"Blue Hotel\", \"Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing\" and \"Somebody's Crying\". He is known for his reverb-laden rockabilly revivalist style and wide vocal range. His songs generally focus on the themes of love, loss, and heartbreak. With a career spanning four decades, Isaak has released a total of 12 studio albums, toured, and received numerous award nominations. He is often compared to Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, Ricky Nelson, and Duane Eddy. Isaak is closely associated with film director David Lynch, who has used his music in numerous films. As an actor, he has had supporting roles and bit parts in films such as Married to the Mob, The Silence of the Lambs, Little Buddha, That Thing You Do! and Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, and starred in two television series: the sitcom The Chris Isaak Show and the talk show The Chris Isaak Hour." ;

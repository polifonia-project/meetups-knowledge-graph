        mtp:hasAbstract        "Krist Anthony Novoselic (/ˌnoʊvoʊˈsɛlɪtʃ/; Croatian: Novoselić; born May 16, 1965) is an American musician and activist. He was the bassist and co-founder of the rock band Nirvana. Novoselic and Kurt Cobain formed the band Nirvana in 1987 along with drummer Aaron Burckhard, whom they recruited. Through the late 1980s, Nirvana established themselves as part of the Seattle grunge scene and in 1989 they released their debut album Bleach. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers until 1990, when Dave Grohl joined after his former band Scream broke up. After signing with major record label DGC Records, Nirvana released their second studio album Nevermind in 1991. The band achieved worldwide fame through the success of Nevermind and the lead track off the album, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Nirvana released In Utero in 1993, their third studio album, which was also a major success. Nirvana abruptly ended in 1994 following the death of Kurt Cobain. After Nirvana disbanded, Novoselic formed Sweet 75 in 1995 and Eyes Adrift in 2002, releasing one album with each band. From 2006 to 2009, he played in the punk rock band Flipper, and in 2011 he contributed bass and accordion to the song \"I Should Have Known\" on the Foo Fighters' studio album Wasting Light. Since 2017, he has played bass and accordion for the band Giants in the Trees. Outside of music, Novoselic has been active politically, being involved in the formation of a PAC named JAMPAC (Joint Artists and Musicians Political Action Committee). From 2007 through 2010, he wrote a weekly column on music and politics for the Seattle Weekly website. He served on the board of the electoral reform organization FairVote from 2005 to 2019, including 11 years as chair, and in 2020 became board chair of Zócalo Public Square." ;

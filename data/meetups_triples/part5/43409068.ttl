Currently Associate Professor of Jazz Piano at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, he has published both full-length compositions for jazz ensembles and several studio albums. His 2003, 2006, and 2020 releases \"explore jazz-influenced electro-acoustic hybrids.\" He has won a number of songwriting contests, including the Maxell Song of the Year in 2004 for his song \"Bandwidth\", which also won the JLSC's Grand Prize in the Jazz Category. Ensembles such as the Metropole Orkest and conductors such as Vince Mendoza have commissioned pieces by Routenberg, and he has performed at international venues such as the Montreaux Jazz Festival and the North Sea Jazz Festival. Stated jazz violinist Christian Howes, \"Scott Routenberg is a rare musician with both the experience to play modern jazz piano on the highest level and the discipline to write elegant, long-form symphonic pieces.\"" ;

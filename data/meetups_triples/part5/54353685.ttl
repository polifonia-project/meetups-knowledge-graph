        mtp:hasAbstract        "Victoria Wilson-James is an American-born British singer, songwriter and record producer. Born and raised in Gary, Indiana, she performed in various theatre plays and musicals as a teenager. Following the release of her debut single \"I Want You in My Movie\", she was recruited by Jazzie B to join a newly reformed line-up of R&B group Soul II Soul. Managed by her bandmate, Jazzie B, the group became one of London's best-selling groups of all time. Their second album, Vol. II: 1990 â€“ A New Decade (1990), which achieved gold-status in the US and UK, featured the top-charting single \"A Dream's a Dream\" with Wilson-James on lead vocals. Following her exit from the group at the end of 1990, she released her debut solo album, Perseverance (1991), which contained hits \"Through\" and \"Bright Lights\". In 1993, she joined The Shamen and continued performing and recording with them until their disbandment in 1999. In 1997, she released her second album Colorfields, which featured one of her signature hits \"Reach 4 the Melody\". Wilson-James has also appeared in various theatre musicals including The Wiz (2001), Purlie (2004), and Lush Life (2005). She formed a duo called Avitas and released an album called \"A Course in Miracles\" in September 2005. In June 2012, Soul II Soul received the honorary Heritage Award from Performing Right Society, which Wilson-James also received despite not being able to attend. In March 2013, she released her third album titled The Rapture." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tash Sultana (born 15 June 1995) is an Australian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, music producer and engineer, described as a \"one-woman band\". Sultana rose to international prominence with their 2016 single \"Jungle\", which was voted into third place in Triple J's Hottest 100 countdown of 2016. The following year, Sultana had three songs voted into Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2017; \"Mystik\" placing at number 28, \"Murder to the Mind\" at number 43, and their Like a Version cover of MGMT's \"Electric Feel\" at number 78. Sultana grew up in Melbourne, and has been playing guitar from the age of three, beginning a career in music through busking. An active musician on Bandcamp since 2013, Sultana's recordings were viewed millions of times on YouTube in 2016. Sultana's EP, Notion, was released on 23 September 2016, followed by a sold-out world tour in early 2017." ;

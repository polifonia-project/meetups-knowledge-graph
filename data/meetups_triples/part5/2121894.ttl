        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert George Pickett (February 11, 1938 – April 25, 2007), known also by the name Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett, was an American singer, songwriter, actor, and comedian known for co-writing and performing the 1962 hit novelty song \"Monster Mash\". Born in Somerville, Massachusetts, Pickett watched many horror films as a result of his father's position as a local movie theater manager. He started improvising impressions of Hollywood film stars at a young age. At a turning point in his career, Pickett was a vocalist for local swing band Darren Bailes and the Wolf Eaters. He would later serve from 1956–1959 in the United States Army, stationed in Korea for a period of time. He co-wrote his signature song, \"Monster Mash\", with Leonard Capizzi in May 1962 as a spoof of popular contemporary dance crazes. Pickett's performances include impersonations of Boris Karloff (The Mummy (1932)) and Bela Lugosi (Dracula (1931)), and although major labels declined to distribute the song, Gary S. Paxton finally agreed to release it across the United States. \"Monster Mash\" became a million seller and peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in October 1962, including Halloween. The song has since re-charted three more times -- in 1970, 1973 (when it reached the Top Ten) and 2021. Though Pickett never achieved the same success as he did with \"Monster Mash\" on the charts, he continued to lend his voice to further parodies and other songs throughout the rest of his life. Pickett also made appearances as on television, film, and radio as a guest star, narrator, actor, and disc jockey. He released Monster Mash: Half Dead in Hollywood, an autobiography, in 2005. Pickett died of leukemia on April 25, 2007, at age 69." ;

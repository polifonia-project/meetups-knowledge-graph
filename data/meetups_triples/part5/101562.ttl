        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrell D. Rogers (born May 1, 1973), better known as Kilo Ali, formerly Kilo, is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. Kilo Ali recorded mainly bass music (described more closely to Miami bass style music), but also hip-hop tracks with a less distinctive Southern flavor. His most well known singles include \"Show Me Love\", \"Baby Baby\", and \"Love In Ya Mouth\". As Kilo Ali, he released Organized Bass in 1997 on Interscope, with featured artists including George Clinton, Cee-Lo of Goodie Mob, Big Boi of OutKast, and JT Money. In 2011, Ali was released from prison after serving six years of a 15-year sentence for arson. In June 2021, Ali sued rapper NLE Choppa for copyright infringement for unauthorized use of his 1997 song, \"Love In Ya Mouth\"." ;

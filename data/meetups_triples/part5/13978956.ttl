        mtp:hasAbstract        "Noel McKoy (c. 1961 – 3 November 2022) was a British soul music singer. His music was a collection of soul, gospel, funk and Northern soul. McKoy created, produced and presented the Dutch Pot new artist nights in London – which ran for five years. Over 300 artists including Hill St. Soul, Shaun Escoffery, Michael Jackson (writer), and Jeffrey Williams gave early performances at these nights – which proved to be pivotal to their later careers. International names topping the bill included Omar, Lynden David Hall, and Def Jam's Tashan. McKoy cited his influences as The Beatles, Dennis Brown, Chaka Khan, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela." ;

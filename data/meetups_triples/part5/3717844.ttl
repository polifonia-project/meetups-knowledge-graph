        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ken Taylor (born 21 August 1935) is an English former cricketer, who played in three Tests for England from 1959 to 1964. He also played first-class cricket for Yorkshire. He was renowned as a good player of spin and was one of the best cover fielders of his generation, while his medium pace 'darts' broke many a stubborn partnership for his county captains, Vic Wilson and Brian Close. The cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, commented that Taylor was, \"a fine, straight-hitting batsman and brilliant fielder.... yet he never made full use of his bounteous abilities and was affected by nerves when the stakes were high\". Bateman added, \"'A total enigma' was how one former team-mate described him\". He was also a professional footballer in the winter, and later a professional artist." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Allan Jones (born January 14, 1938) is an American singer and actor. Jones is primarily a straight-pop singer (even when he recorded contemporary material) whose forays into jazz are mostly of the big-band/swing variety. He has won two Grammy Awards. Jones continues to perform concerts around the world and remains popular in Las Vegas. He is perhaps most widely known for his recordings of \"Lollipops and Roses\" (1962 Grammy Award, Best Pop Male Performance), \"Wives and Lovers\" (1964 Grammy Award, Best Pop Male Performance), \"The Race Is On\", \"The Impossible Dream\", \"Call Me Irresponsible\", and \"The Love Boat Theme\". He also sang the opening theme tune for the 1968 film Anzio (\"This World Is Yours\")." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Amal Hijazi (Arabic: أمل حجازي; born 20 February 1977) is a Lebanese singer and actress. Hijazi released her debut album, Akher Gharam, in 2001, followed by her second album, Zaman in mid-2002. The latter included four number one hit singles, \"Zaman\", \"Oulhali\", \"Einak\" and \"Romansyia\". Her third album Bedawwar A Albi was released in early 2004 followed by the release of her fourth album Baya al Ward in 2006. The album's opening song of the same name caused some negative publicity and controversy. Hijazi remained at the forefront of pop music with the release of her Gulf single \"Nefsy Tefhamny\" in 2007. She released her fifth studio album, Keef el Amar, in 2008." ;

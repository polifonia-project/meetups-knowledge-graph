He was a member of The Diplomats-affiliated group Purple City and he is the CEO of his label Propain Campain. He was formerly known as 8-Off Agallah. He has ghostwritten songs for many well-known artists. In addition to producing his own music, he also produced tracks for Busta Rhymes, Remy Ma, The Diplomats, Guru, Rockin' Squat, Sean Price, Saigon, Game Theory, PMD, Das Efx, Mobb Deep and Big Pun. In 1995, he finished his debut album, Wrap Your Lips Around This, but it was never properly released because the album was shelved. In 2012, Wrap Your Lips Around This became available for digital download from Amazon.com and iTunes after being unreleased for many years." ;

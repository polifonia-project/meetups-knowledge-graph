        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dave Rodgers (born Giancarlo Pasquini; 21 February 1963) is an Italian singer, songwriter and producer known for his contributions to the Eurobeat genre of dance music. Born in Mantua, Italy, he formed the band Aleph before contributing to the long-running Super Eurobeat series. He owns Rodgers Studio and A-Beat C Productions alongside Alberto Contini. In 2006, he released Blow Your Mind under the Rodgers alias, incorporating rock components in the album. In 2011, he left everything in the hands of Evelin Malferrari. During this time, Malferrari established a new Eurobeat label called Sun Fire Records, where Rodgers helped Malferrari to write a few songs. In 2019, after a long legal battle with Futura Prince, he founded his own label Dave Rodgers Music and started producing a new catalogue, new videos and started collaborating and producing again with many artists like Kaioh, Annerley, Nuage, Domino, Powerful T, Norma Sheffield, Ace Warriors, Mickey B, Go Go Girls, Lou Grant, and Susan Bell. Some of his songs, most notably \"Déjà Vu\", are featured in the anime Initial D, which contributed significantly to the popularity of Eurobeat music. He is also known by the aliases Derek Simon, Robert Stone, Patrick Hoolley, Mario Ross, Red Skins, RCS, Aleph, the Big Brother, and Thomas & Schubert." ;

He creates light, emotional, minimalist soundscapes by combining several styles, and samples from classical, jazz and old television recordings overlaid with instrumental performances by himself and other guest artists. His music has been described by his record label as 'indietronica' and is similar in some ways to Boards of Canada and Iceland's múm." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Avery Sharpe (born August 23, 1954) is an American jazz double-bassist, electric bassist, composer, educator and founder of the artist-owned record label, JKNM Records. Sharpe has a distinguished percussive and rhythmic approach on double bass. He incorporates the Hum-a-long (vocal scatting with the bowed bass) bass technique, popularized by Leroy \"Slam\" Stewart and Major \"Mule\" Holly, into his playing. Sharpe was first bought to prominence by tenor saxophonist Archie Shepp and drummer Art Blakey, but is best known for his longtime association with pianist McCoy Tyner from 1980 to 2003. He recorded more than 20 records with Tyner." ;

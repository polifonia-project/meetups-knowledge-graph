        mtp:hasAbstract        "Carissa Chavval Anderson (born March 2, 1986), known as iRAWniQ (pronounced \"ironic\"), also known as RAW, is a gender-fluid American rapper, singer, songwriter and producer. Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, she started as part of the electro-hiphop duo, Flying Without Wingz, in 2010, releasing five EPS while signing two distribution deals with Shake Your Ass Records as well as Dandy Kid Records. After going solo in 2012, iRAWniQ released her mixtape as Lisa Turtle which featured Grand Hustle production credit from 2BandGeeks and a feature from newly signed Aftermath rapper, Jon Connor. In 2014, iRAWniQ released her EP, No One Said It Would Be Easy, accompanied with three remixes and a visual directed by JB Ghuman Jr. Her latest EP, Black Girls On Skateboards, was released in 2016, selling over 10,000 copies independently via her bandcamp. This project also gave her acclaim in the LGBTQ community, securing her an official SXSW showcase in March. The EP's lead visual, Alien Pu$, also directed by JB Ghuman Jr, featured Tatum O'Neal. The animation was curated by former Disney Animator, Dave Woodman. The visual took over eight months to finish from start to finish and received acclaim from Huffington Post, Vice, and LA Weekly." ;

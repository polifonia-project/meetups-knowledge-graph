        mtp:hasAbstract        "Susan Janet Ballion (born 27 May 1957), known professionally as Siouxsie Sioux, is an English singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. She was the lead singer of the rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees (1976–1996). They released 11 studio albums, and had several UK Top 20 singles including \"Hong Kong Garden\", \"Happy House\" and \"Peek-a-Boo\", plus a US Billboard Top 25 hit, \"Kiss Them for Me\". Siouxsie also formed a second group, the Creatures (1981–2005). With the Creatures she recorded four studio albums and the hit single \"Right Now\". After disbanding the Creatures in the mid-2000s, she has continued as a solo artist, using the name Siouxsie, and released the album Mantaray to critical acclaim in 2007. AllMusic named Siouxsie as \"one of the most influential British singers of the rock era\". Her songs have been covered by Jeff Buckley, Tricky and LCD Soundsystem. Her records have also been praised by artists such as PJ Harvey and TV on the Radio. In 2011, she was awarded for Outstanding Contribution to Music at the Q Awards and in 2012, at the Ivor Novello Awards, she received the Inspiration Award." ;

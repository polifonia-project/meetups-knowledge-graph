        mtp:hasAbstract        "Angeline Ticman Quinto (Tagalog pronunciation: ['kɪntɔ]; born November 26, 1989) is a Filipina singer, actress, entrepreneur and winner of Star Power: Sharon's Search For The Next Female Pop Superstar in 2011. Quinto has been dubbed as the \"Philippines’ Queen of Teleserye and Movie Theme Songs.\" In addition to her six platinum-selling albums and certified-selling singles including Fall in Love Again (2× Platinum), Patuloy ang Pangarap (2× Platinum) and Sana Bukas Pa Ang Kahapon (Gold), she is also recognized as the reigning “Power Diva” of the local music industry for her singing prowess and belting ability. Her self-titled debut album was certified 2× Platinum by PARI and became Astrovision's best-selling album for the first quarter of 2011. The follow-up sophomore album “Fall In Love Again” also became a hit and bagged the number-one spot of Astroplus’ top-selling OPM albums for more than a month, achieving Platinum status in the country. Her third studio album “Higher Love” gained moderate success, becoming the 5th top-selling album of the week. Dubbed as the “Pop Superstar” by media outlets, Manila Bulletin called her as “one of the most important and most bankable musical artists of her generation,” becoming the first artist to stage concert at restored MET Theater. In 2014, she was named (together with Daniel Padilla) as the Pop Artist of the Year by Star Music Awards. In 2022, Quinto received the Outstanding Manilan Award for Entertainment, recognising her contribution to the local entertainment industry. She was a member of two all-female singing quartets, namely, DIVAS along with KZ Tandingan, Yeng Constantino and Kyla and Birit Queens along with Jona, Morissette, and Klarisse de Guzman. She is currently managed by Star Magic and KreativDen, and was formerly managed by Cornerstone Entertainment from 2014 to 2020." ;

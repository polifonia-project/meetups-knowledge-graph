        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrew Roy Gibb (5 March 1958 â€“ 10 March 1988) was an English-Australian singer, songwriter, and actor. He was the younger brother of the Bee Gees: Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb. Gibb came to prominence in the late 1970s through the early 1980s with eight singles reaching the Top 20 of the US Hot 100, three of which went to number-one: \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\" (1977), \"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water\" (1977), and \"Shadow Dancing\" (1978). In the early 1980s, he co-hosted the American music television series Solid Gold. He also performed in a production of The Pirates of Penzance and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Gibb would later have issues with drug addiction and depression. He died on 10 March 1988, five days after his 30th birthday." ;

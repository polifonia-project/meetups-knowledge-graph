He first became popular in the 1980s with his band Dorian Gray, and then soon embarked on a successful solo career. He won five Porin awards for best male vocal performance, 2004–2007, and in 2012. In 2013, Massimo's thirty-year anniversary concert sold out the Pula Arena. It featured Vlado Kreslin, Neno Belan, and Nina Badrić as guests, and was also broadcast live by the Croatian Radiotelevision. He was one of the judges on the second series of X Factor Adria." ;

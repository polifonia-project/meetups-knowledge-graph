        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harmonica Fats (born Harvey Blackston, September 8, 1927 â€“ January 3, 2000) was an American blues harmonica player who was active in the 1950s through to the 1990s. Fats first achieved success with his cover version of the Hank Ballard song \"Tore Up\" in 1962, which established him as an in-demand session and touring musician. He is also remembered for his collaboration with blues guitarist Bernie Pearl, a partnership that resulted in four albums." ;

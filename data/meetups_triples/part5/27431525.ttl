        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gavil치n Rayna Russom known professionally as Rayna Russom, is an American electronic music producer, musician and DJ. Russom has released music under various names, including Black Leotard Front, Black Meteoric Star and The Crystal Ark, as well as collaborative work with Delia Gonzalez and the band LCD Soundsystem. In addition to her musical work, Russom is also a visual artist and a writer. Russom lives in New York City. Central to Russom's aesthetic is the challenge of fixed ideas which surround gender and all of the social frameworks that accompany it. Known in the electronic community as \"The Wizard\" for her technical prowess, she has built instruments for the likes of James Murphy (LCD Soundsystem), Tim Goldsworthy (Unkle, The Loving Hand) and Bjorn Copeland (Black Dice)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jack Owen (born December 6, 1967) is an American guitarist and a member of the death metal band Six Feet Under. He was one of the founding members of Cannibal Corpse. He stayed with the band from their formation in 1988 until 2004 when he left because he wanted to move on, as stated in the Centuries of Torment DVD. Later that year though, he was hired by Deicide—another influential and long-running Florida death metal band—with whom he recorded four albums. He left the band in 2016. In 2007, Owen played shows with Adrift before joining Order of Ennead at times when their guitarist, John Li, was unavailable. In 2009 Owen played guitar for a white power band Attack on their album Fade Away, though he claimed it was merely session work and he was not informed of their racist beliefs beforehand." ;

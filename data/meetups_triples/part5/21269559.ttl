        mtp:hasAbstract        "Axali Doëseb (born 1954) is a Namibian music composer. He wrote and composed \"Namibia, Land of the Brave\", which has been the national anthem of the country since 1991. He has also served as conductor of the Namibian National Symphony Orchestra. The composition of the National anthem was supervised by Hidipo Hamutenya, then chairman of the National Symbols subcommittee. In 2006 Hamutenya claimed that he authored the lyrics himself, \"on the plane to Cuba\", a claim that Doëseb denied." ;

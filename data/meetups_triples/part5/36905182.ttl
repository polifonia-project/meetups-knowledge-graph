        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brooke Dyan Candy (born July 20, 1989) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and tattoo artist. Raised in the suburbs of Los Angeles, daughter of Tom Candy, former CFO of Hustler Magazine, Brooke rose to prominence after starring in Grimes' music video for \"Genesis\" (2012). Following its success, Candy's status in the underground scene rose as she began to release her own material: \"Das Me\" (2012), \"Everybody Does\" (2013), and \"I Wanna Fuck Right Now\" (2013). In 2014, she signed with RCA and released her debut major label single, \"Opulence\", with an accompanying EP of the same name on May 6, 2014. Later, she joined Columbia's UK roster. Both are divisions of Sony Music. Candy's debut album, Daddy Issues, was originally intended for a 2015 release but saw a series of delays. Following a slew of pop-driven singles, including the moderately-successful \"Living Out Loud\" (2017), Candy left the labels in 2017. Throughout 2017 and 2018, she toured alongside Charli XCX and Lizzo, also headlining her own tour, the Tie Me Up Tour (2018), in Asia. Candy released her first full-length album, Sexorcism, in 2019." ;

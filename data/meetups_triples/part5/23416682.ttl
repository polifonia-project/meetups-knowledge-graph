He is best known as the guitarist for The Exploited during their classic lineup of 1979 â€“ 1984. He played and wrote the music for their albums Punks Not Dead, Troops Of Tomorrow and Let's Start a War. He also played and wrote many of their single releases, the most famous being \"Dead Cities\" which they performed on Top of the Pops in 1981. After their American tour in 1983, Duncan quit The Exploited. He then went on to play in several bands including Human Zoo, Crazy Maybe, and Blood Uncles, and then in 1988 joined Goodbye Mr Mackenzie (with future Garbage singer Shirley Manson).

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lazer Lloyd (born Lloyd Paul Blumen; May 7, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Lloyd's music is a mix of acoustic and electric Americana, rock, folk, blues and psychedelic styles with lyrics touching on life, love, and struggle. He performs throughout the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Brazil, both in person and through social media. Born in the United States, Lloyd moved to Israel in his 20s, where he played guitar for the influential Jewish rock band Reva L'Sheva. Following the band's breakup, he fronted the blues rock trio Yood before starting his own solo singer-songwriter career." ;

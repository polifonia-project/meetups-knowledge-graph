        mtp:hasAbstract        "Javon Anthony Jackson (born June 16, 1965) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist, bandleader, and educator. He first became known as a member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers from 1987 until Blakey's death in 1990. and went on to release 22 recordings as a bandleader and tour and record on over 150 CDs with jazz greats including Elvin Jones, Freddie Hubbard, Charlie Haden, Betty Carter, Cedar Walton, Ron Carter, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Stanley Turrentine and Ben E. King. In his solo career, his music has been a mix of tradition and neo-jazz, mixing hard bop with soul and funk influences. Recognized for those diverse styles, he was tapped by producers Lea Reis, Bryant \"Moe Doe\" Johnson to play on Tupac Shakur's Keep Ya Head Up / Madukey Remix in 1993. In 1992, Javon played saxophonist Illinois Jacquet in Spike Lee's Malcolm X. He is featured in the film playing the Lionel Hampton/Benny Goodman standard, \"Flying Home\". He became chair of the University of Hartford's Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz in 2013. In 2019, Newport Festivals Foundation expanded the reach of its popular Newport Jazz Assembly program with the introduction of the Jackie McLean Jazz Studies Jazz Assembly, under Jackson's direction. Jackson also serves as Artistic Director of Jazz in the Valley, an annual music festival in the historic Hudson Valley, now in its 20th year. In a 2006 Toledo Blade feature, Jackson conveyed his motivation for teaching the younger generation of musicians: “[Jackson] said he enjoys teaching because he is able to connect the young students to some of the legends with whom he has played, including Blakey, Freddie Hubbard, and drummer Elvin Jones. ‘We can share our information to those coming behind us and ensure that things will continue on in a certain fashion,’ Jackson said." ;

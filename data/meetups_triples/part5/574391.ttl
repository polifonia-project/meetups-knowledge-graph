        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elaine Iva May (née Berlin; born April 21, 1932) is an American comedian, filmmaker, playwright, and actress. She has received numerous awards including an Oscar, a BAFTA, a Grammy, and a Tony. She made her initial impact in the 1950s with her improvisational comedy routines with Mike Nichols, before transitioning as a groundbreaking film director starting in the 1970s onward. In 1955, May moved to Chicago and became a founding member of the Compass Players, an improvisational theater group. She began working alongside Nichols and in 1957, they both quit the group to form their own stage act, Nichols and May. In New York they performed nightly in clubs in Greenwich Village alongside Joan Rivers and Woody Allen as well as in mostly sold-out shows on the Broadway stage. They also made regular appearances in television and radio broadcasts. They released multiple comedy albums and received four Grammy Award nominations winning Best Comedy Album for An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May in 1962. Their relatively brief time together as comedy stars led New York talk show host Dick Cavett to call their act \"one of the comic meteors in the sky.\" Woody Allen declared, “the two of them came along and elevated comedy to a brand-new level\". Their collaboration was the subject of the PBS documentary for American Masters entitled, Nichols and May: Take Two (1996). Following the end of her performing partnership with Nichols, she starred in films infrequently, including Luv, Enter Laughing (both 1967), and California Suite (1978). May became the first female director with a Hollywood deal since Ida Lupino when she directed the black screwball comedy, A New Leaf (1971) acting opposite Walter Matthau. Experimenting with genres, she regularly broke the mold in directing critically acclaimed films including her dark romantic comedy The Heartbreak Kid, (1972) and the gritty gangster film Mikey and Nicky (1976), and the adventure comedy Ishtar (1987). May received her first Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination for Warren Beatty's comedy Heaven Can Wait (1978). She reunited with Nichols for The Birdcage (1996), and Primary Colors (1998) receiving a Academy Award nomination for the later. In 2013, May received the National Medal of Arts for her lifetime contributions to American comedy, which was presented to her by President Barack Obama. In 2018, May returned to the Broadway stage after a 60-year absence in Lila Neugebauer's revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play The Waverly Gallery which ran at the John Golden Theatre, the same theater where Nichols and May starred almost 60 years prior. May received rapturous reviews for her performance, and won the 2019 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, becoming the second oldest performer to win a Tony Award for acting. In 2022, May was honored by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences by being awarded the Honorary Academy Award for her \"bold, uncompromising approach to filmmaking, as a writer, director, and actress\"." ;

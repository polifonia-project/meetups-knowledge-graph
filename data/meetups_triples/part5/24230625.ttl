        mtp:hasAbstract        "Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu (born 7 November 1988), better known by his stage name Tinie Tempah, is a British rapper. He has been signed to Parlophone Records since 2009, a subsidiary of Warner Music Group. He created his own entertainment company Disturbing London in 2006, along with his cousin Dumi Oburota. After releasing a number of mixtapes, he released his debut album, Disc-Overy, in October 2010. Preceded by two British number-one singles, \"Pass Out\" and \"Written in the Stars\", the album charted at number one and was certified Platinum the next year. In February 2011, he won two Brit Awards for Best British Breakthrough Act and Best British Single. In November 2013, he released his second album, entitled Demonstration. Preceded by top ten singles \"Trampoline\" and \"Children of the Sun\", the album charted at number three and was certified gold by the BPI the next year. In June 2015, he released \"Not Letting Go\", the first single from his third album Youth. This gave Tinie his sixth UK number one, surpassing Dizzee Rascal as the most by any UK rap artist." ;

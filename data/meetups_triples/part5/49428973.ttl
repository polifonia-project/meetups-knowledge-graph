        mtp:hasAbstract        "Geraldine Connor, PhD, MMus, LRSM, DipEd (22 March 1952 â€“ 21 October 2011), was a British ethnomusicologist, theatre director, composer and performer, who spent significant periods of her life in Trinidad and Tobago, from where her parents had migrated to Britain in the 1940s. Her father was actor, singer and folklorist Edric Connor and her mother was theatrical agent and cultural activist Pearl Connor. Geraldine Connor is best known for having written, composed and directed Carnival Messiah, a spectacular work that \"married the European classical tradition of oratorio with masquerade and musical inspiration from the African diaspora\". For more than 20 years, she lived in Skelmanthorpe in Yorkshire, where she went in 1990 as a lecturer at the University of Leeds." ;

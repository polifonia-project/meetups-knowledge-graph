        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lanre Dabiri (born May 23, 1977), better known by his stage name Eldee, stylized as eLDee, is a retired Nigerian-American rapper, singer, and record producer based in the United States. He is a member of the band Trybesmen, which was started in 1998 with rappers KB and Freestyle. He has made five solo albums. In 2019, he said he does not regret quitting music as the path his career was going would not make him have time for his family. On 1 October 2016, Netng longlisted him on its list of 56 greatest Nigerian entertainers of all time, for his contribution towards the music industry, and for founding the first official Nigeria airplay chart, known as Playdata, for monitoring music consumption on radio." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yuri Sergeevich Sakhnovsky (Russian: Ю́рий Серге́евич Сахно́вский) (1866–1930) was a Russian composer, conductor and music critic. Sakhnovsky came from a well-off family and was known as a \"bon vivant (he weighed 260.lbs) handsome, brilliant and wealthy\". Sakhnovsky studied chant with Stepan Vasilevich Smolensky, to whom Sergei Rachmaninoff dedicated his Vespers, though Sakhnovsky later turned to a more \"lush\" style of choral writing. While a student Sakhnovsky took in his eight-year younger fellow student Rachmaninoff during the difficult winter when it seemed he was suffering from malaria. In later life Sakhnovsky was active more as a critic than a composer. Particularly notorious were his attacks on Alexander Scriabin's music as \"decadent\" from 1911-1914. His song \"The Blacksmith\" was recorded by Maxim Mikhailov and his song \"The Clock\" was recorded by Vladimir Rosing." ;

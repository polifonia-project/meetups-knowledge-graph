        mtp:hasAbstract        "Vesta Victoria (born Victoria Lawrence, 26 November 1873 â€“ 7 April 1951) was an English music hall singer and comedian. She was famous for her performances of songs such as \"Waiting at the Church\" and \"Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow\", both of which were written specially for her. Vesta's comic laments delivered in deadpan style were even more popular in the USA: she was, at the beginning of the twentieth century, one of the most successful British entertainers in America." ;

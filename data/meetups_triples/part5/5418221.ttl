        mtp:hasAbstract        "Irene Scharrer (2 February 1888 – 11 January 1971) was an English classical pianist. Irene Scharrer was born in London and studied at the Royal Academy of Music with Tobias Matthay. She made her London début at the age of 16, and gave concerts regularly until June 1958, where she appeared for the last time, playing Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos with Myra Hess. They often performed four-handed compositions together. Scharrer is sometimes erroneously described as Hess's cousin. She was distantly related to another fine woman pianist, Harriet Cohen, the two sharing a great-great-grandfather. Other collaborators included Arthur Nikisch in Berlin, and Landon Ronald in London. She visited Sir Edward Elgar in 1918 and was promised the first performance of his piano concerto, then being sketched." ;

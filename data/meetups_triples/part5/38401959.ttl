        mtp:hasAbstract        "Petra Collins (born December 21, 1992) is a Canadian artist, director of photography, fashion model and actress who rose to prominence in the early 2010s. Her photography is characterized by a feminine, dreamlike feel, informed in part by a female gaze approach. She was a resident photographer for Rookie magazine and a casting agent for Richard Kern. She has also directed a number of short films, including music videos for Carly Rae Jepsen, Lil Yachty, Selena Gomez, Cardi B, and Olivia Rodrigo. She directed the music video for Rodrigo's song \"Good 4 U\", which as of January 2022 has amassed over 300 million views on YouTube. In 2016, Collins was chosen as a face of Gucci. She has been labeled an \"it girl\" by photographer and mentor Ryan McGinley and by Vanity Fair and The New Yorker magazines." ;

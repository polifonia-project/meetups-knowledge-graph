        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Patrick Masterson (born October 13, 1974), known professionally as Jipsta, is an American rapper, songwriter, and music producer. Jipsta has released six studio albums: Bandoozle (2011), Turnt Up (2013), Ban2oozle (2017), \"Swaggerific\" (2019),\"Year of the Tiger\" (2021), and most recently \"ORIGAMI\"(2022). Jipsta's unique style of layering intricate lyrics over uptempo house music beats has resulted in seven consecutive appearances on the Billboard Dance Club Songs Chart since 2007 when his debut single \"Don't Act Like You Don't Know\" was released. Jipsta is also widely known for his genre-bending cover songs; the most popular of which is his cover version of \"I Want Your Sex\" by George Michael which reached No. 4 on the Billboard Dance Chart in 2009. Jipsta's notoriety increased significantly when he was asked to collaborate with RuPaul on the song \"Sexy Drag Queen,\" which was heard regularly on the television program Rupaul's Drag Race. Jipsta is an openly gay member of the LGBTQ community." ;

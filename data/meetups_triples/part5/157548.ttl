        mtp:hasAbstract        "Allan Sherman (born Allan Copelon; November 30, 1924 â€“ November 20, 1973) was an American musician, satirist and television producer who became known as a song parodist in the early 1960s. His first album, My Son, the Folk Singer (1962), became the fastest-selling record album up to that time. His biggest hit was \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\", a comic song in which a boy describes his summer camp experiences to the tune of Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours." ;

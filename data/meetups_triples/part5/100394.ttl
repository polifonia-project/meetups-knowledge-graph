        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ethel Merman (born Ethel Agnes Zimmermann, January 16, 1908 – February 15, 1984) was an American actress and singer, known for her distinctive, powerful voice, and for leading roles in musical theatre. She has been called \"the undisputed First Lady of the musical comedy stage\". Over her distinguished career in theater she became known for her performances in shows such as Anything Goes, Annie Get Your Gun, Gypsy, and Hello, Dolly! She is also known for her film roles in Anything Goes (1936), Call Me Madam (1953), There's No Business Like Show Business (1954), and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). Among many accolades, she received the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance in Call Me Madam, a Grammy Award for Gypsy and Drama Desk Award for Hello, Dolly! Among the many standards introduced by Merman in Broadway musicals are \"I Got Rhythm\" (from Girl Crazy); \"Everything's Coming Up Roses\", \"Some People\", and \"Rose's Turn\" (from Gypsy—Merman starred as Rose in the original 1959 Broadway production); and the Cole Porter songs \"It's De-Lovely\" (from Red, Hot and Blue), \"Friendship\" (from Du Barry Was a Lady), and \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"You're the Top\", and \"Anything Goes\" (from Anything Goes). The Irving Berlin song \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", written for the musical Annie Get Your Gun, became Merman's signature song." ;

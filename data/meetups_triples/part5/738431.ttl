        mtp:hasAbstract        "Matthew David Cameron (born November 28, 1962) is an American musician who is the drummer for the rock band Pearl Jam. He first gained fame as the drummer for Seattle-based rock band Soundgarden, which he joined in 1986. He appeared on each of the band's studio albums until its break-up in 1997. In 1998, Cameron was invited to join Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour and then became a permanent member of the band. In 2010, Cameron became simultaneously a member of Pearl Jam and the reunited Soundgarden. He remained with Soundgarden until its disbandment after the death of lead singer Chris Cornell in 2017. Cameron, along with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell, is one of three members to feature on every Soundgarden studio album. Additionally, Cameron was a member of Temple of the Dog (with fellow Soundgarden and Pearl Jam bandmates) and has served as the drummer for the side project bands Nighttime Boogie Association, Hater and Wellwater Conspiracy, also acting as the lead singer for the latter. Prior to joining Soundgarden, Cameron was a member of the Seattle rock bands Bam Bam and Skin Yard. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked Cameron 52nd on its list of the \"100 Greatest Drummers of All Time\". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl Jam on April 7, 2017. Cameron has won two Grammy Awards as a member of Soundgarden." ;

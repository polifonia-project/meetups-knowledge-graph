He also works as an illustrator, sculptor and writing coach. His real name is Thijs van Ebbenhorst Tengbergen.

To date, Tais Teng has written more than a hundred novels both for adults and children in the Dutch language. He has won the Paul Harland Prize four times. His books have been translated in German, Finnish, French and English. Tais Teng is a bilingual writer and writes in both Dutch and English. He likes to work together with other writers and has co authored short stories and novels with Paul Harland, Eddy C. Bertin, , , and ." ;

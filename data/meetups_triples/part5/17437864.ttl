She has performed internationally, including invitational appearances with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and renowned conductor Chung Myung-Whun.

Kawai has recorded numerous CDs and performance videos which have been released both in Japan and internationally. In addition to her work as a classical artist, she has worked in popular music with American artists of different genres, including Sheila E. and the Gipsy Kings. She has also appeared as an actress in a Japanese television series. In honor of her artistry, Kawai has been loaned the use of the University's 1715 Stradivarius violin. (The 1715 Stradivarius is known as one of the greatest works of Antonio Stradivari's \"golden period\".) She has also played a Francesco Ruggieri violin which was also loaned by Osaka University. Formerly, she played the Guarneri del Gesu (Muntz), loaned in grandis agnitio from the Nippon Foundation." ;

His first professional work was in 1984 with the MCA band Hanover Fist from Toronto, Canada, after which he recorded and toured with other bands, playing many styles of music in western New York state. Between 1987 and 1997, he was based in Los Angeles and worked with various virtuoso guitarists, including Yngwie Malmsteen, Tony Macalpine, and Steve Lukather, and bands like Kuni and Beau Nasty.

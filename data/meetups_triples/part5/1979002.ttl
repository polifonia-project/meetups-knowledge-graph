        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cristina Monet Zilkha (née Monet-Palaci, January 17, 1956 – March 31, 2020), known during her recording career simply as Cristina, was an American singer and writer, best known for her no wave recordings made for ZE Records in the late 1970s and early 1980s in New York City. She \"was a pioneer in blending the artsiness and attitude of punk with the joyful energy of disco and pop.... [which] helped pave the way for the massive successes of her contemporaries, like Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, and anticipated the rise of confrontational but danceable alt-pop acts...\" in a mode that was at once \"campy, self-aware, and infectious.\"" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Winfield Scott Moore III (December 27, 1931 â€“ June 28, 2016) was an American guitarist who formed The Blue Moon Boys in 1954, Elvis Presley's backing band. He was studio and touring guitarist for Presley between 1954 and 1968. Rock critic Dave Marsh credits Moore with inventing power chords, on the 1957 Elvis hit \"Jailhouse Rock\", the intro of which Moore and drummer D.J. Fontana, according to the latter, \"copped from a '40s swing version of 'The Anvil Chorus\".\" Moore was ranked 29th in Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time in 2011. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007, and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015. Rolling Stones' lead guitarist Keith Richards said of Moore: When I heard \"Heartbreak Hotel\", I knew what I wanted to do in life. It was as plain as day. All I wanted to do in the world was to be able to play and sound like the way Scotty Moore did. Everyone wanted to be Elvis, I wanted to be Scotty." ;

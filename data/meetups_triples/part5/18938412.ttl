Marx's self-titled debut album went triple-platinum in 1987, and his first single, \"Don't Mean Nothing\", reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Between 1987 and 1994, he had 14 top 20 hits, including three number one singles. Marx is the only male artist in history to have his first seven singles reach the top 5 of the Billboard charts. He has scored a total of 14 number one singles, both as a performer and as a songwriter/producer. As a singer, his No. 1 hits include \"Right Here Waiting\", \"Hold On to the Nights\", \"Endless Summer Nights\", and \"Satisfied\". According to Billboard, Marx \"holds the distinction of having written songs that have hit No. 1 on various Billboard charts in each of the last four decades.\" Marx has written or collaborated on songs with other artists, including \"This I Promise You\" by NSYNC and \"Dance with My Father\" by Luther Vandross. Marx has been nominated for five Grammy Awards. In 2003, he won the Grammy for Song of the Year for \"Dance with My Father\". Marx's first number one success came in 1984 with \"What About Me?\" which was recorded by Kenny Rogers, Kim Carnes, and James Ingram. His second chart-topper was 1985's \"Crazy\", a song he co-wrote with country music superstar Kenny Rogers." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Agnes Monica Muljoto (born 1 July 1986), known professionally as Agnez Mo (stylized as all caps), is an Indonesian singer and actress. She was professionally known as Agnes Monica before amending her stage name. As a bilingual singer who records in Indonesian and English, she is known for her image reinventions and musical versatility throughout her career. Prior to recording three children's albums and presenting several children's television programs, Agnes Monica began as a worship singer at a church in Jakarta, Indonesia. She released her first teen album entitled And the Story Goes in 2003, which catapulted her name in Indonesian music industry. Her success in her homeland encouraged her to target the international music industry. She has since collaborated with American musicians, such as Timbaland, Michael Bolton, Keith Martin, T.I., Chris Brown, French Montana, and Steve Aoki. Mo is the most awarded artist in the history of Indonesia with over 190 awards, including 18 Anugerah Musik Indonesia, 8 Panasonic Awards, 5 Nickelodeon Indonesia Kidsâ€™ Choice Awards, 4 MTV Indonesia Awards, 2 Mnet Asian Music Awards, 1 World Music Awards, and 1 iHeartRadio Music Awards. Mo is an anti-drug ambassador in Asia and the ambassador of MTV EXIT in combating human trafficking. Mo has also claimed the title of entrepreneur, showcasing her own fashion line ANYE, APP, Digital Marketplace, and partnering with cell phone manufacturer Vivo to create her own limited-edition line of devices. Mo will be immortalized through a wax statue at the Madame Tussauds Museum in Singapore, and thus becoming the first Indonesian celebrity to have a wax statue made there." ;

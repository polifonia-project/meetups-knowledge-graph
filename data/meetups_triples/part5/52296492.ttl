        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alex Cameron (born 11 September 1988) is an Australian singer-songwriter from Sydney. He is best known for his solo career, a high-concept act in which Cameron initially adopted the persona of a failed entertainer. During live performances, Cameron is often joined by saxophonist and \"business partner\", Roy Molloy. Before making music under his own name, Cameron was also a member of the electronica act Seekae, releasing three studio albums with them. Cameron independently released his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website in 2013. In 2016, Secretly Canadian reissued the album to a wider audience and growing cult fanbase. In 2017, Cameron released his second studio album, Forced Witness, featuring contributions from Molloy, Flowers, Olsen and Jonathan Rado. His third studio album, Miami Memory, was released in September 2019. His fourth studio album, Oxy Music, was released in March 2022." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Pearce (born 29 May 1978) is an English singer, songwriter and actor who was a finalist on the ITV reality TV show Popstars: The Rivals. He won a place in the British boy band One True Voice, who subsequently released two top ten singles, \"Sacred Trust\"/\"After You're Gone\" and \"Shakespeare's (Way With) Words\". Pearce, an arranger and co-writer of some of their songs, left the group in summer 2003, shortly before the band split up. In September 2009, he auditioned for the 2009 series of The X Factor, but failed to progress as far as the live finals. In 2010, he returned as backing vocalist on a hit entitled \"Dirtee Disco\", a UK No. 1 single by Dizzee Rascal, featuring Pearce. Since 2011, he has provided vocals and percussion for the English funk band Shuffler. In 2014, Pearce provided lead vocals for \"Nobody to Love\", the UK number-one single from DJs Sigma." ;

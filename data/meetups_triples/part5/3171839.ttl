        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dana Strum (born Dana Strumwasser on December 13, 1957) is an American musician whose career spans over 45 years. He is best known as a co-founder, bass player, and one of the two primary songwriters of the US-based hard rock band Slaughter, an American Music Awards winner, formed in 1988. He first achieved fame as a member of an ex-Kiss guitarist act, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, along with his future Slaughter bandmate Mark Slaughter. Strum, who was in Los Angeles at the time, developed a reputation for finding new talented musicians, claiming responsibility for introducing the legendary guitarist Randy Rhoads to Ozzy Osbourne, as well as bringing Jake E. Lee to Ozzy's solo band following Rhoads's tragic death. Throughout his career, from mid-80s to the present day, Dana Strum has worked with a number of artists and groups, playing bass, co-writing, and/or producing songs, such as The Beach Boys, DÃ©tente, Sweet Savage, Ace Frehley, Kik Tracee, Dennis Bono, Vince Neil, and Ozzy Osbourne, among others." ;

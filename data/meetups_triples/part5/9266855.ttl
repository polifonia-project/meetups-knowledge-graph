A musician himself, Kofsky also wrote several books on jazz, mainly concentrating on the avant-garde of the 1960s and the relationship between musicians and the industry on which they depend. In the liner notes for the Impulse! release of The John Coltrane Quartet Plays (A(S)-85), Kofsky gives an analysis on the transition from bop to the avant garde as it relates to Coltrane's career." ;

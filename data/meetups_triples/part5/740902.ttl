        mtp:hasAbstract        "Matt Monro (born Terence Edward Parsons, 1 December 1930 â€“ 7 February 1985) was an English singer. Known as \"The Man with the Golden Voice\", he performed internationally during his 30-year career. AllMusic has described Monro as \"one of the most underrated pop vocalists of the '60s\", who \"possessed the easiest, most perfect baritone in the business\". His recordings include the UK Top 10 hits: \"Portrait of My Love\", \"My Kind of Girl\", \"Softly As I Leave You\", \"Walk Away\" and \"Yesterday\" (originally by The Beatles). He also recorded several film themes such as \"From Russia with Love\" for the eponymous James Bond film, \"Born Free\" for the eponymous film and \"On Days Like These\" for The Italian Job." ;

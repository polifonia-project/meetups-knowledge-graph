        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ralph Joseph \"Jody\" Reynolds (December 3, 1932 â€“ November 7, 2008) was an American rock and roll singer, guitarist, and songwriter whose song \"Endless Sleep\" was a major U.S. top-ten hit in the summer of 1958. His follow-up single, \"Fire of Love\", peaked at only No. 66 on the Billboard chart, but the song went on to become a blues-punk classic after being covered by the MC5 and the Gun Club. Reynolds was a regular on the \"oldies\" circuit and a successful businessman in the U.S. Southwest. Beginning in the 1980s several compilations of his music were issued in the U.S. and Europe, and he enjoyed modest acclaim as a pioneer of rockabilly music. In 1999, Reynolds was honored with both a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, California, and induction into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame." ;

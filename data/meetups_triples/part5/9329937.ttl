        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hans-Jörgen Holman (20 February 1925 – 6 August 1986) (also Hans-Jörgen Holmen-Guttormsen) was a Norwegian-American pianist/ harpsichordist and professor of music at Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan. Holman specialized in Medieval and Renaissance music, and his 1961 Indiana University doctoral dissertation The Responsoria Prolixa of the Codex Worcester F 160 is considered one of the principal authoritative works on the vocal music of the medieval church. One of the first musicologists to pioneer computer aided big-data studies, Holman built a database of 48.000 melodic phrases from European and Scandinavian sources in order to trace melodic migration and development. He was particularly interested in questions concerning the relationship between the religious vocal folk music of Norway and the liturgical music of the medieval church. Holman gave papers on topics of musicology at several international conferences and made contributions to the Harvard Dictionary of Music." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Silvana Bajraktarević (born Zilha Bajraktarević; 18 February 1939 – 10 October 1976), known professionally as Silvana Armenulić (pronounced [silvǎːna armɛ̌nulit͡ɕ]), was a Bosnian singer-songwriter and actress and one of the most prominent commercial folk music and traditional sevdalinka singers in Yugoslavia. She is called the \"Queen of Sevdalinka\". Her life was cut short when she died in a car crash at the age of 37, but she continues to be well regarded in the region and she is recognized for her unique singing style and voice. Armenulić's song \"Šta će mi život\" (What Do I Need a Life for), written by her friend and contemporary Toma Zdravković, is one of the best-selling singles from the former Yugoslavia. Two of her sisters were also professional singers: Mirsada \"Mirjana\" Bajraktarević and Hajrudina \"Dina\" Bajraktarević." ;

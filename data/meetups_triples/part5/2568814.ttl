        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian Ebejer (born March 21, 1974), known professionally as Edsel Dope, is an American musician who is the lead singer, rhythm guitarist and main songwriter for nu metal/industrial metal band Dope. Dope was founded in 1997 by Edsel and his brother Simon (keyboards) in New York City. Edsel co-produced all of Dope's albums. On Felons and Revolutionaries, Dope's first album released in 1999, Edsel played and programmed most of the musical instruments. In 2019, a new lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist joined Static-X under the moniker Xer0, which led to speculation and rumors that it was Edsel Dope. Edsel has denied that he is Xer0." ;

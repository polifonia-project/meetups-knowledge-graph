In the late 1960s, he began his professional career in The Maze, formerly MI5, after which he was a member of the original Deep Purple line-up, who produced three studio albums with a more progressive and pop-driven sound. After recording a solo single, he was a member of the original Captain Beyond line-up that produced two studio albums. Following a legal battle with Deep Purple in 1980, Evans turned reclusive and disappeared from public life." ;

A 1925 graduate of Trinity College, he hosted a jazz radio program on WTIC-FM in Hartford, Connecticut for many years. He wrote eight humorous novels, most with \"salty pictures by Carl Rose.\" His first novel was adapted into a Broadway musical in 1945 entitled Are You With It?. The musical was in turn adapted into a 1948 film. He collected a large number of items related to jazz, which were given to the Watkinson Library at Trinity College after his death as dictated in his will." ;

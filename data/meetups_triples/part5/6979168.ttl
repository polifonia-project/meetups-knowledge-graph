He used multiple aliases in the past and was part of many other acts such as Tilt, Whiteroom, Leama & Moor, and Zoo DJs. Moor received several awards, including a Grammy Award nomination in December 2007, for his remix of Canadian artist Delerium with \"Angelicus\" featuring vocals from Isabel Bayrakdarian, ‘Best Dance Record,’ at the 2006 International Dance Music Awards at the Winter Music Conference in Miami and, ‘Best Trance Producer’ and ‘Best Trance Track’ at the ‘Trance Awards’\" in 2004, ranked in the top 15 DJs in the world numerous times by DJ Mag with a vast and loyal following. Moor is known for production techniques such as vocal chops and syncopated bass lines. Andy Moor's sound is described as finely tuned, melodic soundscapes floating above prominent, clever bass lines. Moor is best known for his own style of progressive trance, but also produced music in other genres. He also remixed tracks for major artists, including Paul Oakenfold, Brian Eno, Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Britney Spears and Arthur Baker." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark \"Gersh\" Gersmehl (born July 29, 1954) is a contemporary Christian musician who is best known as one of the founding members of the Christian rock group White Heart. He and guitarist Billy Smiley were the only two original members of the band to stay with White Heart from its conception in 1982 through its disbandment in 1998. Gersmehl played keyboards in the band, as well as occasionally singing lead vocals. He also contributed his songwriting skills, penning 15 of White Heart's 16 No. 1 hits. When the group disbanded in 1998, he began a solo career, releasing his first solo album in 2002." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sydney Nathan (April 27, 1904 â€“ March 5, 1968) was an American music business executive who founded King Records, a leading independent record label, in 1943. He contributed to the development of country & western music, rhythm and blues and rock and roll and is credited with discovering many prominent musicians, most notably James Brown, whose first single, \"Please, Please, Please\", was released by Federal Records, a subsidiary of King, in 1956. Nathan was described as \"One of the truly eccentric figures of the record industry ... [who] ruled his label like a dictator ... [and] constantly screamed and intimidated his artists and employees\". He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in the non-performer category, in 1997." ;

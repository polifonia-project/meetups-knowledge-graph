        mtp:hasAbstract        "Babs Gonzales (October 27, 1919 â€“ January 23, 1980), born Lee Brown, was an American bebop vocalist, poet, and self-published author. His books portrayed the jazz world that many black musicians struggled in, portraying disk jockeys, club owners, liquor, drugs, and racism. \"There are jazz people whose influence can be described as minor,\" wrote Val Wilmer, \"yet who are well-known to musicians and listeners alike ... You'd have to be hard-pressed to ignore the wealth of legend that surrounds Babs Gonzales.\" Jazz writer Jack Cooke explained that Gonzales \"assumed the role of spokesman for the whole hipster world... [becoming] something more than just a good and original jazz entertainer: the incarnation of a whole social group.\"" ;

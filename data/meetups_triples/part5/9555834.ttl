        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yuridia Valenzuela Canseco, commonly known as Yuri, (born, 6 January 1964) is a Mexican singer, actress and television host. Yuri began her career as a teenage singer in her native country. In 1978 she released her first album titled TÃº Iluminas mi Vida. She gained recognition as a result of her participation in the Oti Festival in 1980. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Yuri established herself as one of the most popular pop music singers in Mexico and Latin America. Her vocal quality and versatility allow her to be incorporated into other musical genres, ranging from pop to dance, ranchera and tropical music genres. Thanks to her success and influence, she came to be considered the \"Queen of Latin Pop\". In the mid-1990s, Yuri put a pause on her musical career and during some years she dedicated herself to the interpretation and preaching of Christian music and gospel. In 2002, she returns to commercial music with much greater impact than her first season as a pop singer. Since the mid-2000s and during this decade, Yuri has established herself as one of the most successful interpreters of Spanish music. She has released a total of 29 studio albums and has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. Parallel to her role as a singer, Yuri has also ventured into acting. She has participated in some telenovelas and films and has served as a host in some television shows in her native country. In 2018, the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences honored Yuri with a Grammy for musical excellence." ;

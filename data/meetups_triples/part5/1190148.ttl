        mtp:hasAbstract        "Esham is an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan. Esham released his debut studio album, Boomin' Words from Hell, in 1989. Since then, he has gone on to release 15 studio albums in total and is best known as a representative of the hip hop subgenres horrorcore and rap rock. In 1992, he co-founded the horrorcore group Natas. He and his brother James Smith founded and ran the Detroit hip hop label Reel Life Productions. As one of the first rappers to receive attention in the city, Esham was often cited as a major influence on another Detroit horrorcore act, Insane Clown Posse. Esham is known for incorporating elements of rock music in his beats, and his lyrics cover a number of subjects, including death, drug use, evil, paranoia and sex. Esham refers to his style of music as \"acid rap\"." ;

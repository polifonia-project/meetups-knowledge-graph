        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Reese Perkins (July 22, 1924 – August 10, 2003) was an American cool jazz saxophonist and flutist, popular on the West Coast jazz scene, known primarily as a tenor saxophonist. Born in San Francisco, California, United States, Perkins started performing in the big bands of Woody Herman and Jerry Wald. He worked for the Stan Kenton orchestra, which led to his entry into the cool jazz idiom. He began performing with Art Pepper and Bud Shank. He was also a member of The Tonight Show Band from 1970–1992 and The Lighthouse All-Stars. In the 1960s, Perkins had a second career as a recording engineer. He died of cancer in his Sherman Oaks home at the age of 79." ;

She signed a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment in 2012, releasing her debut extended play, Bikini Daze (2013), and her debut studio album, No Mythologies to Follow (2014). MØ collaborated with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea on the 2014 single \"Beg for It\", which peaked at number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100, earning MØ her first entry on the chart. The following year, she co-wrote and provided vocals for the Major Lazer and DJ Snake collaboration \"Lean On\", which became an international success, charting at number one in several countries, number two in the United Kingdom, and number four in the United States. In 2016, MØ was featured on Snakehips's single \"Don't Leave\", and another Major Lazer single \"Cold Water\" with Canadian singer Justin Bieber, which debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. MØ earned her first commercially successful solo single with 2016's \"Final Song\".

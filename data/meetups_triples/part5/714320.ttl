He was nominated for the best original song Oscar nine times in 11 years, including five consecutive years between 1940 and 1944, and won the award once, for \"You'll Never Know\". That song has proved among his most enduring, and remains popular in films and television commercials to this day. \"At Last\" is another of his best-known songs." ;

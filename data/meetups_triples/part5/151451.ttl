        mtp:hasAbstract        "Trevor George Smith Jr. (born May 20, 1972), known professionally as Busta Rhymes, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. Chuck D of Public Enemy gave him the moniker Busta Rhymes, after NFL and CFL wide receiver George \"Buster\" Rhymes. He has received 12 Grammy Award nominations for his work, making him one of the most-nominated artists without winning. Busta Rhymes was an original member of Leaders of the New School, a group that attracted national attention when they opened on tour for Public Enemy. He gained exposure for his guest appearance on A Tribe Called Quest's track \"Scenario\". Shortly thereafter, the group broke up, leading Rhymes to become a sought after solo artist, appearing on numerous tracks for other artists before his solo debut album, The Coming (1996). The album reached the top ten on the Billboard 200 album chart, was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and earned him a Grammy nomination. He has released nine total solo albums, with the most recent being 2020's Extinction Level Event 2: The Wrath of God. Rhymes' list of hit singles include \"Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check\", \"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See\", \"Dangerous\", \"Turn It Up\" (Remix)/\"Fire It Up\", \"Gimme Some More\", \"What's It Gonna Be?\", \"Pass the Courvoisier, Part II\", \"I Know What You Want\" and \"Touch It\". Among his other ventures, he founded the record label Conglomerate (initially Flipmode Entertainment) and the production crew The Conglomerate (formerly Flipmode Squad). About.com included him on its list of the 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987â€“2007), while Steve Huey of AllMusic called him one of the best and most prolific rappers of the 1990s. In 2012, The Source placed him on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time. MTV has called him \"one of hip-hop's greatest visual artists\"." ;

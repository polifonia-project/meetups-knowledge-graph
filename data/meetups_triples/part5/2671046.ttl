        mtp:hasAbstract        "Henry Thomas (1874â€“1930?) was an American country blues singer, songster and musician. Although his recording career, in the late 1920s, was brief, Thomas influenced performers including Bob Dylan, Taj Mahal, The Lovin' Spoonful, The Grateful Dead, and Canned Heat. Often billed as \"Ragtime Texas\", Thomas's style is an early example of what later became known as Texas blues guitar." ;

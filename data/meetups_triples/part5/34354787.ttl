He initially came to widespread public attention at 17 through a YouTube video, \"Pop Culture\", where he performed a mash-up of 39 different popular songs in real-time using a Novation Launchpad. It received millions of hits in its first few days of release. Madeon has cited The Beatles and Daft Punk as his greatest musical influences. Madeon's first EP, The City, was released in 2012.

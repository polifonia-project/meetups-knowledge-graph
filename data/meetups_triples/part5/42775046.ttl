        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zohrabai Ambalewali (1918 â€“ 21 February 1990) was an Indian classical singer and playback singer in Hindi cinema in the 1930s and 1940s. She was considered one of the most popular female playback singers of early and mid 1940s. She is best known for her contralto or low voice range singing in the film songs, \"Ankhiyan Milake Jiyaa Bharmaake\" and \"Aai Diwali, Aai Diwali\" in 1944 hit Rattan (1944), with music by Naushad, and \"Uran Khatole Pe Ud Jaoon\", duet with Shamshad Begum in Anmol Ghadi (1946), also under Naushad's music direction. She, along with Rajkumari, Shamshad Begum and Amirbai Karnataki, were amongst the leading first generation of playback singers in the Hindi film industry. However, by the late 1940s, the arrival of new voices like Geeta Dutt and Lata Mangeshkar, meant Zohrabai Ambalewali's career faded away." ;

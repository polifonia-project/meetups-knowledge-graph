Best known for founding and leading Edmund Welles, the only bass clarinet quartet in the world, he now mainly plays and composes for the shakuhachi flute. He received his shakuhachi master teachingâ€™s license (Shihan) from Grand Master Michael Chikuzen Gould in 2013. He has recorded five albums and performs internationally. He played on stage during Sony's E3 2018 conference, prior to the reveal of Ghost of Tsushima, a samurai-based video game. Boots mostly plays taimu shakuhachi, which are long, wide-bore flutes noted for their deep tones." ;

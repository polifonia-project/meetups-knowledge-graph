        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Alexander Aberle (April 15, 1908 â€“ March 4, 1995), known as eden ahbez, was an American songwriter and recording artist of the 1940s to 1960s, whose lifestyle in California was influential in the hippie movement. He was known to friends simply as ahbe. Ahbez composed the song \"Nature Boy\", which became a No. 1 hit for eight weeks in 1948 for Nat \"King\" Cole. Living a bucolic life from at least the 1940s, he traveled in sandals and wore shoulder-length hair and beard, and white robes. He camped out below the first L in the Hollywood Sign above Los Angeles and studied Oriental mysticism. He slept outdoors with his family and ate vegetables, fruit, and nuts. He claimed to live on three dollars per week." ;

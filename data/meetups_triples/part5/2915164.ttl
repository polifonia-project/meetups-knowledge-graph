        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sara Dylan (born Shirley Marlin Noznisky; October 28, 1939) is an American former actress and model who was the first wife of singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In 1959, Noznisky was wed to magazine photographer Hans Lownds, during which time she was known as Sara Lownds. She was married to Bob Dylan from 1965 until their 1977 divorce; they had four children together, and he adopted her daughter from her first marriage. Their marriage has been cited by music writers and biographers as the inspiration for many songs Dylan created during the 1960s and '70s, and the 1975 album Blood on the Tracks has been cited by many as Dylan's account of their disintegrating marriage. Sara Dylan played the role of Clara in the movie Renaldo and Clara, directed by Dylan, and the film was described by a Dylan biographer as \"in part a tribute to his wife\"." ;

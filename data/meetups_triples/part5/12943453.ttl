        mtp:hasAbstract        "Horst Liepolt (27 July 1927 â€“ 9 January 2019) was a jazz producer and artist. In Australia, and later in the United States, he organized numerous successful jazz concerts and festivals and also produced a large number of jazz recordings. In Australia he originated the long-running Manly Jazz Festival and jazz at the Festival of Sydney, booked bands for The Basement (Sydney's top jazz club of the 1970s) and presented a number of concerts under his banner of Music Is An Open Sky. His \"44\" recording label featured some of Australia's top jazz musicians and was representative of many of the Australian jazz groups that were active in the 1970s. His two New York jazz clubs Sweet Basil and Lush Life presented a number of well-established jazz musicians during the 1980s and early 1990s. He produced over 48 jazz recordings by high-profile US musicians including the Grammy Award winning album Bud and Bird by Gil Evans." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mitchell Joseph Torok (born October 28, 1929) is an American country music singer-songwriter, guitarist, artist and author, best known for his 1953 hit record \"Caribbean\". He also wrote \"Mexican Joe\", which catapulted Jim Reeves to stardom. They began to write together and charted with many top 20 hits. Torok reached the Billboard charts several times: in 1957 with \"Pledge of Love\" (Billboard Top 20), written by his wife, Gail Redd; in 1959 with an updated version of \"Caribbean\" (No. 27 on Billboard); with \"Redneck Nat' Anthem\" by Vernon Oxford in 1976; with Jerry Wallace and their song \"This One's on the House\" (Top 20); and with Bill Phillips's \"I Can Stand It (As Long as She Can)\". In 1960, Torok's recording of \"Pink Chiffon\" topped out at No. 60 on Billboard. His last hit record was \"Instant Love\" in 1965, produced by Jimmie Bowen." ;

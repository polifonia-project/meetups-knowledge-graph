        mtp:hasAbstract        "Andrew McLuckie \"Andy\" White (27 July 1930 â€“ 9 November 2015) was a Scottish drummer, primarily a session musician. He is best known for temporarily replacing Ringo Starr on drums for the Beatles' first single, \"Love Me Do\". White was featured on the American 7\" single release of the song, which also appeared on the band's debut British album, Please Please Me. He also played on \"P.S. I Love You\", which was the B-side of \"Love Me Do\". White played with other prominent musicians and groups both in the United Kingdom and the United States, including Chuck Berry, Billy Fury, Herman's Hermits and Tom Jones. AllMusic called White \"one of the busier drummers in England from the late '50s through the mid-'70s\"." ;

He is known for hits that he released in the late 1960s and 1970s: the international hit \"Baby, I Love You\" in 1969, and \"Rock Me Gently\", which topped the U.S. singles chart in 1974. He co-wrote \"Sugar, Sugar\" in 1968 and sang on the recording as part of the Archies; it was #1 for four weeks and was \"Record of the Year\" for 1969. He has recorded under the stage name Baron Longfellow since 1978 or just as Longfellow in the early 1990s. He continues to perform under his original recording name of Andy Kim." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dua Lipa (/ˈduːə ˈliːpə/ DOO-ə LEE-pə, Albanian: [ˈdua ˈlipa]; born 22 August 1995) is an English and Albanian singer and songwriter. Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range, she is known for her signature disco-pop sound. Lipa has received numerous accolades, including six Brit Awards, three Grammy Awards, two MTV Europe Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, two Billboard Music Awards, an American Music Award, and two Guinness World Records. After working as a model, she signed with Warner Bros. Records in 2014 and released her eponymous debut album in 2017. The album peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and yielded eight singles, including \"Be the One\", \"IDGAF\", and the UK number-one single \"New Rules\", which also peaked at number six in the US. The album has been certified platinum in numerous countries worldwide and won Lipa the Brit Awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act in 2018. Her 2018 single \"One Kiss\" peaked at number one in the UK and became the year's longest-running number-one single by a female artist, winning the 2019 Brit Award for Song of the Year. In 2019, she won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, as well as the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording for her Silk City collaboration \"Electricity\". Later that year, Lipa released \"Don't Start Now\" as the lead single from her second studio album, Future Nostalgia (2020). Reaching number two in the UK and US, and number four on the US year-end chart, it was the most commercially successful song by a female artist in the US in 2020. Its follow-up singles \"Physical\", \"Break My Heart\" and \"Levitating\" also charted in the top ten, with the lattermost reaching number one on the US year-end chart in 2021. Future Nostalgia received critical acclaim and earned six Grammy nominations—including Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Song of the Year—and became her first UK number-one album. The album helped Lipa win British Female Solo Artist and British Album of the Year at the 2021 Brit Awards. She was included on the Time 100 Next list in 2021." ;

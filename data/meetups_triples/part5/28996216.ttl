Known for incorporating a mix of French house and balearic beat, Aeroplane made a name for himself as a club DJ. Aeroplane's music is disco-styled, often on the 1980s decade. Aeroplane's remixes are described by themselves as \"spacious cosmic disco\" tracks. Formerly Aeroplane was a duo, consisting of Vito de Luca and Stephen Fasano (currently known as The Magician), who left in 2010." ;

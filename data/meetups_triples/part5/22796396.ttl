        mtp:hasAbstract        "Irving Enrique Jiménez (born May 7, 1983), is a Panamanian singer better known by his stage name Makano. At the age of 12, Jiménez was part of a reggaeton group called \"Los Makanos\". The members of the group made a promise that the first of them to record a full album would carry on the group's name. Makano in Colombia means \"strong like a tree\". When he was 16, Jiménez was writing quality music, but his father discouraged him from music, saying he needed to get a real job. After several years of trying, an opportunity appeared and Jimenez appeared on the CD La Alianza in 2004. Afterward, he was given the chance to record several songs, which later became number one hits in Panama. In 2007, Jimenez signed with Panama Music and recorded his first album as a solo singer: Te Amo Rosemary, which features the songs \"Yo Quisiera Vivir\", \"Te Va a Doler\", \"Te Amo\" and \"Déjame Entrar\". In the week of May 23 and May 30, 2009, Te Amo was number 1 on Billboard Hot Latin Songs." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ronald George Arthur Chesterman (27 November 1939 â€“ 16 March 2007) was an English musician. He is best known as the original double bass player with The Strawberry Hills Boys, starring Dave Cousins on guitar, dulcimer, banjo and vocals, Tony Hooper on guitar and vocals and Ron himself on double bass. They kept that name from 1964 when they formed until June 1967, when they were giving a concert and needed to put the name of the band on stage, so they became The Strawbs. Later, after he left the band, he became a county archivist in Chester." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Belinda Peregrín Schüll (born 15 August 1989 or 1992), mononymously known as Belinda, is a Spanish-Mexican singer, songwriter and actress. She has lived in Mexico City, Mexico since a young age. In 2000, she started her career as a child actor at the age of 10 when she was cast as the lead role in the Mexican children's telenovela Amigos x siempre. She later appeared in Aventuras en el tiempo (2001) and Cómplices Al Rescate (2002). Her self-titled debut studio album Belinda (2003), was a commercial success, selling over 1,1 million copies worldwide. The album spawned many successful singles, including her debut hit single \"Lo Siento\" and \"Vivir\", the main theme of the 2004 telenovela Corazones al límite. Following her departure from Sony BMG and management in 2005, Belinda's second album Utopía (2006) earned her two Latin Grammy Awards nominations and was certified platinum in Mexico. It contained the top-ten singles \"Ni Freud ni tu mamá\", \"Bella Traición\" and \"Luz Sin Gravedad\". Belinda has also appeared in motion pictures, including the Disney Channel Original Movie The Cheetah Girls 2 (2006), and has dubbed voice roles for The Tale of Despereaux (2008) and Las aventuras de Tadeo Jones (2012). Her return to Mexican telenovelas in Camaleones (2009) and the TV series Mujeres asesinas 3 (2010), inspired her subsequent third album Carpe Diem (2010), which spawned the hit single \"Egoísta\". Her fourth album Catarsis (2013), debuted at number-one in her native Mexico, and was preceded by the hit singles \"En El Amor Hay Que Perdonar\" and \"En La Obscuridad\". In 2017, Belinda was an extra on the film Baywatch, starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Together, her four studio albums, singles and soundtracks has sold over 3 million copies making her the third best-selling female Mexican act. The international press have named her the \"Princess of Latin Pop\". As 2020, she is one of the coaches of the Mexican singing competition show, La Voz on TV Azteca after being acquired from Televisa after 7 seasons." ;

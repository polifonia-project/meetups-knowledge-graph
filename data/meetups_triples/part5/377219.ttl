        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Thomas (born 1953) is an American singer, songwriter and musician based in Great Britain. He was one of the founding members of the short-lived proto-punkers Rocket from the Tombs (1974–1975), in which he played under the moniker \"Crocus Behemoth,\" and of post-punk group Pere Ubu (1975–present, intermittently). He has also released several solo albums. Though primarily a singer, he sometimes plays melodeon, trombone, musette, guitar or other instruments. Thomas has described his artistic focus as being the \"gestalt of culture, geography and sound\". Common themes crop up throughout much of his work, such as the US Interstate Highway system, images of roadside or \"junk\" tourist culture, Brian Wilson, AM radio, and many others. Thomas has a distinctive, high pitched voice; Emerson Dameron described Thomas's singing as \"James Stewart trapped in an oboe\", and Greil Marcus writes, \"Mr Thomas's voice is that of a man muttering in a crowd. You think he's talking to himself until you realize he's talking to you.\"" ;

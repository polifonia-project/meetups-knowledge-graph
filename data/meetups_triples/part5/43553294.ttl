Born and raised in Medellín, he developed an interest in music at a young age, recording songs since age sixteen. He released his debut album, Magia, a year later in 2012. But, his breakthrough album was 2015's Pretty Boy, Dirty Boy, which led to successful collaborations with many artists. He released F.A.M.E. in 2018, another commercial success. He followed it with 11:11 in 2019, and Papi Juancho, released without further announcement in 2020. His single \"Hawái\" reached number three on the Billboard Global 200, and became the first number one single on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart. Selling more than 18 million records (albums and singles), Maluma is one of the best-selling Latin music artists. Musically, Maluma's songs have been described as reggaeton, Latin trap, and pop. Maluma has a number of singles that have charted within the top ten on Billboard Hot Latin Songs, including \"Felices los 4\", \"Borró Cassette\", and \"Corazón\". His collaborative efforts \"Chantaje\" with Shakira and \"Medellín\" with Madonna have reached the top of the Hot Latin Songs and the Dance Club Songs chart, respectively. He has worked with other international artists, such as Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, J Balvin, and The Weeknd. Maluma has won a Latin Grammy Award, an MTV Video Music Award, two Latin American Music Awards, and been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alvin Batiste (November 7, 1932 â€“ May 6, 2007) was an American avant-garde jazz clarinetist born, who was in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. He taught at his own jazz institute at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His final album was a tribute produced by Branford Marsalis, and also featured Russell Malone and Herlin Riley. Several well-known musicians studied under Batiste while at Southern University. They include Branford Marsalis, Randy Jackson, his brother Herman, Donald Harrison, Henry Butler, Charlie Singleton (Cameo), Ronald Myers and Woodie Douglas (Spirit). Mike Esneault, an Emmy Award-winning composer, pianist, and educator was also mentored by Batiste. Batiste died in Baton Rouge, of a heart attack in his sleep, aged 74." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Danny Chan Pak-Keung(Chinese: 陳百強; 7 September 1958 – 25 October 1993) was a Hong Kong singer, songwriter, records producer and actor. He is widely recognised as the first modern day pop idol in Hong Kong, gaining fame alongside performers Alan Tam, Anita Mui, and Leslie Cheung, who were collectively known as \"Three Kings and a Queen\" (三王一后) or \"Tam Cheung Mui Chan\" (譚張梅陳) in the 1980s. He actively engaged in various charity shows and activities. His innate fashion sense was renowned in Hong Kong show business. Chan is best remembered for his Cantopop romance ballads and soul touching music compositions. His most renowned works include \"Waiting\" (等), \"Life Expectations\" (一生何求), \"Ripples\" (漣漪), \"Loving You Alone\" (偏偏喜歡你) and \"Cherish Tonight\" (今宵多珍重). Chan died on October 25, 1993, after being in a coma for 17 months." ;

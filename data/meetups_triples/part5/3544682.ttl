        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brad Ira Fiedel (born March 10, 1951) is an American composer of scores for film and television. He is well known for his collaborations with director James Cameron on The Terminator (1984) and its blockbuster sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), as well as the action-comedy True Lies (1994). On these scores he mostly used synthesizers, but composed a number of scores utilizing various acoustic instruments, including full orchestra. Fiedel's work includes other films in the genres of science fiction, action and horror, such as Fright Night (1985) and sequel Fright Night Part 2 (1988), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) and Johnny Mnemonic (1995). He also scored a number of comedy films, such as Compromising Positions (1985) and Fraternity Vacation (1985), as well as drama films including The Accused (1988), Blue Steel (1990) and Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny (1996). He retired from scoring films in the late 1990s and now focuses primarily on creating original musicals." ;

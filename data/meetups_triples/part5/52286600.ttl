        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elzadie Robinson (possibly April 24, 1897 â€“ January 17, 1975) was an American classic female blues singer and songwriter. She recorded 34 songs between 1926 and 1929. Unusually for the time, she composed or co-composed most of her work. Details of her life outside the recording studio are sketchy. AllMusic noted that \"Robinson was a second-level blues singer whose voice seemed to get stronger with time\"." ;

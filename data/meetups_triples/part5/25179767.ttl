        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tamar Mardirossian (Armenian: Թամար Մարտիրոսեան; born October 28, 1986), known professionally as Tamar Kaprelian, is an Armenian-American singer, songwriter, and philanthropist. Kaprelian began her career in 2008, after winning a cover contest organized by OneRepublic, performing \"Apologize\". Following her win, Ryan Tedder introduced her to Interscope Records executives, and she was signed to the label. She went on to release her debut studio album Sinner or a Saint in 2010 through Interscope. In 2015, Kaprelian was recruited by Public Television of Armenia (ARMTV) to represent Armenia in Eurovision Song Contest 2015 as part of the group Genealogy with the song \"Face the Shadow\", placing sixteenth. She later attempted to represent Armenia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 as a solo artist, competing in the Armenian national selection Depi Evratesil 2018 with the song \"Poison (Ari Ari)\", but was eliminated in the semi-final. Outside of music, Kaprelian has also founded the Nvak Foundation, an organization dedicated to the development of young Armenian singers, songwriters, and musicians." ;

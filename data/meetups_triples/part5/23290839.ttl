        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexander Scott (1920–1989) was a Scottish poet, playwright and scholar born in Aberdeen. He wrote poetry in both Scots and Scottish English as well as plays, literary reviews and critical studies of literature. As a writer, scholar, dramatist, broadcaster, critic and editor, he showed a life-long commitment to Scottish literary culture. He was latterly a tutor and reader of Scottish literature at the University of Glasgow, where he was instrumental in establishing Scotland's first Department of Scottish Literature in the academic year 1971–72. In 1972, Scott was one of the founders of the Lallans Society (later the Scots Language Society). He was a member of its committee from the outset and served as Preses from 1974 to 1977 and from 1979 to 1983. He also served as President of the Association for Scottish Literary Studies from 1976 to 1979. In 1985 he succeeded Robert McLellan as Honorary Preses. In 1983, Scott became a founding editor of the periodical New Writing Scotland." ;

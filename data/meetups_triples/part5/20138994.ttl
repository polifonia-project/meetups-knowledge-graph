He is the lead vocalist, guitar player and songwriter for the band MGMT, praised for (according to Interview Magazine) \"an uncanny knack for producing pop music that sounds as if it were filtered through a kaleidoscope.\" One of his (and MGMT cofounder Benjamin Goldwasser's) songs, \"Kids\" (from the Oracular Spectacular album), received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, while the duo was nominated in the Best New Artist category." ;

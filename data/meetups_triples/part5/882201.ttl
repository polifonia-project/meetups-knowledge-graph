His most recent project is with Remedy Entertainment as an animator, sound designer and graphic artist. Prior to working with Remedy, Hajba has been credited on games developed by 3D Realms, PopCap Games, Introversion Software Limited, Epic Games, and Housemarque. Hajba was a member of the widely popular but now defunct demoscene group Future Crew, which produced some highly acclaimed demos during the 1990s.

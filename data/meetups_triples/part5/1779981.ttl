        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hakeem Temidayo Seriki (born November 28, 1979), better known by his stage name Chamillionaire (/kəˈmɪliənɛər/), is an American rapper. He was the founder and an original member of The Color Changin' Click from 2001 until the group split in 2005. He began his solo career with local releases in 2002, including the collaborative album Get Ya Mind Correct with fellow Houston rapper and childhood friend Paul Wall. He signed to Universal Records in 2005 and released The Sound of Revenge under Universal. It included hit singles \"Turn It Up\" featuring Lil' Flip and the number-one, Grammy-winning hit \"Ridin'\" featuring Krayzie Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Ultimate Victory followed in 2007, which was notable for not containing any profanity. Chamillionaire is also known for his most anticipated Mixtape Messiah series, which ran from 2004 until 2009. In 2011, Chamillionaire left Universal Records, which led to his would-be third album, Venom, going unreleased. He released his first independent extended play Ammunition in March 2012 and was noted as his first major release since he left the label. Another EP, Elevate, was released in February 2013. He states that it is going to be one of several to be released before his third studio album, and shortly after his third EP Reignfall was released in July 2013. He is working on his third studio album, Poison. Chamillionaire is the CEO of Chamillitary Entertainment, which he founded in 2004. He joined Los Angeles-based venture capital firm Upfront Ventures in 2015 and has been focusing on his entrepreneurial career over his musical career since." ;

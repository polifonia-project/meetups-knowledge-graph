        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Cabot Sherman Jr. (born July 22, 1943), known professionally as Bobby Sherman, is an American retired paramedic, police officer, singer, actor and occasional songwriter who became a teen idol in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He had a series of successful singles, notably the million-seller \"Little Woman\" (1969). Sherman retreated from his show business career in the 1970s for a career as an EMT and a deputy sheriff, though he occasionally performed into the 1990s." ;

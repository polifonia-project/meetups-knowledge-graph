He was also a poet and songwriter and was widely admired for his excellent command of Sinhala. Abeysekera wrote the lyrics to over 2,000 songs, a record for a lyricist in Sri Lanka. His compositions are still covered by some of the island's top musicians to this day, introducing his lyrics to new audiences in South Asia, and his songs are played regularly by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation." ;

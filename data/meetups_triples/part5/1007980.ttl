        mtp:hasAbstract        "Notker the Stammerer (c. 840 – 6 April 912), Notker Balbulus, or simply Notker, was a Benedictine monk at the Abbey of Saint Gall active as a poet, scholar and (probably) composer. Described as \"a significant figure in the Western Church\", Notker made substantial contributions to both the music and literature of his time. He is usually credited with two major works of the Carolingian period: the Liber Hymnorum, which includes an important collection of early sequences, and the earliest biography of Charlemagne, Gesta Caroli Magni. His other works include a biography of Saint Gall, the Vita Sancti Galli, and a martyrology. Notker was born near the Abbey of Saint Gall where he was educated alongside the monks Tuotilo and Ratpert; all three were composers, making the Abbey an important center of early medieval music. He quickly became a central figure of the Abbey and among the leading literary scholars of the Early Middle Ages. A renowned teacher, he taught Solomon III, the bishop of Constance and on occasion advised Charles the Fat. Although venerated by the Abbey of Saint Gall and the namesake of later scholars there such as Notker Physicus and Notker Labeo, Notker was never formally canonized. He was given \"the Stammerer\" as an epitaph, due to his lifelong stutter." ;

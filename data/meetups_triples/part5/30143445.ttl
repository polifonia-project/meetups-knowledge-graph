        mtp:hasAbstract        "Borghild Holmsen (22 October 1865 – 4 December 1938) was a Norwegian pianist, music critic and composer. Borghild Holmsen was born in Kråkstad (now Ski), Akershus, Norway. When she was 7 years old, her family settled in Christiania (now Oslo). She studied piano with Agathe Backer-Grøndahl and Otto Winter-Hjelm, and continued her studies with Carl Reinecke and Salomon Jadassohn in Leipzig and Albert Becker in Berlin. She made her debut in 1890 in Christiania, afterward touring as a concert pianist in Europe and the United States. After ending her concert career, she became a teacher at the Bergen Music Conservatory, where Harald Sæverud was one of her pupils. She wrote as a music critic for the newspapers, Bergens Aftenblad and Bergens Arbeiderblad." ;

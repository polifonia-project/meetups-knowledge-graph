        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gavin Muir (15 September 1951 â€“ 15 July 2002), was a British actor and musician probably best known for his role in the 1983 Television version of Accidental Death of an Anarchist. Muir trained as a child actor at the Arts Educational School during which he made Radio appearances including work on the Archers. He was very politically active during the 1970s working for a variety of Theatre in Education companies including national touring work with Brian Way, and several years with the Wearabout Theatre Company in Sunderland. As an active member of the Workers Revolutionary Party, he was drawn to the political theatre company Belt and Braces run by Gavin Richards, and appeared in their West End run of Accidental Death of an Anarchist by Dario Fo. He met and married his wife, Teresa, a Northern Irish woman, in 1974. They remained together until his death in 2002." ;

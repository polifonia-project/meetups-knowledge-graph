        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marcel Moyse (pron. moh-EEZ; May 17, 1889, in St. Amour, France – November 1, 1984, in Brattleboro, Vermont, United States) was a French flautist. Moyse studied at the Paris Conservatory and was a student of Philippe Gaubert, Adolphe Hennebains, and Paul Taffanel; all of whom were flute virtuosos in their time. Moyse played principal flute in various Paris orchestras and appeared widely as a soloist and made many recordings. His trademark tone was clear, flexible, penetrating, and controlled by a fast vibrato. This was a characteristic of the 'French style' of flute playing that was to influence the modern standard for flutists worldwide. Moyse taught on the faculty of the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal, and was a founder of the Marlboro Music School and festival in Vermont. Moyse strove to teach his students \"not how to play the flute, but to make music\". Among his students were James Galway, Paula Robison, Trevor Wye, William Bennett, Carol Wincenc, , Robert Aitken, Arthur Kitti, Karen Reynolds, September Payne and . Moyse authored many flute studies, including De la Sonorite and Tone Development Through Interpretation, published by ." ;

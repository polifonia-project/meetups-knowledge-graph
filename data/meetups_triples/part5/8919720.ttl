In 2008, he released his debut album Departure, which he wrote, arranged and produced. The album achieved certified gold status in the United Kingdom and earned him a Music of Black Origin Awards (MOBO) nomination. On 12 October 2009, Cruz released his follow-up album Rokstarr, which includes the number one singles \"Break Your Heart\" and \"Dynamite\". Cruz collaborated with Kesha on the single \"Dirty Picture\", and with Kylie Minogue and Travie McCoy on his single \"Higher\".

Cruz's third studio album, TY.O, was first released in Germany on 12 December 2011. In 2012, Cruz co-wrote David Guetta and Usher's song \"Without You\" and the same year released the music video to There She Goes featuring Uzbek supermodel Nadya Nepomnyashaya.

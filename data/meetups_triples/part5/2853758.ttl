Schermick and drummer Tony Destra were fired from Cinderella in 1985 at the request of the record label, Polygram. Following his departure from Cinderella, he joined up with Tony Destra, Dean Davidson, Billy Childs and Johnny Dee to form Britny Fox and became their lead guitarist. Schermick played on every album released by Britny Fox until their breakup in 1992. Prior to Cinderella and Britny Fox, Michael had been a guitarist in the bands Atlantic Star, Telepath, Psychopath, Diamonds, Saints in Hell and The Priscella Harriet Band.

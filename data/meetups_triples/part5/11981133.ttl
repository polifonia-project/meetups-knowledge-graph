Born in Mannheim and raised in B체rstadt, Capristo was first exposed to singing and dancing competitions in 2001, when she won Kiddy Contest, a reality television singing competition for teens in Austria, with her song Ich w체nsche mir einen Bankomat. In the mid to late 2000s, Capristo rose to fame as a founding member of the girl band Monrose, the result of the fifth season of the German television talent show Popstars.

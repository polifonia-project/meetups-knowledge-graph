        mtp:hasAbstract        "Connie K. Lim, professionally known as Milck (stylized as MILCK), is a Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter. A child of immigrants from Hong Kong, she initially performed as an independent artist for several years, and rose to widespread attention after a video of a performance of her song \"Quiet\" at the 2017 Women's March became popular, and became embraced as a feminist anthem for the movement. She was eventually signed to Atlantic Records, and released her debut EP This Is Not The End in 2018. Milck's second EP, Into Gold, was released in early 2020, preceded by the lead single \"If I Ruled the World\". She released another protest song later that year, \"Somebody's Beloved\", in collaboration with British songwriter Bipolar Sunshine." ;

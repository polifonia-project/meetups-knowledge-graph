        mtp:hasAbstract        "Geoffrey Cannon (born 1940) is an English author, journalist and former magazine editor, and scholar. From 1968 to 1972, he was the music critic for The Guardian, a role that made him the first dedicated rock critic at a British daily newspaper. Having worked as the arts editor for New Society magazine, he became editor of the BBC publication Radio Times from 1969 to 1979. During that time, he also wrote on music and pop culture for The Listener, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, Creem, Rock et Folk, Melody Maker and Time Out. Since the early 1980s Cannon has worked in public health, mostly food and nutrition policy. He co-authored, with Hetty Einzig, the bestseller Dieting Makes You Fat in 1983, and with Caroline Walker the 1984 bestseller The Food Scandal: What's Wrong with the British Diet and How to Put It Right. Cannon's other books include The Politics of Food. He is a former director of science for the World Cancer Research Fund and now lives in Brazil where he is a member of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies in Nutrition and Health (NUPENS), University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Clarita \"Claire\" Crisostomo dela Fuente-de Guzman (Tagalog pronunciation: [dɛla ˈfwentɛ dɛ ɡʊsˈman]; December 28, 1958 – March 30, 2021) was a Filipina singer. She achieved celebrity status in the late 1970s with the jukebox hit \"Sayang\" and was given the title \"Asia's Sweetest Voice\" because of her singing style. She was dubbed \"the Karen Carpenter of the Philippines\" because of her contralto's resemblance to that of Carpenter's. Her first album in 1978 was then the Philippines' biggest seller at the time of release. She went on to record seven more albums. Besides \"Sayang\", she was also known for hits like \"Minsan-Minsan\" and \"Nakaw na Pag-ibig\". She was given the title \"Queen of Tagalog Songs\" alongside Rico J. Puno as her counterpart. She was also named \"Jukebox Queen\" together with her contemporaries Imelda Papin, Eva Eugenio and Didith Reyes, and was also dubbed as \"Asia's Sweetest Voice\". She was a contralto. She was also a successful businesswoman. She was the president of the Integrated Metropolitan Bus Operators Association (IMBOA), though her bus franchise was cancelled in 2011 for joining a nationwide transport strike. In 1977, she teamed up with Eddie Rodriguez who wrote the song \"Halik Sa Paa, Halik Sa Kamay\" for an upcoming film starring Eddie Rodriguez and Vilma Santos." ;

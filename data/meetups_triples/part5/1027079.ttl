        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tamio Okuda (奥田 民生, Okuda Tamio, born 12 May 1965 in Hiroshima) is a Japanese singer, songwriter, and producer. He started his career in 1986 as a member of the band Unicorn. After Unicorn broke up, Okuda moved on to a solo career in 1994 with the single \"Ai no Tame ni\". He has written and composed many songs for various artists, particularly Puffy. He is signed to Sony Music Japan. He was ranked number 25 in a list of Japan's top 100 musicians, provided by HMV Japan in 2003. His band Unicorn was also ranked at number 61. Unicorn reunited in 2009. He appeared in the 2011 Batsu game on Gaki no Tsukai. He performed his song \"Ai no Tame ni\" with alternate lyrics to recap all that went on in the New Years' special. On July 11, 2018, Okuda, Kazuyoshi Saito, Yohito Teraoka (Jun Sky Walkers), Takashi Hamazaki (Flying Kids), Yo-King (Magokoro Brothers) and Tortoise Matsumoto announced the formation of a supergroup called the Curling Sitones (カーリングシトーンズ, Kāringu Shitōnzu). Each member is a multi-instrumentalist with all of them at-least being able to provide vocals and guitar and, like the Traveling Wilburys, each uses a pseudonym featuring \"Sitone\". They formed for a concert on September 23, 2018 at Zepp Tokyo celebrating Teraoka's 25th anniversary as a musician." ;

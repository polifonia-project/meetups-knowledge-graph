She is the daughter of the Lebanese Maronite exiled politician Etienne Sakr, a former member of the Lebanese Forces and leader of the far-right Guardians of the Cedars. Carole Sakr gained fame as the lead singer for the Lebanese music band \"ZED\". ZED was a music duo project consisting of Carole and music composer Hadi Sharara. Together they released an album entitled Away in the early 1990s, which included singles like \"My One 4 Everything\", part of the song being also used as a promotional jingle for Radio One Lebanon, \"Shout\" and the title track \"Away\" for which a vid was shot and aired on local TV stations. The duo also took part in international musical festivals. Their last recording as ZED was a non album single exclusively played on Radio One Lebanon. After the split-up of the band, Karol continued to enjoy a solo music career.

He is mainly known for his 2003 hit single \"Fuck It (I Don't Want You Back)\". Some of the songs written by Eamon are in a style called ho-wop, which \"blends the smoothness of R&B with the grittiness of hip hop\". Eamon's songs are typically soft ballads mixed with aggressive lyrics with the theme of infidelity." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ray Arthur Rayburn (August 21, 1948 – January 31, 2021) was an American audio engineer, author and standards analyst who co-developed nine audio standards with the Audio Engineering Society (AES), including CobraNet for digital audio. Rayburn was a top expert in sound system installations in churches, but he was also well known for radio and television studio engineering, upgrading Saturday Night Live to stereophonic sound in 1984. During 1992–94, Rayburn redesigned the sound system in the United States Senate chamber, implementing the world's first fully digital audio system based on digital signal processing. Rayburn contributed chapters for Glen Ballou's audio engineering textbook, and for John M. Eargle's The Microphone Book (2001). In 2009, the AES honored Rayburn with the Fellowship Award. He was an emeritus member of the Acoustical Society of America." ;

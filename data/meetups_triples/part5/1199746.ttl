He is best known as the longtime bassist for heavy metal band Pantera, from 1982 to their disbandment in 2003, and as of their reunion in 2022, he is the band's only constant member. Brown is also a former member of the supergroup Down (2001–2011) and the former bassist for Kill Devil Hill. He released his debut solo album Smoke on This… in 2017. For the first time in Brown's career, the work features him not only as a bassist but also as lead vocalist and guitarist. Brown authored a book called Official Truth 101 Proof, which was released in April 2013. The book documents Pantera's formation, career, and disbandment." ;

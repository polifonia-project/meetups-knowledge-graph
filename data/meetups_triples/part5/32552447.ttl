        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nguyễn Khoa Tóc Tiên (Vietnamese: [tɐwk͡p̚˧ˀ˦ tiɜŋ˧]; born 13 May 1989), known simply as Tóc Tiên, is a Vietnamese singer, model and actress. Beginning her career as a child, Tiên later became a teen idol, participating in several singing competitions and releasing two studio albums: Nụ cười nắng mai (2007) and Tóc Tiên thiếu nữ (2008). Her third solo album, My Turn (2009), projects a new, sexually-charged image which she adopted while living in the United States and performing frequently on Thúy Nga Productions' variety show, Paris by Night. Tiên appeared in the first season of the television series, The Remix, in 2015. The show gave her an opportunity to perform \"Ngày mai (Vũ điệu cồng chiêng)\", the song which brought her success and later became one of her signature hits. Subsequent singles, notably \"Em không là duy nhất\" and \"#Catena (Có ai thương em như anh)\", were moderately successful. Tiên made her film debut in Già gân, mỹ nhân và găng tơ (2015), and has signed numerous endorsement deals. On television, she hosted Bài hát Việt in 2008 and was a judge on The Voice of Vietnam and Vietnam Idol Kids. Her accolades include three Làn Sóng Xanh Awards, two Yan Vpop 20 Awards, an Mnet Asian Music Award, a Zing Music Award, an LGBT Appreciation Award and a Vietnamese Elle Style Award." ;

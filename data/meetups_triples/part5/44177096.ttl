He is credited as a co-writer on multiple OMD releases, including the 1991 UK No. 3 hit, \"Sailing on the Seven Seas\". In 1998, Kershaw co-founded girl group Atomic Kitten, alongside OMD frontman Andy McCluskey. Together they co-wrote much of the group's material, including the 2001 UK chart-topper, \"Whole Again\". Kershaw is a long time Liverpool Football Club fan. He and his wife have two children." ;

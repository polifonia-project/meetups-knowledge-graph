        mtp:hasAbstract        "Salman Ahmad (Urdu: سلمان احمد, born 12 December 1963) is a Pakistani born-American musician, rock guitarist, physician, activist, and professor at the City University of New York. He earned nationwide popularity in 1998 for his unique style of neoclassical playing in rock. An early engineer of the Vital Signs, he formed Junoon (lit. Obsession) in 1990 with American bassist Brian O'Connell and pioneered the Sufi influenced rock music in Pakistan. He started his activism in the mid-1990s and has been involved in two BBC documentaries concerning the issues in Pakistan such as society, education, religion and science. He has served as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/AIDS Programme towards spreading awareness about HIV in South Asia. While working with the Pakistan's media to help initiate peace between India and Pakistan, Ahmad continues to produce documentaries and solo guitar albums. At present, he is serving tenured professor at the Queens College of the City University of New York. With Junoon band being disintegrated, Salman Ahmad continues to perform as a solo artist under the \"Junoon\" label and has moved to New York and released one album as a solo artist, \"Infiniti\" in 2005. Salman was tested positive for COVID-19 in April 2020." ;

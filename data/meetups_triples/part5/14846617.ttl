        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeffrey Scott Wood (born May 10, 1968) is an American country music artist. Wood was signed to a publishing contract in 1994, writing songs for other country artists, including \"Cowboy Love\", a Top 5 hit for John Michael Montgomery in 1996. He signed to a recording contract with Liberty Records later that year, but did not release anything while on the label. His debut album, Between the Earth and the Stars, was released in 1997 on Imprint Records. This album produced three chart singles for Wood on the Hot Country Songs charts that year, including the No. 44-peaking \"You Just Get One\". Although he did not chart again after 1997, Wood continued to write songs for other artists into the 2000s, including Neal McCoy and Phil Vassar, and independently released a second album in 2008." ;

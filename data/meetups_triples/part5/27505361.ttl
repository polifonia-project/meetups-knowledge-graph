        mtp:hasAbstract        "Daniel Lopatin (born July 25, 1982), best known as Oneohtrix Point Never or OPN, is an American experimental electronic music producer, composer, singer and songwriter. His music has incorporated experimentation with tropes from various music genres and eras, atmospheric sound design, sample-based song structures and elaborate MIDI production. He began releasing synth-based recordings in the mid-2000s and received initial acclaim for the 2009 compilation Rifts, as well as the influential vaporwave release Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 (2010). He subsequently signed to Warp in 2013, and has released studio albums on the label since. He has also composed scores for films such as Good Time (2017) and Uncut Gems (2019); the former won him the Soundtrack Award at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival." ;

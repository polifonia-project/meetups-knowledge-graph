        mtp:hasAbstract        "Geoff Palmer (Geoffrey Palmer born January 17, 1980, in Wakefield, Massachusetts, United States), also known by the stage name Geoff Useless, is an American musician from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, now living in Madison, Wisconsin. He played bass and provided backing vocals for The Queers straight out of high school, and played guitar and did lead vocals for The Guts and The Nobodys. In early 2011, he did a folk punk solo project with other musicians around Portsmouth called The Geoff Useless (Band). Currently, he co-writes songs for, and plays lead guitar in, a traditional rock and roll /powerpop band called The Connection. The Connection's debut album New England's Newest Hit Makers was released in the Summer of 2011. It, and subsequent releases, captured the attention of Steve Van Zandt, E Street Band member and creator of the popular Sirius XM Radio Station, Little Steven's Underground Garage. Over about a one-year period, Van Zandt went on to name four Connection songs \"Coolest Song in the World,\" putting each in heavy rotation to give the band continual nationwide exposure. Geoff signed with Stardumb Records, on August 13, 2018. In 2022 Geoff Palmer added a twist to the Ramones tribute series by covering the infamous 1989 Dee Dee King rap album Standing in the Spotlight. Released on Dee Dee's birthday from Stardumb Records. Dee Dee's wife, Vera Ramone, who the song Baby Doll is written for, provided a quote for the LP's hype sticker: \"This tribute album to the late and great DEE DEE RAMONE/KING by GEOFF PALMER is just as fun and entertaining as the original from 1989. Geoff and his bandmates have done a fantastic rendition of \"Standing in the Spotlight\" with a fresh and updated spin. I'm sure Dee Dee would feel honored and proud by this kind gesture, just as I am. Many thanks from both of us! - Vera Ramone King (a/k/a Baby Doll).\"" ;

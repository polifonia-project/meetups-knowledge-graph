        mtp:hasAbstract        "Talmage Holt Farlow (June 7, 1921 â€“ July 25, 1998) was an American jazz guitarist. He was nicknamed \"Octopus\" because of how his large, quick hands spread over the fretboard. As Steve Rochinski notes, \"Of all the guitarists to emerge in the first generation after Charlie Christian, Tal Farlow, more than any other, has been able to move beyond the rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic vocabulary associated with the early electric guitar master. Tal's incredible speed, long, weaving lines, rhythmic excitement, highly developed harmonic sense, and enormous reach (both physical and musical) have enabled him to create a style that clearly stands apart from the rest.\" Where guitarists of his day combined rhythmic chords with linear melodies, Farlow placed single notes together in clusters, varying between harmonically enriched tones. As music critic Stuart Nicholson put it, \"In terms of guitar prowess, it was the equivalent of Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute mile.\"" ;

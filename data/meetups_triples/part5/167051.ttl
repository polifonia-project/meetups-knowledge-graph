        mtp:hasAbstract        "Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero (born December 12, 1937),known professionally as Connie Francis, is an American pop singer, actress, and top-charting female vocalist of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Called the “First Lady of Rock & Roll” in one headline of a marginal publication, she is estimated to have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. In 1960, Francis was recognized as the most successful female artist in Germany, Japan, England, Italy, Australia and in every other country where records were purchased. She was the first woman in history to reach No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100, just one of her other 53 career hits." ;

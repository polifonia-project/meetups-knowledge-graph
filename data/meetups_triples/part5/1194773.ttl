        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julee Ann Cruise (December 1, 1956 â€“ June 9, 2022) was an American singer, songwriter and actress, best known for her collaborations with composer Angelo Badalamenti and film director David Lynch in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She released four albums beginning with 1989's Floating into the Night. Cruise is best known for her 1989 single \"Falling\"; an instrumental version was used as the theme song for the television series Twin Peaks in which she appeared in a recurring role as a roadhouse singer. She reprised the role in the 1992 movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (which also featured her music), and in the 2017 revival series Twin Peaks: The Return. She was also featured in Lynch and Badalamenti's avant-garde 1990 theater production Industrial Symphony No. 1, which was filmed and released on home media. Other notable singles included \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\" (1990) and \"If I Survive\" (1999) by the band Hybrid, which featured her vocals. In the 1990s, she was a touring member of The B-52s, filling in for Cindy Wilson. Cruise was also a stage actress and appeared in the off-Broadway musicals Return to the Forbidden Planet and Radiant Baby in 2004. Her final album, My Secret Life, was released in 2011." ;

She rose to prominence in 2004 as a contestant on the third season of American Idol, placing twelfth in the season finals. In 2007, LaBelle began recording covers of R&B and soul music for her YouTube channel. These videos led to work as a backing vocalist starting in 2008 and a record deal in 2011 with Epic in partnership with I Am Other and So So Def Recordings. LaBelle released a sampler, three singles, and a posthumous extended play (EP). Born in Toronto, Ontario, and raised in Seattle, Washington, LaBelle began pursuing music as a career in her teens.

Keri Hilson hired LaBelle as a backing vocalist after hearing her rendition of \"Energy\", which led to her working for other artists on their tours. LaBelle signed a record deal after Pharrell Williams and Jermaine Dupri contacted her. Her sampler Pharrell Williams and Jermaine Dupri Present Leah LaBelle (2012) was distributed only to record companies. It was supported by two singles, \"Sexify\" and \"What Do We Got To Lose?\".

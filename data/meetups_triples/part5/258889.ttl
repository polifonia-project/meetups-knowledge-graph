        mtp:hasAbstract        "Herbert Jay Solomon (April 16, 1930 â€“ July 1, 2003), known by his stage name Herbie Mann, was an American jazz flute player and important early practitioner of world music. Early in his career, he also played tenor saxophone and clarinet (including bass clarinet), but Mann was among the first jazz musicians to specialize on the flute. His most popular single was \"Hi-Jack\", which was a Billboard No. 1 dance hit for three weeks in 1975. Mann emphasized the groove approach in his music. Mann felt that from his repertoire, the \"epitome of a groove record\" was Memphis Underground or Push Push, because the \"rhythm section locked all in one perception.\"" ;

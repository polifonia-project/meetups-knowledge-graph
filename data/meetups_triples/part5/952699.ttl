        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eduard Van De Walle (12 July 1932 – 6 February 2016), known by his stage name Eddy Wally, was a Belgian schlager singer from Zelzate, East Flanders, and the once self-proclaimed \"Voice of Europe\". As a crooner and showman, Eddy Wally toured worldwide, from China, to Australia, all of Europe and the United States, and even 24 tour dates in 1979 within the USSR. As Eddy Wally was short, he tended to use outside chairs in his act. Eddy Wally was best known for his song \"Chérie\" which became a double-platinum hit. Wally was also known for \"Ik spring uit een vliegmachien\" (\"I'll jump out of an aeroplane\"), and \"Dans Mi Amor\"." ;

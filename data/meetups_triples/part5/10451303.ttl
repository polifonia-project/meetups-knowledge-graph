        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kerryn William Tolhurst (born 1948) is an Australian country rock musician, songwriter and producer. He was based in the United States from late 1970s to the late 1990s, although he periodically returned to Australia. He was a founder of the Australian group, the Dingoes (1973–1979, 2009–present) and co-wrote their top 40 hit single, \"Way Out West\" (October 1973). It was covered by fellow Australians, James Blundell and James Reyne in 1991, which reached No. 2 on the ARIA Singles Chart. He also formed a short-lived group, Rattling Sabres, and wrote their single, \"All Fired Up\" (1987). The track was reworked by Pat Benatar (and Myron Grombacher) and released as her single in June 1988, which peaked at No. 2 in Australia and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand." ;

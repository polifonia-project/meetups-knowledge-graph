        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Ryan Pritchard (born May 4, 1972), better known by his stage name Mike Dirnt, is an American rock musician who is the co-founder, bassist, backing and occasional lead vocalist, and former guitarist of Green Day. He has also played in several other bands, including the Frustrators. His stage name Dirnt was originally a nickname that his friends from grade school gave him, as he constantly played \"air bass/guitar\" and made a \"dirnt, dirnt, dirnt\" noise while pretending to pluck the strings." ;

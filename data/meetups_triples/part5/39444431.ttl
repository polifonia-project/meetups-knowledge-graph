        mtp:hasAbstract        "Soichi Terada (寺田 創一, Terada Sōichi, born March 19, 1965, in Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese electronic music composer, best known for his work in the Ape Escape video game series. He started producing music in 1989 as well as remixing singers such as Nami Shimada. He and fellow producer Shinichiro Yokota formed Far East Recording in 1990, releasing various albums and singles. In 1999, after releasing Sumo Jungle, he was given an opportunity to compose for Ape Escape. In 2014, \"The Far East Transcripts\" EP was released, sparking interest in Terada's work. A year after, the album Sounds from the Far East was released, which led to him touring and creating more music." ;

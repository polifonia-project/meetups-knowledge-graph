        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jaye Muller (born Jens Müller) is an East German musician and Internet entrepreneur who performed under the name J., and later in a duo named \"Muller and Patton\" with American musician Ben Patton and under the name \"Count Jaye\" (since 2015). In 1992, he released his second solo album, We Are the Majority. As of 1996, it had sold 350,000 copies worldwide. The NME once called him \"A ludicrously talented maestro\". Dave Marsh wrote in PLAYBOY \"If there’s a cure for Morrissey, this is it\". Muller later co-founded, together with ex-Beach Boys Manager Jack Rieley, the internet company JFAX, later renamed to j2 Global (Nasdaq: JCOM), which initially allowed its users to receive fax and voicemail through their email, one of the first unified messaging systems. Müller is no longer active in the company since 2004, but remained shareholder until 2016." ;

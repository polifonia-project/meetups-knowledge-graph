        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cameron Jibril Thomaz (born September 8, 1987), better known by his stage name Wiz Khalifa, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. He released his debut album, Show and Prove, in 2006 and signed to Warner Bros. Records in 2007. His Eurodance-influenced single \"Say Yeah\" received urban radio airplay, charting on the Rhythmic Top 40 and Hot Rap Tracks charts in 2008, becoming his first minor hit. Thomaz parted with Warner Bros. and released his second album, Deal or No Deal, in November 2009. He released the mixtape Kush and Orange Juice as a free download in April 2010; he then signed with Atlantic Records. Thomaz then adopted a more radio-friendly, pop-oriented approach with his debut single for Atlantic, \"Black and Yellow\". The song, a tribute to his hometown of Pittsburgh, debuted at number 100 and eventually peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song became the lead single for his third album Rolling Papers, which was released in March 2011, and also had the Top 40 singles \"Roll Up\" and \"No Sleep\". The album's success was followed up with O.N.I.F.C. in December 2012, which was backed by the singles \"Work Hard, Play Hard\" and \"Remember You\" (featuring the Weeknd). Wiz released his fifth album Blacc Hollywood in August 2014, backed by the lead single \"We Dem Boyz\". In March 2015, he released \"See You Again\" (featuring Charlie Puth) for the soundtrack of the film Furious 7 and the song peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julian Charles John Lennon (born John Charles Julian Lennon; 8 April 1963) is an English musician. He is the son of Beatles member John Lennon and his first wife, Cynthia, and he is named after his paternal grandmother, Julia Lennon. Julian inspired three Beatles songs: \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" (1967), \"Hey Jude\" (1968) and \"Good Night\" (1968). His parents divorced in 1968 after his father had an affair with Yoko Ono. Lennon started a music career in 1984 with the album Valotte, best known for its lead single \"Too Late for Goodbyes\", and has since released six more albums. He has held exhibitions of his fine-art photography and has had several children's books published. In 2006, Lennon produced the environmental documentary film WhaleDreamers, which won eight international awards. In 2007, he founded The White Feather foundation, whose stated mission goal is to address \"environmental and humanitarian issues\". In 2018, Lennon was executive producer of the documentary film Women of the White Buffalo, which chronicles the lives of women living on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. In 2020, Lennon was executive producer of the Netflix documentary Kiss the Ground about regenerative agriculture." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "William \"Shooby\" Taylor (September 19, 1929 â€“ June 4, 2003) was an American jazz vocalist famous for scat singing over various records, including those of the Ink Spots, the Harmonicats, Johnny Cash, Miles Davis, Mozart, and Cristy Lane, in a baritone voice. Nicknamed \"The Human Horn\", he is noted for his highly idiosyncratic scat style, using sounds and syllables quite unlike those used by other scat singers. Writing in The New York Times, Marc Ferris noted that \"those who seek out music that swims against the mainstream have been entranced by [Taylor's] originality.\" Music historian Irwin Chusid described Taylor as \"the world's weirdest scat singer,\" \"100 percent uninhibited and soulful, in a lovably demented way,\" and stated that \"a joyousness permeates [his] performances, a celebratory quality that serves as an analgesic for temporary relief from existential pain.\"" ;

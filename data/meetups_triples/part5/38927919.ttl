Whilst studying at University in London, as a budding dance music producer he used his location and the student nights run by the University to get sets at Electroworks in Angel and then clubs such as Fabric and Ministry of Sound. From a background in creating music, he quickly started to put together sets of originals, remixes, and bootlegs of his own design, incorporating classic anthems with his super heavy bass creations to come up with sets of his own design.

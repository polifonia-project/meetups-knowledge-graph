        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeffrey Neal \"Jeff\" Pezzati (born February 6, 1960) is the lead singer of the Chicago punk band Naked Raygun. From 1983 to 1985, he also played bass for the band Big Black. In 1980 Pezzati was asked to audition for Naked Raygun (then known as Negro Commando). Pezzati passed the audition and became the band's longest-running member. The band has been credited by Dave Grohl of Nirvana/Foo Fighters fame for inspiring the then 13 year old Grohl to get into punk music. In 1999 Pezzati founded the band The Bomb." ;

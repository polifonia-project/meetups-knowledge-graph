        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joey Vera (born April 24, 1963) is an American bassist who is known as a member of the heavy metal band Armored Saint and progressive metal band Fates Warning. During 2004 and early 2005, he toured with Anthrax as a fill-in for Frank Bello, who had taken a break from the band. He was also a member of Engine, recorded with Tribe After Tribe, and appears on the OSI album Free. His first solo album, A Thousand Faces, was released in 1994. His current solo project, A Chinese Firedrill, released an album titled Circles in 2007. On August 1, 2019, Vera was announced as the touring bassist for a newly reunited Mercyful Fate filling in for Timi Hansen. Originally a guitar player, Vera took interest in playing the instrument after listening to Kiss' Alive!, and by the time Armored Saint formed, he had switched from guitar to bass. Vera has cited Geezer Butler, John Deacon, John Entwistle, Larry Graham, Steve Harris, Louis Johnson, John Paul Jones, Geddy Lee, Paul McCartney, Jaco Pastorius, and Verdine White as influences or inspirations to his bass playing. He usually plays bass by using his fingers, though he has used a guitar pick on a few occasions." ;

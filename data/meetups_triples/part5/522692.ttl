        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jamelia Niela Davis (born 11 January 1981) is an English singer, songwriter and television presenter. She has released three studio albums, each of which has reached the Top 40 in the UK, which collectively have spawned eight UK top-ten singles. In addition, Jamelia has won four MOBO Awards, a Q Award and has received nine BRIT Award nominations. Jamelia's professional music career began in 1999, when she released her debut single, \"So High\", followed by a more successful single, \"I Do\". She then released her debut full-length studio album, Drama, in June 2000. Jamelia went on to release further successful singles, including \"Superstar\" which charted at number three on the UK Singles Chart and number one in Australia, where it became platinum certified. She went on to further release another two studio albums, Thank You (2003) and Walk with Me (2006), before leaving Parlophone following a dispute with executives over the release of \"No More\", the third offering from Walk with Me. Jamelia's ten-year-successful career span has led her to becoming a judge on shows such as Move Like Michael Jackson in 2009. Her filmography also includes her own TV documentaries, including Jamelia: Whose Hair Is It Anyway (2008), her own edition of the popular Channel 4 show, The House That Made Me and in 2011, her own BBC Three documentary, Jamelia: Shame About Single Mums. In 2010 she signed a new record deal with All Around the World Productions. She was a panellist on the ITV magazine show Loose Women from 2013 until 2016." ;

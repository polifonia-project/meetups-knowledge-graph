        mtp:hasAbstract        "Aristotle Condenuevo Pollisco (born October 18, 1977), known professionally as Gloc-9, is a Filipino rapper, singer, and songwriter. Regarded as one of the best Filipino rappers of all-time, his fast-flowing vocal style has made him one of the best-selling and most successful hip-hop artists in the Philippines. He was described by fellow Filipino rapper Francis Magalona as \"a blacksmith of words and letters, and a true Filipino poet.\" Recognized as the Philippines' undisputed “King of Hip-Hop”, He is also referred as a trailblazer and the long-standing giant of the Pinoy Hip-Hop scene. In a career spanning 25 years, Gloc-9 has won over 60 awards including the prestigious 'Sudi National Music Award' by the National Commission of Culture and Art. He is also recipient of 2 FAMAS Awards, 21 Awit Awards, 18 Myx Music Awards and 9 PMPC Star Awards. His albums Liham at Lihim (Platinum) and MKNM: Mga Kwento Ng Makata (Gold), both earned sales certifications by the PARI. In 2019, he was inducted at the Calle Con Hall of Fame. He has collaborated on almost a dozen songs with other OPM artists; \"Lando\" with the late Francis M, \"Upuan\" with Jaezelle, \"Bagsakan\" with Parokya ni Edgar , \"Baon\" with Gab Chee Kee of Parokya ni Edgar and Francis M, and \"Sari-Saring Kwento\" with Noel Cabangon and Champ Lui Pio. His songs mostly tackle social issues such as social injustices, poverty and patriotism. He began his musical career with the gangsta rap group Death Threat. Gloc-9 is notably one of the few artists in the Philippine music scene who has won an award in almost every album he released." ;

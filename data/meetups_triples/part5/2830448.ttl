An original member of the band, founded in Southern California in 1979, Emory left in 1987 prior to the release of the album Hit and Run. In 1996, he joined the other original members of T.S.O.L. to reform the band, which remains active. Emory worked on a solo project titled Walk That Walk, which was released on April 15, 2010. Emory played with Social Distortion during their 2006 tour to fill in for his friend Mike Ness, who had broken his wrist in a skateboarding accident." ;

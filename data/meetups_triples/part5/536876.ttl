        mtp:hasAbstract        "David William Sanborn (born July 30, 1945) is an American alto saxophonist. Though Sanborn has worked in many genres, his solo recordings typically blend jazz with instrumental pop and R&B. He released his first solo album Taking Off in 1975, but has been playing the saxophone since before he was in high school. One of the most commercially successful American saxophonists to earn prominence since the 1980s, Sanborn is described by critic Scott Yannow as \"the most influential saxophonist on pop, R&B, and crossover players of the past 20 years.\" He is often identified with radio-friendly smooth jazz, but he has expressed a disinclination for the genre and his association with it." ;

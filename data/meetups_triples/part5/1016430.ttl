He was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the English band Slade, one of the UK's most successful acts of the 1970s. Known for his unique and powerful voice, Holder co-wrote most of Slade's material with bass guitarist Jim Lea including \"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\", \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" and \"Merry Xmas Everybody\". After leaving Slade in 1992, he diversified into television and radio work, notably starring in the ITV comedy-drama series The Grimleys (1999â€“2001)." ;

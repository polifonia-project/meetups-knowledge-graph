        mtp:hasAbstract        "Akinyele Adams (/ˌækɪnˈɛli/), better known by the mononym Akinyele, is an American rapper known for his sexually explicit lyrics, including his 1996 underground radio hit \"Put It in Your Mouth\". He appeared on \"Live at the Barbeque\" off of Main Source's 1991 album Breaking Atoms. His first album, Vagina Diner, was released in 1993. In 2001, he released Anakonda. He is also listed as the composer for Swizz Beatz's 2007 singles \"Money in the Bank\" and \"One Man Band Man\". Since 2010, Akinyele has retired from the rap circuit, and instead opened up the club, V-Live, in 2016 in Miami Beach. Since opening, it has garnered controversy for teetering on being a strip club, which is prohibited in Miami Beach, and for having overly loud music which disturbed the residents living in the area. Due to these and other mounting issues, V-Live was forced to close down in 2019. He is of Nigerian and Costa Rican descent." ;

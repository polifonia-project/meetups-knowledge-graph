        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jeanne-Paule Marie \"Jeannine\" Deckers (17 October 1933 – 29 March 1985), better known as Sœur Sourire (French for ''Smiling Sister'') and often called The Singing Nun in English-speaking countries, was a Belgian singer-songwriter and a member of the Dominican Order in Belgium as Sister Luc Gabriel. She acquired widespread fame in 1963 with the release of the Belgian French song \"Dominique\", which topped the US Billboard Hot 100 and other charts. Owing to confusion over the terms of the recording contract, she was reduced to poverty, and also experienced a crisis of faith, quitting the order, though still remaining a Catholic. She died by suicide with her lifelong partner, Annie Pécher." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lawrence \"Kris\" Parker (born August 20, 1965), better known by his stage names KRS-One (/ˌkeɪ ɑːr ɛs ˈwʌn/; an abbreviation of \"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone\") and Teacha, is an American rapper, lyricist and occasional producer from New York City. He rose to prominence as part of the hip hop group Boogie Down Productions, which he formed with DJ Scott La Rock in the mid-1980s. KRS-One is known for his songs, \"Sound of da Police\", \"Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love)\", and \"My Philosophy\". Boogie Down Productions received numerous awards and critical acclaim in their early years. Following the release of the group's debut album, Criminal Minded, fellow artist Scott La Rock was shot and killed, but KRS-One continued the group, effectively as a solo project. He began releasing records under his own name in 1993. He is politically active, having started the Stop the Violence Movement after Scott's death. He is also a vegan activist, expressed in songs such as \"Beef\". He is widely considered an influence on many hip-hop artists." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Neal Evans Boyd (November 18, 1975 â€“ June 10, 2018) was an American singer who developed an interest in opera after listening to the performances of the Three Tenors. Despite being raised in conditions of poverty within the U.S. state of Missouri, he achieved a degree in music and eventually entered the third season of America's Got Talent, winning that year's competition. In addition to music, he also became involved in politics and conducted performances at many state-wide events across Missouri. Boyd died in June 2018, following complications brought on in his battle against liver disease. His funeral included tributes to his performance, including clips from his participation on America's Got Talent." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Clarence Eckstine (July 8, 1914 â€“ March 8, 1993) was an American jazz and pop singer and a bandleader during the swing and bebop eras. He was noted for his rich, almost operatic bass-baritone voice. In 2019, Eckstine was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award \"for performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.\" His recording of \"I Apologize\" (MGM, 1948) was given the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999. The New York Times described him as an \"influential band leader\" whose \"suave bass-baritone\" and \"full-throated, sugary approach to popular songs inspired singers like Earl Coleman, Johnny Hartman, Joe Williams, Arthur Prysock, and Lou Rawls.\"" ;

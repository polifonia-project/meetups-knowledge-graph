        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lucijan Marija Škerjanc (December 17, 1900 – February 27, 1973) was a Slovene composer, music pedagogue, conductor, musician, and writer who was accomplished on and wrote for a number of musical instruments such as the piano, violin and clarinet. His style reflected late romanticism with qualities of expressionism and impressionism in his pieces, often with a hyperbolic artistic temperament, juxtaposing the dark against melodic phrases in his music. Škerjanc belongs among the most important older composers of modern Slovene music and is a key Slovenian music personality of the 20th century. For his work, he was four times awarded the Prešeren Award. Since 1949, he was a regular member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SAZU)." ;

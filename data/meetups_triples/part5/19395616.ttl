        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kim Petras (born 27 August 1992) is a German singer and songwriter based in Los Angeles, California. Between 2016 and 2020, she released music as an independent artist under her own imprint, BunHead Records, before signing with Amigo and Republic Records in 2021. Petras began recording music as a teenager, releasing her debut extended play One Piece of Tape in 2011. She independently released her debut international single in 2017, \"I Don't Want It at All\", which went on to top several viral music charts on Spotify. The song was followed by Billboard-charting singles \"Feeling of Falling\" (with Cheat Codes), \"Heart to Break\", and \"1, 2, 3 Dayz Up\" (featuring Sophie). Following her early success, Petras released a collection of digital singles which would later comprise her unofficial body of work known as Era 1. Petras released her debut album Clarity, on 28 June 2019. The record was preceded with a nine-week-long promotional campaign, during which Petras released one single per week with an accompanying visual lyric video. Clarity received acclaim from music critics, reached number seven on the Heatseekers Chart and number 26 on the Independent Albums chart. Following this, Petras released her second studio album, Turn Off the Light in October 2019. In 2020, Petras saw further success with her songs \"Malibu\" and \"Broken Glass\", the latter being a collaboration with Kygo. In 2021 Petras signed with Republic Records and released the 7-track EP Slut Pop in 2022. Later in the year Petras released the single \"Unholy\" alongside Sam Smith. It marked Petras' first number one single on the UK Singles Chart and on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also garnered Petras her first Grammy Award nomination, for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance." ;

Thomas founded the math rock band Chore in 1994. After this band broke up in 1996, he joined His Name Is Alive in addition to serving as a member of Lovesick and Flashpapr. He founded the band Saturday Looks Good to Me in 1999, and it released four studio albums before going on hiatus in 2008. He has also released music as a solo artist, beginning with the 2002 album Everything Is Pretty Much Totally Fucked Up. His most recent solo studio album is Aftering, which was released in 2018 and featured Anna Burch and Elliot Bergman. Since then, Fred has moved on to a new guitar rock project, Idle Ray, while continuing to release albums of instrumental electronic music under his own name." ;

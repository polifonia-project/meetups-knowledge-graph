        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter Shapiro (born September 7, 1972) is an American club owner, concert promoter, filmmaker, magazine publisher, author and entrepreneur from New York City. He is widely known as the promoter for Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead, the Grateful Dead's 50th anniversary \"final shows\". Shapiro first gained renown through two films that screened at the Sundance Film Festival: Tie-Died: Rock 'n Roll's Most Deadicated Fans (1995) and American Road (1997). He has gone on to produce numerous other projects including U2 3D (2007) and All Access: Front Row. Backstage. Live! (2001). The Producers Guild of America identified him as one of “The Digital 25: Visionaries, Innovators and Producers of 2009.” On June 8, 2016, Shapiro was honored at the annual gala of the BRIC Celebrate Brooklyn! Festival. In 1996 Shapiro purchased New York City nightclub Wetlands Preserve. He currently owns the Brooklyn Bowl, Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas and the Capitol Theatre. He has helped create such events as the Lockn' Festival, Jammy Awards, Jazz & Colors, the Green Apple Music Festival and Fare Thee Well. Billboard named Shapiro to its Power 100 list in 2015 and 2016 while in 2017 Variety placed him on its New Power of New York List. Peter Shapiro currently serves as publisher of Relix magazine. He is also the founder of FANS, an online community with a focus on the live music experience. Shapiro's other ventures have included GreenOrder, The Hoodie Shop and Stone Fox Bride. On July 8, 2019 he became chairman of HeadCount, the non-profit organization that works with musicians to promote participation in democracy, with a focus on registering voters at live music events. In August 2022 Hachette published Shapiro's book, The Music Never Stops: What Putting on 10,000 Shows Has Taught Me About Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Magic. Kirkus described The Music Never Stops, written with Dean Budnick, as “an entertaining insider's tour of the concert business from a likable guide.”" ;

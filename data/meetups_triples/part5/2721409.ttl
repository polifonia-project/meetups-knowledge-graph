        mtp:hasAbstract        "Debra Killings (born July 7, 1966) is an American singer and bass guitarist, notable for extensive session and background vocal work for LaFace Records and Rowdy Records-based artists such as TLC, Monica, and OutKast. Killings appears on the majority of the recordings in TLC's catalogue, singing background vocals. She also appears on Monica's first two albums (Miss Thang and The Boy is Mine), and has performed both background vocals and bass guitar on several OutKast albums, including ATLiens and Aquemini. In 2002, Killings signed to Verity Records, and she released her debut solo album, a gospel LP entitled Surrender, in 2003. Killings was the singing voice of Paula Patton's character, Angel Davenport, in the film Idlewild. Killings' recognizable voice is spotlighted in \"Moving Cool\", the song that the character of Angel first performs in the movie." ;

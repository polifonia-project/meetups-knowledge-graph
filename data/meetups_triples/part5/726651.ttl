        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donald Clark Osmond (born December 9, 1957) is an American singer, dancer, actor, television host, and former teen idol. Osmond first gained fame performing with four of his elder brothers as the Osmonds, earning several top ten hits and gold albums. Then, in the early 1970s, Osmond began a solo career, earning several additional top ten songs. Osmond further gained fame due to the success of the 1976–1979 variety series Donny & Marie. The Donny & Marie duo also released a series of top ten hits and gold albums and hosted a syndicated and Daytime Emmy Award–nominated 1998–2000 talk show. Most recently, Donny & Marie retired from headlining an 11-year Las Vegas residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas (2008–2019). Osmond also successfully competed on two reality TV shows, winning season 9 of Dancing with the Stars and being named runner-up for season 1 of The Masked Singer. He also hosted the game show Pyramid from 2002 to 2004." ;

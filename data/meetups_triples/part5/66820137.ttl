        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hayden Silas Anhed√∂nia (born March 24, 1998), known professionally as Ethel Cain, is an American singer-songwriter and artist born in Tallahassee, Florida and living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In mid 2017, Cain began experimenting with writing, recording, and producing her own ethereal style, inspired by Christian music and Gregorian chants. After releasing various mixtapes and EPs on streaming platforms under the moniker White Silas, as well as sites like SoundCloud and Tumblr, she adopted a more alternative sound and began using the Ethel Cain moniker in mid 2019. Cain's lyrics focus on nostalgic and Southern Gothic themes, such as poverty, substance abuse, domestic violence, death, and transgenerational trauma. Her music has been associated with the ambient, alternative rock, and dream pop genres. In 2022, Cain released her debut studio album, Preacher's Daughter to widespread acclaim from music critics, many of whom called it one of the best albums of the year." ;

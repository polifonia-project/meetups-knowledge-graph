Before founding Immortal, Abbath performed with Old Funeral alongside future Immortal member Demonaz. While working with Old Funeral, he also joined Demonaz's band Amputation which later became Immortal. He also plays bass in Demonaz's eponymous project. Although he is primarily a guitarist, he is also proficient as a bassist and a drummer, having recorded all drums for Immortal albums Pure Holocaust and Battles in the North. Following his departure from Immortal in 2015, he announced that he would be forming a new band under the Abbath name." ;

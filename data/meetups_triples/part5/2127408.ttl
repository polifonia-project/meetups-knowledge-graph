He is considered the most well-known Swedish singer of the 1950s and 1960s with nicknames including \"The Swedish Frank Sinatra\" and \"World's Oldest Teenager\". Even though by the mid-1970s his career had slowed down, he is still considered arguably Sweden's most popular singer of all time and was long a very popular figure in media." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Malcolm Frederick Evans (27 May 1935 â€“ 5 January 1976) was an English road manager and personal assistant employed by the Beatles from 1963 until their break-up in 1970. In the early 1960s, Evans was employed as a telephone engineer, and also worked part-time as a bouncer at the Cavern Club. The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, later hired Evans as the group's assistant roadie, in tandem with Neil Aspinall. Evans contributed to recordings, and appeared in some of the films the group made. After the Beatles stopped touring in 1966, Evans carried on assisting them until their break-up in 1970. From 1969, Evans also found work as a record producer (most notably with Badfinger's top 10 hit \"No Matter What\"). At age 40, Evans was shot and killed by police at his home in Los Angeles, when he threatened officers with what turned out to be an air rifle." ;

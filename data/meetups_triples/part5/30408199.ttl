She was born in Kharkiv, studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and at the age of 23 had already composed two mature works. She later studied conducting with Felix Weingartner in Basle and piano with Isabelle Vengerova in New York City and taught and performed in Europe and the United States. Aaron Copland dedicated his song \"Heart, We Will Forget Him\" to her. She died in Ojai, California, five months before her 90th birthday." ;

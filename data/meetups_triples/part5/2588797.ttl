        mtp:hasAbstract        "Emilija \"Emina\" Jahović (Serbian Cyrillic: Емилија \"Емина\" Јаховић, pronounced [emǐːna jâːhovit͡ɕ]; born 15 January 1982), also known mononymously as Emina, is a Serbian-Turkish singer-songwriter, actress and businesswoman of Bosniak origin. Born and raised in Novi Pazar, she rose to prominence through music festivals. Jahović released her debut album in 2002, but acquired commercial success with her third record Vila in 2008. Arguably one of the most popular pop performers in the Slavic-speaking territories in the Balkans, she has been referred to as \"pop princeza\" (Pop Princess). Between 2010 and 2014, she starred as Lale Taşkıran Ilgaz in Lale Devri. Jahović also served as a judge on the first season of the X Factor Adria in 2013 and the second season of the Rising Star Turkey in 2016. She released her own perfume called Closer in 2014 and founded beauty brand, Yaemina Beauty, in 2020. Emina is a recognized style icon both in Serbia and Turkey and has been featured in magazines such as Cosmopolitan Serbia, Elele and Vogue Türkiye. Between 2008 and 2018, she was married to singer Mustafa Sandal with whom she has two sons." ;

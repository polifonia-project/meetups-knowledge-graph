        mtp:hasAbstract        "Emilio H. Navaira III (August 23, 1962 â€“ May 16, 2016) was an American singer-songwriter of Tejano and country music. He is the winner of one Grammy Award and one Latin Grammy Award. Known to most by the mononym Emilio, he charted more than ten singles on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks charts, in addition to six singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. Emilio was also one of the few Tejano artists to have significant success in both the United States and Mexico, and was called the \"Garth Brooks of Tejano\". His biggest country hit was the No. 27 \"It's Not the End of the World\" in late 1995, and his highest-charting single on any chart is \"Por Siempre Unidos,\" which peaked at No. 7 on Latin Pop Airplay in 1996. Along with Selena, Emilio was one of the most prominent artists that helped popularize Tejano music." ;

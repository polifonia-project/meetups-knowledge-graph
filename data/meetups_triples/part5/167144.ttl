        mtp:hasAbstract        "Francisco James Muniz IV (/ˈmjuːnɪz/; born December 5, 1985) is an American actor. He is best known for playing the title character in the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle (2000–2006), which earned him an Emmy Award nomination and two Golden Globe Award nominations. He is also known for his film roles in the films Deuces Wild (2002), Big Fat Liar (2002), Agent Cody Banks (2003), and Racing Stripes (2005). At the height of his fame, he was considered one of the most popular child actors and \"one of Hollywood's most bankable teens\" in 2003. In 2008, he put his acting career on hold to pursue an open-wheel racing career, and competed in the Atlantic Championship. From 2012 to 2014, he was the drummer of the indie rock band Kingsfoil." ;

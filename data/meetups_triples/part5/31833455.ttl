In 2005, Buras wrote the hit song \"Crazy Chick\", which she considers autobiographical.In her backstage video interview at NBC's The Voice, she told viewers that she wrote the song in Mississippi on the way to Walmart. Just a few months later, the song was recorded by singer Charlotte Church. It became a hit on the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 2 on the UK Singles Top 75. The song ranked 40th on the 2005 UK Year End Singles Chart. In 2011, Buras became a contestant on the U.S. reality talent show The Voice, which airs on the NBC television network. The premise of the show includes pairing up widely undiscovered vocalists with highly successful recording artists, who serve as vocal coaches and mentors. Serabee was selected as a member of country singer, Blake Shelton's team, assisted by award-winning singer, Reba McEntire." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Erroll Louis Garner (June 15, 1921 â€“ January 2, 1977) was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his swing playing and ballads. His instrumental ballad \"Misty\", his best-known composition, has become a jazz standard. It was first recorded in 1956 with Mitch Miller and his orchestra, and played a prominent part in the motion picture Play Misty for Me. Scott Yanow of Allmusic calls him \"one of the most distinctive of all pianists\" and a \"brilliant virtuoso.\" He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6363 Hollywood Blvd. His live album Concert by the Sea first released in 1955, sold over 1 million copies by 1958, and Yanow's opinion on the album is that it \"made such a strong impression that Garner was considered immortal from then on.\"" ;

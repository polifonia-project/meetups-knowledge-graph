Since the mid-1980s, she has released productions on her own and other record companies, and her pop music has often been characterized by keyboard instruments, experimental songs and a huge measure of drastic humor. In recent years, Jacobi has also served as a producer for other artists. The last album in her name was released in 2009." ;

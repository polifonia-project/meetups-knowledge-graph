Marlon grew up in Queensbridge housing projects located in Queens, New York. He performed in local talent shows during the early days of rap music, further fueling his interest. He was also featured on Eric B. & Rakim's \"Paid in Full\" from their debut album, which was also recorded in his studio. As a producer, one notable project was LL Cool J. He is credited with influencing a number of hip hop icons such as RZA, DJ Premier, Madlib, and Pete Rock. Producer Madlib stated in an interview that Marley was the first producer who inspired him to make beats. Vibe magazine wrote that he, \"forever changed the sound of hip-hop with his unique beat barrages.\"" ;

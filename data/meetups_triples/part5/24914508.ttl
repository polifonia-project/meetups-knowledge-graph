He is best known as a member of G-Unit, a hip hop group he formed with his childhood friends 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks. Yayo released his debut and only studio album, Thoughts of a Predicate Felon, in 2005, which debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200. His stage name is derived from the 1983 film Scarface, referencing the main character Tony Montana, and Yayo, the slang word for cocaine." ;

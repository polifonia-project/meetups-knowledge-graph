        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nancy Sue Wilson (February 20, 1937 â€“ December 13, 2018) was an American singer whose career spanned over five decades, from the mid-1950s until her retirement in the early 2010s. She was especially notable for her single \"(You Don't Know) How Glad I Am\" and her version of the standard \"Guess Who I Saw Today\". Wilson recorded more than 70 albums and won three Grammy Awards for her work. During her performing career, Wilson was labeled a singer of blues, jazz, R&B, pop, and soul; a \"consummate actress\"; and \"the complete entertainer\". The title she preferred, however, was \"song stylist\". She received many nicknames including \"Sweet Nancy\", \"The Baby\", \"Fancy Miss Nancy\" and \"The Girl With the Honey-Coated Voice\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rion Vernon, known by his stage name Doctor Steel (full name, Doctor Phineas Waldolf Steel) is an American musician and internet personality from Los Angeles. He performed on rare occasions with a \"backup band\", claiming that a fictitious robot band had malfunctioned. Shows incorporated puppetry, multimedia and performances by female members (\"Nurses\" and \"Scouts\") of his street team, The Army of Toy Soldiers. Steel made a brief appearance on The Tonight Show and has had numerous interviews. He was the subject of an article in Wired magazine regarding allegations that Dr. Horrible had copied his style. Steel has frequently been cited as an example of steampunk music." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "François Luambo Luanzo Makiadi (6 July 1938 – 12 October 1989) was a Congolese musician. He was a major figure in 20th-century Congolese music, and African music in general, principally as the leader for over 30 years of TPOK Jazz, the most popular and significant African band of its time. He is referred to as Franco Luambo or simply Franco. Known for his mastery of African Rumba, he was nicknamed by fans and critics \"Sorcerer of the Guitar\" and the \"Grand Maître of Zairean Music\", as well as Franco de Mi Amor by female fans. His most known hit, \"Mario\", sold more than 200,000 copies and was certified gold." ;

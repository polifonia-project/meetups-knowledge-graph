Beginning from the 1960s, he was the lyricist for over 2,000 songs, collaborating with songwriter Joseph Koo (a.k.a. Koo Kar-Fai) on many popular television theme songs, many of which have become classics of the genre. His work propelled Cantopop to unprecedented popularity. He was also well known in Asia as a columnist, actor, film director, screenwriter, and talk show host. He took part in creative directing positions within the entertainment industry in Hong Kong. Wong died on 24 November 2004 of lung cancer after a four-year battle at the age of 63." ;

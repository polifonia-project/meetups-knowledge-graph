        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mari Kimura (木村 まり, Kimura Mari) (/kɪˈmʊərə/; born 1962) is a Japanese violinist and composer best known for her use of subharmonics, which, achieved through special bowing techniques, allow pitches below the instrument's normal range. She is credited with \"introducing\" the use of violin subharmonics, which allow a violinist to play a full octave below the low G on the violin without adjusting the tuning of the instrument. She studied violin with Joseph Fuchs, Roman Totenberg, Toshiya Eto, and . She also studied composition with Mario Davidovsky at Columbia University, and computer music at Stanford University. Kimura holds a doctorate in performance from The Juilliard School. Since September 1998, she has been teaching a graduate class in Interactive Computer Music Performance at The Juilliard School.

His musical styles varied from pop and rock music to jazz, electronic music and contemporary classical music. Donner's personal instrument was trumpet. He was a member of the famous Finland Swedish Donner family. Donner was one of the pioneers of Finnish avant-garde and experimental music as well as an important figure in Finnish left-wing \"song movement\" of the 1960s and 1970s. He studied at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and later in Vienna as a student of György Ligeti. In 1966 Donner was one of the founders of record label Love Records which was a pioneering label in Finnish rock music.

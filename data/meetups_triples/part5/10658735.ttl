        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gauhar Jaan (born Angelina Yeoward; 26 June 1873 â€“ 17 January 1930) was an Indian singer and dancer from Kolkata. She was one of the first performers to record music on 78 rpm records in India, which was later released by the Gramophone Company of India and resulted in her being known as \"the Gramophone girl\" and \"the first recording superstar of India\". Having recorded more than 600 songs in more than ten languages between 1902 and 1920, Jaan is credited with popularising Hindustani classical music such as thumri, dadra, kajri, and tarana during the period." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Esthero (/ɛˈstɛroʊ/ es-TER-oh; born Jenny-Bea Englishman on December 23, 1978 in Stratford, Ontario) is a Canadian singer-songwriter who lives in Los Angeles, California. The name Esthero refers both to the singer and formerly to the two-person team of herself and producer Doc McKinney. Esthero is a portmanteau of \"Esther the hero\"; she claims to have gotten the name by combining the name of the heroine (Esther) and last line (\"If I am to be the hero, then I cannot fly from darkness\") of the film from Sylvia Plath's novel The Bell Jar. Esthero's sound characteristically features her voice over a mix of mellow bass lines, jazzy trumpets, Spanish guitar and hip-hop. She is sometimes compared to artists Björk, Portishead, Billie Holiday, and Sade. She has co-produced the majority of the material she performed. Later female artists who count Esthero among their influences include Res, Fergie and fellow Canadian Nelly Furtado. Esthero's brother, Jason Englishman, is also a musician." ;

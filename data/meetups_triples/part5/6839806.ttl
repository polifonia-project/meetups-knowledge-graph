He was developing both one- and two-handed tapping style in the early 1970s. He published a CD of his own music in 1995, \"To Love\" under the name Randy Rare. There is an example of his tapping work in the recording from that CD below. In 2020, he began publishing new music, much of it on saxophone, on the streaming platforms like Spotify, Tidal (service) and iTunes under his own Each Hit label." ;

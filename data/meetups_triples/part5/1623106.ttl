        mtp:hasAbstract        "Dwight Equan Grant (born March 6, 1974), better known by his stage name Beanie Sigel, is an American rapper from South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He first became known for his association with Jay-Z and Roc-A-Fella Records, releasing his debut studio album The Truth through Roc-A-Fella in February 2000 to critical and commercial success. Sigel's second studio album, The Reason, saw similar commercial success, but received mixed reviews from critics. His third album, The B. Coming, was critically acclaimed and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. After a short break from music, Sigel returned to Roc-A-Fella in 2007 and released his fourth studio album The Solution in December 2007 to positive reviews. After leaving Roc-A-Fella once again, Sigel's fifth and sixth studio albums, The Broad Street Bully and This Time were released independently in 2009 and 2012, respectively. Sigel is also known for his numerous legal issues, including a trial for attempted murder that took place between 2004 and 2005, and eventually lead to Sigel's acquittal." ;

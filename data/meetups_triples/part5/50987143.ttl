        mtp:hasAbstract        "Pierre Eugène Marcellin Berthelot FRS FRSE (French: [bɛʁtəlo]; 25 October 1827 – 18 March 1907) was a French chemist and Republican politician noted for the Thomsen–Berthelot principle of thermochemistry. He synthesized many organic compounds from inorganic substances, providing a large amount of counter-evidence to the theory of Jöns Jakob Berzelius that organic compounds required organisms in their synthesis.Berthelot was convinced that chemical synthesis would revolutionize the food industry by the year 2000, and that synthesized foods would replace farms and pastures. \"Why not\", he asked, \"if it proved cheaper and better to make the same materials than to grow them?\" He was considered \"one of the most famous chemists in the world.\" Upon being appointed to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs for the French government in 1895, he was considered \"the most eminent living chemist\" in France. In 1901, he was elected as one of the \"Forty Immortals\" of the Académie française.He gave all his discoveries not only to the French government but to humanity." ;

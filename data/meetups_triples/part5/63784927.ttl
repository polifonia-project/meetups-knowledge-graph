Au5's music encompasses a range of electronic genres such as dubstep, house, trance, drum and bass, drumstep and ambient, and he is known for fusing the characteristics of trance and dubstep in his music. Au5 is best known for his releases on Canadian label Monstercat, some of which have received millions of views on YouTube. Au5's label releases began in 2012, and after winning a Seven Lions remix contest in January 2013, he joined Monstercat. Au5 had several successful releases on the label, such as \"Halcyon\", with American producer Fractal, \"Snowblind\", featuring Tasha Baxter, and \"Crossroad\", featuring Danyka Nadeau. \"Halcyon\" and \"Snowblind\" reached number one on Beatport's dubstep charts.

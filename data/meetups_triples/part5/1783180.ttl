The daughter of actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, she has received various accolades, including a Young Artist Award, an NAACP Image Award, a BET Award, and nominations for two Daytime Emmy Awards and a MTV Video Music Award. Smith made her acting debut in 2007 in the film I Am Legend along with her father Will Smith, and later appeared in Kit Kittredge: An American Girl alongside Abigail Breslin. In 2010, Smith launched her music career with the platinum-certified single \"Whip My Hair\", which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. Smith later signed to her mentor Jay-Z's record label Roc Nation, becoming the youngest artist signed to the label, and released the single \"21st Century Girl\" the following year. Smith's debut album, Ardipithecus, was released in 2015. Its single \"Wait a Minute!\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Smith would later release her second album The 1st (2017), and her third album Willow (2019). Smith began co-hosting the Facebook Watch talk show Red Table Talk in 2018, which has earned her two NAACP Image Awards and two Daytime Emmy Award nominations. In 2021, Smith released her fourth album Lately I Feel Everything, which spawned the single \"Transparent Soul\", which was certified gold in the US. Later that year, she earned another top 40 entry on the Billboard Hot 100 with the single \"Meet Me at Our Spot\" as part of The Anxiety with Tyler Cole." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jason Costa (born November 5, 1972) is an American musician, best known as the former drummer for the band Diecast, and the current drummer for the band All That Remains. He has been with All That Remains since late 2006, joining almost immediately after Shannon Lucas left the band. Jason has drummed for six All That Remains albums: Overcome, For We Are Many, A War You Cannot Win, The Order of Things, Madness, and Victim of the New Disease. He is notable for being one of the few heavy metal drummers to play solely with the 'traditional grip'." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jason Joel Desrouleaux (born September 21, 1989), known professionally as Jason Derulo (/dəˈruːloʊ/; formerly stylized as Derülo), is an American singer and songwriter. Since the start of his solo recording career in 2009, he has sold over 30 million singles and has achieved eleven platinum singles including \"Wiggle\", \"Talk Dirty\", \"Want to Want Me\", \"Trumpets\", \"It Girl\", \"In My Head\", \"Ridin' Solo\", and \"Whatcha Say\". After contributing and writing songs for various artists, Derulo signed to recording label Beluga Heights, owned by record producer and industry veteran J. R. Rotem. After Beluga Heights became part of the Warner Music Group, Derulo became a recording artist and released his debut single \"Whatcha Say\" in May 2009. It sold over five million digital downloads, gaining an RIAA certification of triple platinum, and reaching number one in the U.S. and New Zealand. Derulo released his second single, \"In My Head\", in December 2009 and his self-titled debut studio album Jason Derulo, followed on March 2, 2010. He released his second album, Future History, on September 16, 2011; the album was preceded by the release of the UK number-one single \"Don't Wanna Go Home\". Derulo's third international album, Tattoos, was released on September 24, 2013, and later repackaged as his third U.S. album, Talk Dirty, released on April 15, 2014. In 2015, Derulo released his single \"Want to Want Me\" and announced his fourth studio album, Everything Is 4, which was released on June 2, 2015. In June 2020, Derulo released the single \"Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)\" alongside beat producer Jawsh 685. The song went viral on TikTok and was later remixed by BTS, wherein the remix reached number one in the US, becoming Derulo's second chart-topper in the region. In November 2020, Derulo released another single entitled \"Love Not War (The Tampa Beat)\" featuring New Caledonian beat producer Nuka. It was inspired from the latter's SoundCloud track known as \"The Tampa Beat\" which was earlier released in 2018, and has been used in over 23 million TikTok videos." ;

Regarded as the Dean of American jazz bass players, his nicknames included \"Sporty\" from his years in Chicago, \"Fump\" from his time on the road with Cab Calloway, and \"The Judge\" from the 1950s and beyond. Hinton's recording career lasted over 60 years, mostly in jazz but also with a variety of other genres as a prolific session musician. He was also a photographer of note, praised for documenting American jazz during the 20th Century." ;

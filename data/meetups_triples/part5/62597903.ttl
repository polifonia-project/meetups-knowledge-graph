        mtp:hasAbstract        "Emilie Marie Dagmar Borup (née Alexandersen; 25 February 1867 – 14 January 1959) was a Danish pianist and music educator. She is remembered in particular for introducing ear training into the curriculum of the Royal Danish Academy of Music and related institutions. She adapted and expanded the approach she had learnt in Rome, Berlin and Paris by publishing textbooks and demonstrating it to students in Sweden and the Netherlands. Thanks to Borup, ear training became a key aspect of education offered by her students, including the organist Ebba Nielsen and the pianist Merete Westergaard." ;

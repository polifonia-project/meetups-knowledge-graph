Bales began to play piano at age twelve, and played in hotels and nightclubs in California in the 1930s. He played regularly in San Francisco in the 1940s, with Lu Watters's Yerba Buena Jazz Band, but was drafted in 1943 and only recorded with that group on one brief session with Bunk Johnson.

He recorded extensively for Good Time Jazz, Arhoolie, ABC-Paramount, and ." ;

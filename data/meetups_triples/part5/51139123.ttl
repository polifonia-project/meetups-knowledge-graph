        mtp:hasAbstract        "Walter Anthony \"Tony\" Bradford (born March 3, 1989), better known by his stage name Montana of 300 (or simply Montana), is an American rapper, singer and songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. His debut studio album, Fire in the Church, was released on May 20, 2016. He is best known for his rap style, incorporating trap, R&B, and drill beats, while also making remixes to hit songs that, like his originals, often include religious subtext. Since releasing Fire in the Church, Montana has committed to releasing an album every year on May 20. The significance of the date is unknown. His second album, Don't Doubt the God, was released on May 20, 2017, and his third album, Pray 4 the Devil, was released on May 20, 2018. His fourth album, A Gun In The Teacherâ€™s Desk, was released on November 16, 2018, and on May 20, 2019, Montana would release his fifth album, Views from the General's Helmet. Montana has repeatedly announced that his sixth album, Rap God, would be his final solo release. After several delays dating back to 2019, the album was finally released on January 6, 2022." ;

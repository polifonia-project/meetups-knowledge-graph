        mtp:hasAbstract        "Patricia Lynn Yearwood (born September 19, 1964) is an American singer, actress, author and television personality. She rose to fame with her 1991 debut single \"She's in Love with the Boy,\" which became a number one hit on the Billboard country singles chart. Its corresponding self-titled debut album would sell over two million copies. Yearwood continued with a series of major country hits during the early to mid-1990s, including \"Walkaway Joe\" (1992), \"The Song Remembers When\" (1993), \"XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)\" (1994), and \"Believe Me Baby (I Lied)\" (1996). Yearwood's 1997 single \"How Do I Live\" reached number two on the U.S. country singles chart and was internationally successful. It appeared on her first compilation (Songbook) A Collection of Hits (1997). The album certified quadruple-platinum in the United States and featured the hits \"In Another's Eyes\" and \"Perfect Love.\" Yearwood had a string of commercial successes over the next several years including the hit singles \"There Goes My Baby\" and \"I Would've Loved You Anyway.\" She released her tenth studio record Jasper County in 2005, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and the top ten of the Billboard 200. It would become her fastest-selling album in the United States. Yearwood signed with Big Machine Records in 2007 and released the critically acclaimed Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love the same year. Yearwood spent several years on hiatus from her own musical career to focus on other projects. She published three successful cookbooks, which appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2012, she began a culinary television series on the Food Network called Trisha's Southern Kitchen, which later won a Daytime Emmy Award. Yearwood has sold over 15 million records worldwide. Her work has earned her several awards and nominations, including three Grammy Awards, three awards from the Academy of Country Music, and three awards from the Country Music Association. Yearwood has also been a cast member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1999. Since 2005 she has been married to country singer Garth Brooks, with whom she has collaborated on a number of occasions." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Roger Pomfret Hodgson (born 21 March 1950) is an English musician, singer and songwriter, best known as the former co-frontman and founding member of progressive rock band Supertramp. Hodgson composed and sang the majority of the bandâ€™s hits, including \"Dreamer\", \"Give a Little Bit\", \"Take the Long Way Home\", \"The Logical Song\", \"It's Raining Again\", and \"Breakfast in America.\" In 1983, Hodgson left Supertramp and moved his family away from Los Angeles to live a simpler lifestyle close to nature. After releasing two solo albums in 1984 and 1987, he took a break from his music career to spend time with his children as they were growing up. He returned to touring in 1997, and released a third solo album in 2000. Hodgson often writes about spiritual and philosophical topics, and his lyrics have been described as personal and meaningful." ;

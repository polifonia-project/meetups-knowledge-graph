        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1996), known professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper. Carter was initially signed to local underground label Awful Records prior to signing with ASAP Mob's AWGE Label under Interscope Records. After gaining a cult following early in his career, Carter garnered mainstream attention in 2017. Carter's debut mixtape was released in April 2017, and included the Billboard Hot 100 charting singles \"Magnolia\" and \"Woke Up Like This\" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert). His debut studio album Die Lit (2018) peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200. Following a two-year hiatus with little-to-no new music released, Carter's highly anticipated second album, Whole Lotta Red (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and became his first chart-topping release. Aside from his solo career, Carter established his Opium record label in 2019 which has since signed artists such as Ken Carson and Destroy Lonely." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Claude Caputo, (July 12, 1921 â€“ March 7, 2016), known professionally as Joe Cabot, was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and musical director. His composition \"Slow Down, Sugar, Take Your Time,\" was praised by music critic John Wilson and likened to the stylings of the Nat Cole Trio. In addition to trumpet, Cabot played the flugelhorn. Cabot was born in Cleveland, Ohio into a musical family led by his father Joseph and uncle August. His first performances took place locally while he was still a small boy, and by 1939 Cabot was performing as a sideman for drummer Gene Krupa. He also worked with the Dorsey Brothers, Claude Thornhill, and Artie Shaw. Regarding his time with Tommy Dorsey Cabot stated, \"When you were with big bands in those days you lived in an iron lung in that bus. But you were part of a family.\" Over six decades, Cabot worked with Peggy Lee, Ruth Brown, Chris Connor, Eartha Kitt, Anita O'Day, Fran Warren, Tony Bennett, Dizzy Gillespie, Gerry Mulligan, Oscar Peterson, Stan Getz, and Harry James. He maintained a close relationship with James until the latter's death in 1983. In 1981 Cabot conducted an eight-piece jazz band at Michael's Pub in New York City to accompany singer Fran Warren. For 30 years he performed on television as part of the Cerebral Palsy and Muscular Dystrophy telethons. He died on March 7, 2016 at the age of 94." ;

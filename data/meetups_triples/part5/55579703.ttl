Rashad grew up alongside notable hip hop artists such as Mos Def, Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip, among others. At the age of 19, he provided beats to Main Source, Eric B and Rakim and A Tribe Called Quest. He proceeded further into the music business by working directly with Andre Harrell at the newly minted Uptown Records. While at Uptown, Rashad met session keyboardist Avon Marshell with whom he formed Tumblin Dice. The duo went on to produce for Uptown's biggest artist's, including Mary J. Blige and Jodeci's early albums. Tumblin Dice would go on to become resident producers for the recently formed Bad Boy Records, after Sean \"Puffy\" Combs requested Rashad join his production team The Hitmen. During this time, Rashad produced chart topping hits. Rashad continued his chart topping success after composing Busta Rhymes first hit single, \"Woo Hah!! Got You All in Check\".

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Takanori Nishikawa (西川 貴教, Nishikawa Takanori, born September 19, 1970) is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, voice artist, radio personality, and businessman. He performs under the stage name T.M.Revolution (TMR), which stands for \"Takanori Makes Revolution\" (貴教が革命を起こす, Takanori ga kakumei o okosu), stemming from the famous '80s pop electronic band TM Network. Despite most of his songs being written by Akio Inoue and composed/arranged by Daisuke Asakura (also TMR's former producer), T.M.Revolution is considered Nishikawa's solo project. Nishikawa is also known for contributions of ending and opening themes to many notable anime and game series. Nishikawa debuted as TMR with the release of his first single \"Dokusai (Monopolize)\" (独裁 -monopolize-) in May 1996. Later that year, his third single \"Heart of Sword (Yoake Mae)\" (HEART OF SWORD ～夜明け前～) was used as the third ending song for the anime series Rurouni Kenshin, further expanding his fan base. He also contributed six songs to the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED franchise – three for Gundam SEED and three for Gundam SEED Destiny. Nishikawa has guest starred as a minor character in each of those anime series that featured his songs. In 2010, his single \"Save the One, Save the All\" was used as the ending theme song for the movie Bleach: Hell Verse. Several of Nishikawa's songs, such as \"Crosswise\" and \"Flags\", have been used by Capcom's Sengoku Basara video game series and media franchise. T.M.Revolution was the first artist to be signed to Tofu Records, a record label (affiliated with Sony Music Japan) promoting Japanese artists in North America. Tofu released three of his most recent studio albums: coordinate (2003), Seventh Heaven (2004), and vertical infinity (2005). Nishikawa made his North American live debut at Otakon, a large anime convention in 2003. He has also performed at Pacific Media Expo in 2004 and at the New York Comic Con in 2008. Nishikawa revisited his 2003 US performance at the Asian culture convention Otakon by performing at Otakon's 20th Anniversary on August 10, 2013." ;

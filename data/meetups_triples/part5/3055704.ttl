After leaving the Brazilian thrash metal band Korzus, Confessori was invited for assume the post of drummer of Angra, after the recording of the album Angels Cry. In 2000, Confessori left Angra with singer Andre Matos and bassist Luis Mariutti to form the band Shaman together with guitarist Hugo Mariutti. Shaman released three albums with this line-up: Ritual (2002); RituAlive (live album, released in CD and DVD in 2003); and Reason, in 2005.

In 2009, Confessori returned to Angra, replacing the drummer Aquiles Priester. In 2014 it was announced that he had once again left the band. In 2016, he was announced as the new drummer for folk metal band Tierramystica.

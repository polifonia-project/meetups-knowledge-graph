        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ben Liebrand (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈbɛn ˈli.brɑnt]) (born 27 September 1960 in Nijmegen, the Netherlands) is a Dutch dance music DJ and remixer. He has produced for artists such as Forrest and MC Miker G & DJ Sven and remixed tracks by artists such as Alexander O'Neal, Salt-N-Pepa, Sting, TLC, Fun Fun, Tavares, The Limit, Bill Withers, Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons, Hot Chocolate, Pia Zadora, The Doobie Brothers, The Art Of Noise, Dimples D and Phil Collins. He has also seen success under his own name, a prime example being his remix of Jeff Wayne's \"The Eve of the War\", which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart in 1989. His radio show \"In the Mix\" was the first non-stop mixed show that aired on Dutch National Radio on April 2, 1983. Early listeners were Armin van Buuren, Tiësto (Tijs Verwest), Olav Basoski, DJ Jean, Ferry Corsten and DJ Dano (Daniël Leeflang), who have cited Liebrand as their main reason for entering the music business. \"In The Mix\" also spawned an annual yearmix with 100+ tracks called \"The Grandmix.\" The first series of Grandmixes aired from 1983 till 1992. There were only two Grandmixes (1988 and 1989) that were released on limited edition CD exclusively for members of the UK Disco Mix Club. The Grandmix 1990 was planned to follow, but was cancelled (after being pressed) due to changes in copyright rules in the UK. The later Grandmixes from 1999 till 2018 were aired and also released on a 3 CD Box by Sony BMG records." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Amelia Toomey (born 6 December 1997), known professionally as Girli, is an English singer and songwriter. Based in London, she has released a number of singles and three EPs. The Guardian has described her sound as veering \"between PC Music, bubblegum pop, pop punk and rap, each one treading a line between catchy and deliberately discomforting.\" Much of her music is about feminism, sexuality, queer culture, and mental health. In April 2019, Girli released her debut studio album, Odd One Out, on PMR Records. After being dropped by her record label and later being forced to cancel her 2020 Sofa Tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Girli released the EP Ex Talk in 2021. She is currently with independent label AllPoints." ;

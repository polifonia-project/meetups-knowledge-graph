He recorded sixteen songs between 1927 and 1928, of which fourteen were released on record. AllMusic noted that Harris was \"a fine second-level blues and folksong performer\". His best known works are \"Kansas City Blues,\" \"Early Mornin' Blues,\" and \"Hot Time Blues.\" Details of Harris's life outside of his brief recording career are minimal." ;

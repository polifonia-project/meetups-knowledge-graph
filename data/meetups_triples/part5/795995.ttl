        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Dorian Goodman (April 19, 1934 â€“ November 6, 1989), known as Dickie Goodman, was an American music and record producer born in Brooklyn, New York. He is best known for inventing and using the technique of the \"break-in\", an early precursor to sampling, that used brief clips of popular records and songs to \"answer\" comedic questions posed by voice actors on his novelty records. He also wrote and produced some original material, most often heard on the B-sides of his break-in records. He died from suicide by gunshot on December 6, 1989." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Percy Lee Chapman (born August 13, 1971), known by his stage name Tragedy Khadafi (formerly Intelligent Hoodlum), is an American rapper and record producer. Chapman hails from the Queensbridge Housing Projects in Queens, New York City, who helped spawn other hip hop artists such as Mobb Deep, Capone-N-Noreaga, Nas and many others both through production and influence. He was the first in the Queensbridge projects to create intelligent street music, and is documented to be the first to use the phrase \"Illmatic\" in 1988 on a record called \"The Rebel\", from the Marley Marl album In Control, Volume 1, which was an inspiration and influence on fellow New York rapper Nas." ;

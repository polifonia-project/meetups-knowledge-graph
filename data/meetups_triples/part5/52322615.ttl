        mtp:hasAbstract        "Everett Millard \"Ev\" Gilmore, Jr. (December 13, 1935 – April 14, 2005) was an American tubist best known for his association with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, in which he served as principal tubist from 1965 until his retirement in 1995. He was also closely associated with the University of North Texas College of Music and Southern Methodist University. Gilmore’s thirty-year tenure was one of the longest with an American orchestra for this time period. He was also one of the few American orchestral tubists during his time who played BBb tuba as their primary instrument. Gilmore had a diverse influence on music in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, not only as a performer but as teacher and mentor to other professional musicians." ;

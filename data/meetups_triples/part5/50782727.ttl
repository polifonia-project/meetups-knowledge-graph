        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Cory Bryar (born December 31, 1979) is an American retired musician and sound engineer best known as the drummer of the rock band My Chemical Romance. The longest tenured and last official drummer, he performed in the band from 2004 until his departure in 2010. Bryar joined the band replacing former drummer Matt Pelissier shortly after the release of their second studio album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge (2004). He performed on all of the subsequent releases in support of the album, as well as the band's commercially successful concept album, The Black Parade (2006). Despite suffering numerous injuries while on tour, Bryar continued to tour with the band and joined them in the studio to record their fourth studio album before departing from My Chemical Romance in 2010. His most recent contribution was performing on the band's final release before their break-up in 2013, Conventional Weapons. After his departure from the band, Bryar became a behind-the-scenes figure in tours for several bands before retiring from music in 2014. He subsequently became a real estate agent and an active supporter of dog rescue charities and sanctuaries." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Slim Dusty, AO MBE (born David Gordon Kirkpatrick; 13 June 1927 â€“ 19 September 2003) was an Australian country music singer-songwriter, guitarist and producer. He was an Australian cultural icon and one of the country's most awarded stars, with a career spanning nearly seven decades and producing numerous recordings. He was known to record songs in the legacy of Australia, particularly of bush life and renowned Australian bush poets Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson that represented the lifestyle. The music genre was coined the \"bush ballad\", a style first made popular by Buddy Williams, the first artist to perform the genre in Australia, and also for his many trucking songs. Slim Dusty \"released more than a hundred albums, selling more than seven million records and earning over 70 gold and platinum album certifications\". He was the first Australian to have a No. 1 international hit song, with a version of Gordon Parsons' \"A Pub with No Beer\". He received 38 Golden Guitar and an Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) award. He was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and Australian Roll of Renown. At the time of his death, at the age of 76, Dusty had been working on his 106th album for EMI Records. In 2007, his domestic record sales in Australia surpassed seven million. During his lifetime, Dusty was considered an Australian National Treasure. He performed \"Waltzing Matilda\", a very famous song in Australia, at the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games." ;

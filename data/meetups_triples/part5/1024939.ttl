        mtp:hasAbstract        "Anne Lilia Berge Strand (born 21 November 1977), known professionally as Annie, is a Norwegian singer, songwriter, record producer and DJ. She began her recording career in 1999 with the underground hit single \"The Greatest Hit\" and gained international acclaim, particularly from music bloggers, for her debut album Anniemal (2004). After completing secondary school, Annie started DJing in Bergen, where she met house producer and soon-to-be boyfriend Tore Kroknes. In 1999, Annie and Kroknes released the single \"The Greatest Hit\", which sold out in two days and became popular in Norwegian and British nightclubs. Before Annie and Kroknes could release an album, Kroknes died from a congenital heart defect in 2001. Annie went on to sign a record deal with Britain's 679 Recordings in 2003, releasing her debut album Anniemal in 2004, for which she received widespread critical acclaim and several Norwegian music awards. She released her second studio album, Don't Stop, on the Smalltown Supersound label in 2009. Annie lives in Berlin. Annie has been described as \"a pop singer with credibility, an indie artist with one eye on the dancefloor\" and as \"the Norwegian Kylie\". Annie describes her music as \"pop with strange edges\"." ;

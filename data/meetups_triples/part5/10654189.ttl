        mtp:hasAbstract        "Miroslav Ilić (Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic: Мирослав Илић; born 10 December 1950) is a popular Serbian folk singer-songwriter and philanthropist. He is known for his powerful vocals and emotional lyrics. With 25 albums, he is one of the best-selling performers in the history of Serbian music. Nicknamed 'Slavuj iz Mrčajevaca' (The Nightingale from Mrčajevci), he has worked together with several popular Serbian musicians such as Lepa Brena. In recent times, he has spoken out against the new generation of Serbian music videos, claiming that music videos are becoming more and more sexually suggestive and inappropriate for general audiences." ;

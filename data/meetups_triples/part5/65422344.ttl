        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brown Moore Meggs (October 20, 1930 â€“ October 8, 1997) was an American writer and music executive with Capitol Records. Meggs is known for signing the Beatles to their first distribution contract in the United States. He started the music magazine TeenSet for Capitol in 1964, and founded Seraphim Records, a bargain label for classical music. After serving Capitol as chief operating officer for two years, he resigned in 1976 to concentrate on his writing. Capitol enticed him back in 1984 as the president of Angel Records; he revived the label for the digital age. As a writer, he won Best Documentary from the Cowboy Hall of Fame for the 1962 documentary film Appaloosa, and he was nominated for the Edgar Award for his mystery novel Saturday Games (1974)." ;

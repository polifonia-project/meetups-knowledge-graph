        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ben Granfelt (born 16 June 1963) is a guitarist from Helsinki, Finland and best known from his work in Leningrad Cowboys, Wishbone Ash, Gringos Locos, Guitar Slingers and his solo band Ben Granfelt Band. Granfelt's most active and recent band named Ben Granfelt Band was formed in 1993 and since then they have toured clubs and festivals in Finland, United Kingdom, Germany, United States, Austria, Switzerland and United Arab Emirates where they appeared at the Abu Dhabi and Dubai Jazz Festivals. Ben Granfelt Band's latest album Kaleidoscope was released on 4 February 2009 in Finland with the rest of Europe following later that spring. Ben Granfelt Band began working on their 11th album in February 2010 but Granfelt's family issues forced him to put both the album and the band on hiatus in June 2010. Soon after making this decision, Granfelt was asked to join Finnish Rock'n'roll sensation Los Bastardos Finlandeses by the band's lead singer Bryn Jones. It did not take too long for Granfelt to join Los Bastardos Finlandeses full-time and contribute to songwriting for their next album. Granfelt has achieved nidan (二段:にだん) second degree black belt in karate and black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu." ;

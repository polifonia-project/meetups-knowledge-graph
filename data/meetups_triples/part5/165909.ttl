A seven-time Grammy Award-winner, Knight recorded hits through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s with her family group Gladys Knight & the Pips, which included her brother Merald \"Bubba\" Knight and cousins William Guest and Edward Patten. Knight has recorded two number-one Billboard Hot 100 singles (\"Midnight Train to Georgia\" and \"That's What Friends Are For\" which she did with Dionne Warwick, Sir Elton John and Stevie Wonder), eleven number-one R&B singles and six number-one R&B albums. She has won seven Grammy Awards (four as a solo artist and three with the Pips) and is an inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Vocal Group Hall of Fame along with The Pips. Two of her songs (\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and \"Midnight Train to Georgia\") were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for \"historical, artistic and significant\" value. She also recorded the theme song for the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Knight among the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time." ;

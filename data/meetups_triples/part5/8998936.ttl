She was formerly an editor at 2GQ (2 Gyrlz Quarterly), Anodyne magazine, , and FringeWare Review. Her writing has appeared in Utne, Tin House, Oregon Humanities, Wired, Bust, and Bookforum.

Inara Verzemnieks wrote in The Oregonian: \"As an artist, she had always sought to be fearless, to tackle difficult subjects, to provoke discussion. 'With Tiffany, things are not theoretical,\" says Stephanie Snyder, curator and director of the Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery at Reed College. 'With her, it's always about the lived issues.'\" Brown has been affiliated with the dUdU art collective since the early 1990s.

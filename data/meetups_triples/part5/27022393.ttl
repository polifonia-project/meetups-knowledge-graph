        mtp:hasAbstract        "Luke Anthony \"Jocko\" Johnson (born 11 March 1981) is an English rock musician, drummer and songwriter. He is most commonly known as 'Jocko'. Johnson began his music career in the late 1990s drumming for a spree of small local West Midlands- punk and metal bands. In early 2003 Johnson was approached by California punk band Amen to join the ranks. After his departure from Amen in 2005, Johnson formed Beat Union as drummer and songwriter with Dave Warsop, Dean Ashton and Mark Andrews. Johnson joined the Welsh alternative metal band Lostprophets in 2009 until their disbanding in 2013. Johnson has also been involved in other musical projects, including working alongside Producer John Feldmann (Good Charlotte, The Used, Kelly Clarkson) and has performed session work for a variety of bands, including The Wonder Stuff and Foxy Shazam." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hugh Lawson (March 12, 1935 â€“ March 11, 1997), was an American jazz pianist from Detroit who worked with Yusef Lateef for more than 10 years. Inspired by Bud Powell, Hampton Hawes and Bill Evans, Lawson first gained recognition for his work with Lateef from 1957 onwards. He recorded with Harry \"Sweets\" Edison (1962), Roy Brooks, and Lateef again on several occasions in the 1960s. In 1972, he performed with \"The Piano Choir\" (Strata-East), a group with seven pianists including Stanley Cowell and Harold Mabern. He went on to tour with Charles Mingus in 1975 and 1977 and made recordings with Charlie Rouse (1977), George Adams, and as a leader. Lawson died of colon cancer in White Plains, NY, March 11, 1997, at the age of 61." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "John Tempesta (born September 26, 1964) is an American drummer known for his work in hard rock and heavy metal. He has been a member of the Cult since 2006. Previously, Tempesta played with several bands including Exodus, Testament and White Zombie. He worked with former White Zombie singer Rob Zombie as a solo artist and served as drum technician for Charlie Benante, drummer for the heavy metal band Anthrax earlier in his career. He is referenced in Anthrax's rendition of \"Friggin' in the Riggin'\" (from their 1989 EP Penikufesin), with lyrics about the band's crew members. Additionally he also played the role of the \"Not Man\" during Anthrax's early live shows footage of which can be seen in the \"Antisocial\" music video. In 1997 he had a brief tenure as the drummer for the band Prong before they disbanded later the same year. In 2000, he played drums on the song \"Meat\", from Tony Iommi's self-titled solo album. He played with the band Helmet in 2004â€“2005. In October 2004, he recorded with the band Scum of the Earth. The band was composed of John and his brother Mike Tempesta who was formerly the guitarist of Powerman 5000, Riggs (former Rob Zombie guitarist), John Dolmayan (System of a Down), Seven, and Clay Campbell. They released Blah...Blah...Blah...Love Songs for the New Millennium, a pop-heavy release reminiscent of the White Zombie / Rob Zombie sound, produced by Ben Burkhardt at Belt of Orion Recording in Hollywood. On February 14, 2006, he was hired by the Cult. In April 2011, he recorded drum samples and MIDI grooves for a Toontrack expansion to drum emulation software EZdrummer, called Metal Machine EZX.

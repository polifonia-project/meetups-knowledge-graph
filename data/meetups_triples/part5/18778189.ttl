G-Dragon is the recipient of numerous awards, including seven Mnet Asian Music Awards, six Melon Music Awards, two Korean Music Awards, two Golden Disc Awards, two MBC Entertainment Awards, among several other awards. Additionally, he is the first and only solo artist to receive the Mnet Asian Music Award for Artist of the Year in 2013. Born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, G-Dragon officially debuted in 2006 and rose to prominence as the leader of the South Korean group Big Bang, which went on to become one of the best-selling boy bands in the world. In 2009, he released his first solo album Heartbreaker; the album and its title track of the same name were commercially successful, becoming the best-selling album by a Korean soloist at the time and earning him Album of the Year at the 2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards. This was followed by a collaboration with fellow Big Bang member T.O.P for the album GD & TOP in 2010. His first EP One of a Kind (2012), spawned three singles: \"One of a Kind\", \"Crayon\", and the chart-topper \"That XX\". The EP earned Best Album at the 2013 Seoul Music Awards. In 2013, he embarked on his first worldwide tour as a solo artist, making him the first Korean soloist to tour Japanese dome arenas. His 2017 EP, Kwon Ji Yong, yielded the number one single \"Untitled, 2014\", and the supporting concert tour Act III: M.O.T.T.E became the largest tour ever conducted by a Korean soloist. Widely recognized for his influence on youth culture, fashion trends, and music in South Korea, G-Dragon was named by Forbes in 2016 as the most influential person under 30 in Asia's entertainment and sports. G-Dragon has written or co-written 23 number one songs on the Gaon Digital Chart most of which he has also co-produced." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sidney De Paris (May 30, 1905 – September 13, 1967) was an American jazz trumpeter. His brother was Wilbur de Paris. He was a member of Charlie Johnson's Paradise Ten (1926–1931), worked with Don Redman (1932–1936 and 1939), followed by periods with Zutty Singleton (1939–1941), Benny Carter (1940–41), and Art Hodes (1941). De Paris recorded with Jelly Roll Morton (1939) and Sidney Bechet (1940), and was part of the Panassie sessions in 1938. From 1947, and throughout the 1950s, he performed almost exclusively with his brother, Wilbur. He suffered from ill health in the latter years of his life, before he died in September 1967, at the age of 62." ;

His cover of Trans-X's \"Living on Video\" reached number one on France's singles chart. Later hits are \"Moving on Stereo\" and \"Are U Ready\". So far his music style can be best determined as Eurodance. His name is taken from 'Paquito el Chocolatero', a famous pasodoble dance from Alicante, in the Comunidad Valenciana region of Spain. His album Video was released on 8 November 2006 in the United States." ;

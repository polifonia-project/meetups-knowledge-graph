        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alicia \"Alice\" Armendariz (born November 7, 1958) is an American punk rock singer better known as Alice Bag. She is the lead vocalist and co-founder of the Bags, one of the first punk bands to form in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s. Her first book, Violence Girl: From East LA Rage to Hollywood Stage, tells the story of her childhood in East Los Angeles, her eventual move to Hollywood, and the euphoria and fallout from the first punk wave. This bilingual former elementary school teacher is still active as an author, outspoken activist, feminist, and self-described troublemaker. Bag has remained active in music since the late 1970s and released her second book in 2015. She released Alice Bag, her debut solo album on Don Giovanni Records in June 2016. A second solo album, Blueprint, was released in 2018." ;

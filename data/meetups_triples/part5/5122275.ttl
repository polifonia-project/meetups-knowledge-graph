        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bernard Lee \"Pretty\" Purdie (born June 11, 1939) is an American drummer, and an influential R&B, soul and funk musician. He is known for his precise musical time keeping and his signature use of triplets against a half-time backbeat: the \"Purdie Shuffle.\" He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2013. Purdie recorded Soul Drums (1968) as a band leader and although he went on to record Alexander's Ragtime Band, the album remained unreleased until Soul Drums was reissued on CD in 2009 with the Alexander's Ragtime Band sessions. Other solo albums include Purdie Good! (1971), Soul Is... Pretty Purdie (1972) and the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Lialeh (1973). In the mid-1990s he was a member of The 3B's, with Bross Townsend and Bob Cunningham." ;

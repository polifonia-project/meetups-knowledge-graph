        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harold Wayne King (February 16, 1901 â€“ July 16, 1985) was an American musician, songwriter, and bandleader with a long association with both NBC and CBS. He was referred to as \"the Waltz King\" because much of his most popular music involved waltzes; \"The Waltz You Saved for Me\" was his standard set-closing song in live performance and on numerous radio broadcasts at the height of his career. King's innovations included converting Carrie Jacobs-Bond's \"I Love You Truly\" from its original 24 time over to 34." ;

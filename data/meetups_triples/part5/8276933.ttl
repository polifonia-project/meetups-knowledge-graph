Jonsin has collaborated with numerous artists, including Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Usher, Lil Wayne, Kid Cudi, Eminem, Yelawolf, Nelly, T.I., Danity Kane and Jamie Foxx, among others. Jonsin won a Grammy in 2009, for Best Rap Song for Lil Wayne's \"Lollipop\". That year he was also nominated for his production on T.I.'s \"Whatever You Like\", which also garnered a nomination for Best Rap Song. Jonsin has contributed production to albums including Beyoncé's I Am... Sasha Fierce (2010 Best Contemporary R&B album), Lil Wayne's Tha Carter III (2008 Best Rap Album), Usher's Raymond v. Raymond (2011 Best Contemporary R&B album), and Usher's \"There Goes My Baby\" (2011 Best Male R&B Vocal Performance), and Eminem's Recovery (2011 Best Rap Album and Album of the Year). In 2006, Jonsin launched Rebel Rock Entertainment, his own record label imprint and subsequently signed a then unknown musician by the name of B.o.B. Jonsin then partnered with Atlantic Records, and later Grand Hustle, in a joint venture deal to work on B.o.B.'s debut album, The Adventures of Bobby Ray (2010). The album, which was executive produced by Jonsin and T.I., debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. He also signed the production duo, FnZ, and Danny Morris to his production company, Rebel Rock Productions. In addition to his ventures in music, he entered into the field of professional racing in February 2012 by forming his own motorsports team, Rebel Rock Racing. Jonsin will be driving a Porsche 911 in the upcoming Grand-am Road Racing series with co-driver D.J. Randall." ;

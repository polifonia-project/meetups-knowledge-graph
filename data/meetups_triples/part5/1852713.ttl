        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lloyd Polite Jr. (born January 3, 1986), is an American R&B singer. Born in New Orleans and raised in Decatur, he initially began his musical career as a member of the preteen-boy band N-Toon. The band disbanded in 2001 and Polite embarked on a solo career in 2003. He subsequently signed a record deal with American music executive Irv Gotti's Murder Inc. Records, under the aegis of Def Jam Recordings. In 2004, Polite released his solo debut single \"Southside\" (featuring Ashanti), the title-track from his debut album, Southside (2004). The single quickly charted on the US Billboard Hot 100, and became a top 40 hit. His second album Street Love, was released in 2007 and featured the top 20 hits \"You\" (featuring Lil Wayne) and \"Get It Shawty\". Polite's third album Lessons in Love (2008), gave the singer his second top 10 album on the Billboard 200 chart. Polite's career received an enormous boost in 2009–10, after being featured on hip hop record label Young Money's hit single \"BedRock\", gaining publicity from his presence on the song’s hook. Polite would go on to release Like Me: The Young Goldie EP in 2009. In March 2010, Polite signed to Interscope and Zone 4. His fourth album King of Hearts, was released by the aforementioned labels in 2011. The lead single, \"Lay It Down\", became a top 10 hit on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. In 2016, Polite released \"Tru\", his first single in five years, and an EP of the same name, later that year. In August 2018, he released his fifth studio album Tru LP, which included the single \"Caramel\". The remix of the song, released in February 2019 via an official music video, features female rap group City Girls. In March 2019, Polite joined an all-star lineup of early-2000s artists for The Millennium Tour, which quickly became one of the year's most popular shows. Polite had a television acting role in 2005 on the UPN show One on One, playing the role of A-Train, boyfriend to main cast member Spirit (played by Sicily). In 2019, he debuted his film acting skills as Gregory Williams, founding member of Switch, in TV One's original biopic, The Bobby Debarge Story." ;

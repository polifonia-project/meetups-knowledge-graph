        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jerry Leon Wallace (December 15, 1928 â€“ May 5, 2008) was an American country and pop singer. Between 1958 and 1964, Wallace charted nine hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including the No. 8 \"Primrose Lane\" that was later used as the theme song for the television series The Smith Family. He made his debut on the country music charts in 1965, entering it thirty-five times between then and 1980. In that timespan, Wallace charted within the country Top Ten four times. His only number one song was \"If You Leave Me Tonight I'll Cry,\" a song which gained popularity after it was used in an episode of the 1970s TV series Night Gallery." ;

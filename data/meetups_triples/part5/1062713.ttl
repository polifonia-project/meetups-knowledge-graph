        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Davies (born 22 July 1944) is an English musician, singer and songwriter best known as founder, vocalist and keyboardist of the rock band Supertramp. Davies is its only consistent member, and composed some of the band's best known songs, including \"Rudy\", \"Bloody Well Right\", \"Crime of the Century\" , \"From Now On\", \"Ain't Nobody But Me\", \"Gone Hollywood\", \"Goodbye Stranger\", \"Just Another Nervous Wreck\", \"Cannonball\", and \"I'm Beggin' You\". He is generally noted for his rhythmic blues piano solos and jazz-tinged progressive rock compositions and cynical lyrics. Starting with the self-titled Supertramp in 1970, Davies shared lead vocals with Supertramp songwriting partner, Roger Hodgson until the latter's departure in 1983, at which point he became the sole lead vocalist of the group. Davies's voice is deeper than Hodgson's, and he usually employs a raspy baritone which stands in stark contrast to his bandmate's tenor. However, he occasionally sings in a falsetto which superficially resembles Hodgson's vocals, such as on \"Goodbye Stranger\" and \"My Kind of Lady\"." ;

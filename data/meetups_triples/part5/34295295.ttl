Jockie began his musical career while a junior high school student in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan. After working with bands in Jakarta and Surabaya, in 1973, he joined with Ahmad Albar, Donny Fattah and Ludwig Leeman to form God Bless; he would remain with this band intermittently until the 2000s. Jockie also worked with artists such as Chrisye and Iwan Fals, ultimately writing two songs—\"Kehidupan\" (\"Life\") and \"Kesaksian\" (\"Witness\")—that were listed by Rolling Stone Indonesia as among the best Indonesian songs of all time." ;

He is famous for being a member of a trio, along with Juan Atkins and Derrick May, who came to be known as The Belleville Three, who is often credited to being among the pioneers and originators of techno: in particular this act helped define Detroit techno, the earliest style of this music genre. Born in New York, at the age of nine he moved to Belleville, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, where at Belleville High School he befriended the other members of the trio." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Tae-min (born July 18, 1993), better known mononymously as Taemin, is a South Korean singer, actor and dancer. He debuted as a member of the boy band Shinee in May 2008 and the supergroup SuperM in 2019, both under SM Entertainment, and has subsequently been labeled by media outlets as the \"Idol's Idol\" due to the large number of idols citing him as an inspiration. As an actor, Taemin's first role was as Junsu in the 2009 MBC comedy Tae-Hee, Hye-Kyo, Ji-Hyun. Taemin debuted as a soloist in 2014 with the release of his first extended play (EP), Ace. It peaked at number one on the South Korean Gaon Album Chart, and its lead single \"Danger\" reached number five on the Gaon Digital Chart. His first studio album, Press It (2016), also charted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart. Taemin made his solo debut in Japan in July 2016 with the release of his second EP, Sayonara Hitori. In 2017, Taemin released his second Korean studio album, Move, and the title track gained attention for its distinctive choreography. In 2018, Taemin released his first Japanese studio album, Taemin, and embarked on his first Japanese tour, named Sirius. His third Korean studio album, Never Gonna Dance Again (2020), led by singles \"Criminal\" and \"Idea\", was widely recognized by critics as one of the best K-pop releases of the year." ;

Turd released two records: Turd Up the Volume and Turdville U.S.A. Garric and Jon Morris from Turd both played in Gene Loves Jezebel for a very short time. With L.A. Guns, he was the touring bassist during part of the time Jizzy Pearl was the band's singer, and replaced touring bassist Stefan Adika, and was himself reportedly fired due to the return of the original lineup. Garric toured with Dio in 1999â€“2000 in support of the Magica record. He also co-wrote the song \"Death by Love\", which appeared on the Dio record Master of the Moon. Garric has been with Alice Cooper since 2003. He has played on the Eyes of Alice Cooper record and Dirty Diamonds record.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jay Mayo \"Ink\" Williams (September 25, 1894 â€“ January 2, 1980) was a pioneering African-American producer of recorded blues music. Some historians have claimed that Ink Williams earned his nickname by his ability to get the signatures of talented African-American musicians on recording contracts, but in fact it was a racial sobriquet from his football days, when he was a rare Black player on white college and professional teams. He was the most successful \"race records\" producer of his time, breaking all previous records for sales in this genre." ;

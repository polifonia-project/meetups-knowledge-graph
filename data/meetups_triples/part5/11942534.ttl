        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gerry Cott (born 15 October 1954, in Dublin, Ireland) is an Irish guitarist and songwriter, who was a co-founder of the Irish new wave band The Boomtown Rats. He started playing flamenco guitar when he was 11 years old. In 1966 he saw Bob Dylan performing live in Dublin and the experience influenced him radically. Gerry left The Boomtown Rats in 1982, prior to the recording of the band's fifth album V Deep. In 1984 he released the five-song album I Left My Hat in Haiti that included the single \"Alphabet Town\". \"Alphabet Town\" hit the Canadian charts, peaking at #90 during a 9-week run near the end of 1984. He is now an animal trainer and animal action supervisor in films and television with his company A-Z Animals, which followed on from a hobby and lifelong interest in animals and he is currently writing his first book. In 2010 Gerry Cott released a solo acoustic guitar album Urban Soundscapes On 20 September 2011, Gerry Cott performed live on stage with Bob Geldof at the Cadogan Hall in Sloane Square, London for the last three songs of the set. According to Geldof, it was the first time the two had been on the stage together in over 30 years." ;

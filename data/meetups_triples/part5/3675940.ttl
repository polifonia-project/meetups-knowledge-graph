        mtp:hasAbstract        "Innocent Ujah Idibia MON (born 18 September 1975), known by his stage name 2Baba, is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur and philanthropist. Noted for his vocal range, lyrical depth, and longevity, he is widely regarded as one of Nigeria's greatest musicians of all-time. He is most influential for the rise in popularity of Nigerian pop music in the 2000s, and his solo debut album Face2Face (with the smash hit \"African Queen\") ushered in a new wave of awareness and reverence for Nigerian music amongst Africans on the continent and in diaspora. Prior to July 2014, he went by the stage name 2face Idibia. 2Baba is the first winner of MTV EMA Best African Act category in 2005, and is one of the most awarded Nigerian musicians in history. In 2019, 2baba, in collaboration with other well known artistes like Cohbams Asuquo and Timi Dakolo, released a song for awareness of the rights of children. He was part of a boys group called Plantashun Boiz, under God father production.[1]" ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Patty Loveless (born Patricia Lee Ramey, January 4, 1957) is an American country music singer. She began performing in her teenaged years before signing her first recording contract with MCA Records' Nashville division in 1985. While her first few releases were unsuccessful, she broke through by decade's end with a cover of George Jones' \"If My Heart Had Windows\". Loveless issued five albums on MCA before moving to Epic Records in 1993, where she released nine more albums. Four of her albums —Honky Tonk Angel, Only What I Feel, When Fallen Angels Fly, and The Trouble with the Truth — are certified platinum in the United States. Loveless has charted 44 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including five which reached number one: \"Timber, I'm Falling in Love\", \"Chains\", \"Blame It on Your Heart\", \"You Can Feel Bad\", and \"Lonely Too Long\". Loveless' music is defined by a mix of sounds, including neotraditional country, country pop, and bluegrass music, with her singing voice garnering favorable comparisons to Loretta Lynn and Emmylou Harris. Recurring songwriters whose work she has recorded include Matraca Berg, Kostas, Jim Lauderdale, and Steve Earle. She has collaborated with Vince Gill, George Jones, and Dwight Yoakam, among others. Nearly all of her albums were produced by her husband, Emory Gordy Jr. Although she largely retired from performing in 2009, Loveless has sporadically contributed to other artists' works in subsequent years. She has won five awards from the Country Music Association, two from the Academy of Country Music, and two Grammy Awards." ;

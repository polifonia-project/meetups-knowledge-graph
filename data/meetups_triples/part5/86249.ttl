        mtp:hasAbstract        "Douglas Glenn Colvin (September 18, 1951 â€“ June 5, 2002), better known by his stage name Dee Dee Ramone, was an American musician. He was best known for being a founding member and bassist of the punk rock band Ramones. Throughout the band's existence, he was the band's most prolific lyricist and composer, writing many of their best-known songs, such as \"53rd & 3rd\", \"Chinese Rock\", \"Commando\", \"Wart Hog\", \"Rockaway Beach\", \"Poison Heart\" and \"Bonzo Goes To Bitburg\" (also known as \"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down\"). The latter won the New York Music Award for best independent single of the year in 1986, while Animal Boy, which the song is from, won for best album. Dee Dee was the band's lead vocalist until original drummer Joey Ramone took over lead vocalist duties. He was then the band's bassist and songwriter from 1974 until 1989, when he left to pursue a short-lived career in hip hop music under the name Dee Dee King. He soon returned to his punk roots and released three solo albums featuring brand-new songs, many of which were later recorded by the Ramones. He toured the world playing his new songs, Ramones songs and some old favorites in small clubs, and continued to write songs for the Ramones until 1996, when the band retired. Dee Dee was addicted to drugs, particularly heroin, for much of his life. He began using drugs as a teenager and continued to use for the majority of his adult life. He died from a heroin overdose on June 5, 2002, at the age of 50." ;

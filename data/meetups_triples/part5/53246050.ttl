She was described as \"Australia's original rock chick\" for her role in the Brisbane-based bands Railroad Gin (1973–75) and Carol Lloyd Band, as well as her solo career. She was recognised for her long, curly red hair, which was insured with Lloyd's of London for $100,000. Carol Ann Lloyd died on 13 February 2017 due to complications from her interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diagnosed four years earlier." ;

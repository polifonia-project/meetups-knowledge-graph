        mtp:hasAbstract        "Laura Nyro (/ˈnɪəroʊ/ NEER-oh; born Laura Nigro; October 18, 1947 – April 8, 1997) was an American songwriter, singer, and pianist. She achieved critical acclaim with her own recordings, particularly the albums Eli and the Thirteenth Confession (1968) and New York Tendaberry (1969), and had commercial success with artists such as Barbra Streisand and the 5th Dimension recording her songs. Wider recognition for her artistry was posthumous while her contemporaries such as Elton John idolized her. She was praised for her strong emotive vocal style and 3-octave mezzo-soprano vocal range. Between 1968 and 1970, a number of artists had hits with her songs: The 5th Dimension with \"Blowing Away\", \"Wedding Bell Blues\", \"Stoned Soul Picnic\", \"Sweet Blindness\", and \"Save the Country\"; Blood, Sweat & Tears and Peter, Paul and Mary with \"And When I Die\"; Three Dog Night and Maynard Ferguson with \"Eli's Comin'\"; and Barbra Streisand with \"Stoney End\", \"Time and Love\", and \"Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)\". Nyro's best-selling single was her recording of Carole King's and Gerry Goffin's \"Up on the Roof\". Nyro was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012." ;

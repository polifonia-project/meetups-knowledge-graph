        mtp:hasAbstract        "Terry Ellis (born 14 August 1943, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England), is an English record producer and manager who worked with the early Jethro Tull band, and as co-founder of music company Chrysalis Records in 1969. Ellis was born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, in 1943. He graduated from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne with an honours degree in mathematics and metallurgy. He began booking concerts at colleges on a part-time basis in 1966, and in 1967 he got into business with Chris Wright, forming the Ellis-Wright Agency. The act that brought them attention was Reparata and the Delrons whose record in the UK, \"Captain of Your Ship\" was climbing the charts. Ellis brought the group to England for two successful tours in 1968. For many years, he kept their file open, deeming it good luck. In 1968 they also expanded their activities to include artist management with Ellis managing Clouds and Jethro Tull, and Chris managing Ten Years After and Procol Harum. He co-produced several Jethro Tull records: This Was (1968), Stand Up (1969), Benefit (1970) and Aqualung (1971). After buying out Ellis in 1985, Wright sold the Chrysalis Records label to EMI in 1991, and finally sold the entire operation to a consortium consisting of BMG and private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2010." ;

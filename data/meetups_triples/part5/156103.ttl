She is known for playing Miranda Sanchez in Lizzie McGuire, Abby Ramirez in You Wish!, and Kate in the 1999 remake of Annie. After appearing in the roles of Young Cosette and Éponine in a Broadway musical production of Les Misérables as a child, Lalaine pursued a career in music. She signed with Warner Bros. Records following the end of Lizzie McGuire and released one studio album and one extended play, both of which saw little commercial success." ;

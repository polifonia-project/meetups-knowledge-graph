        mtp:hasAbstract        "Petrus Wandrey (8 March 1939 – 11 May 2012) was a German artist who lived and worked in Hamburg. Wandrey studied at Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg (fashion school located at Armgartstraße), from 1960 to 1963, and from 1963 to 1968 at Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg. He was influenced by Surrealism, Pop Art and the Dada movement. Wandrey was fascinated by science and technology. These subjects frequently appear in his work, influenced by the simplicity and brilliance of digital image culture. He proclaimed the Digitalist Movement with the delivery of his panel Science and Beyond at Fordham University, New York, in 1978. The work integrates vertical and horizontal pixel sequences, the smallest square-shaped units displayed on the monitor screen. Pixels create a characteristic silhouette with typically jagged outlines that become one of the trademarks of Wandrey's multi-faceted and highly diverse palette of visual imagery. Another distinctive characteristic in many of his works is his use of computer junk or individually manufactured hardware as elements in the creative process." ;

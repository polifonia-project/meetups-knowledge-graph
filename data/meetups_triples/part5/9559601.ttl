        mtp:hasAbstract        "Fereydoun Farrokhzad (Persian: فریدون فرخ‌زاد) (7 October 1938 – 3 August 1992) was a singer, actor, poet, TV and radio host, writer, humanitarian, and political opposition figure. He is best known for his variety TV show \"Mikhak-e Noghrei\" (The Silver Carnation) which introduced many artists such as Ebi, Leila Forouhar, Shohreh, Sattar and many more. He was the brother of the acclaimed Persian poets Forough Farrokhzad and Pooran Farrokhzad. Farrokhzad was forced into exile after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. After relocating to Germany, he was the victim of a murder widely believed to be set up by the Islamic Republic government as part of the chain murders." ;

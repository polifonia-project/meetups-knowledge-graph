        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hubert Neal McGaughey Jr. (born July 30, 1958), known professionally as Neal McCoy, is an American country music singer. He has released 10 studio albums on various labels, and has released 34 singles to country radio. Although he first charted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in 1988, he did not reach the top 40 for the first time until 1992's \"Where Forever Begins\", which peaked at number 40. McCoy broke through two years later with the back-to-back number one singles \"No Doubt About It\" and \"Wink\" from his platinum-certified album No Doubt About It. Although he has not topped the country charts since, his commercial success continued into the mid to late 1990s with two more platinum albums and a gold album, as well as six more top 10 hits. A ninth top 10 hit, the number 10 \"Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On\", came in 2005 from his self-released That's Life." ;

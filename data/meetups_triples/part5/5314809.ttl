        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marvin Earl Johnson (October 15, 1938 â€“ May 16, 1993) was an American R&B singer, songwriter and pianist. He was influential in the development of the Motown style of music, primarily for the song \"Come to Me,\" which was the first record issued by Tamla Records, the precursor to the famous label. Despite his early success in the United States, Johnson ultimately enjoyed more popularity overseas than in his native country. His music was especially popular in the United Kingdom and Australia." ;

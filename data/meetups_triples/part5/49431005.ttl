She was a senior officer in the Cultural Division of the Dominican Government for more than three decades, until 2015. Much of her work has been devoted to exploring the use of Caribbean folk culture as a source for creative expression. She is a niece of L. M. Christian (1913â€“2000), composer of Dominica's national anthem \"Isle of Beauty, Isle of Splendour\"." ;

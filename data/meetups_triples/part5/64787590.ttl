She studied in Vienna between 1891 and 1893 with Josef Maxinchak and Augustus Düsberg. From 1893 to 1897, she was taught by Julius Blankensee in Nuremberg where her family moved after her mother married her second husband August Göllerich. Between 1897 and 1899, she attended the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt with Ivan Knorr and Fritz Bassermann teaching her in music theory and violin. In 1899, she moved to Berlin and continued her studies with Joseph Joachim and Andreas Moser at the Königliche Hochschule für Musik. In 1903, she settled in Linz, where she was immediately awarded a gold medal at the First Upper Austrian Music Festival. She taught at the music school headed by her stepfather Göllerich. From 1908 to 1914, she lived and worked in Leipzig. In 1914, she began teaching in Berlin at the Ochs-Eichelberg Conservatory. In 1916, she moved to Munich, then from 1923 to 1925, she worked again in Linz as professor of music school and concertmaster of the local orchestra. In 1925, she returned to Munich. She performed as a soloist with a repertoire ranging from J. S. Bach and J. von Bieber to Joseph Joachim.

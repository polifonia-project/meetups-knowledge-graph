        mtp:hasAbstract        "Wilt \"Tallpree\" Cambridge (born 29 July 1973) is a Grenadian soca artist. He initially began performing as a reggae dancehall artist in the late 1980s and made the switch to becoming a soca artist the late 90s. His first stage name was Mr. Evilus, but by the time he began singing the popular \"Jab Jab\" â€“ infused music soca enthusiasts have come to expect from him, he changed his name to Tallpree. In 2000, Tallpree built a massive audience in the Spicemas Grenada Carnival season with the soca song \"Grave, Jail, Hospital,\" which was named the Road March (most popular/played song) that year. Tallpree continues to perform popular soca tunes all around the world, and in 2011, he was named Grenadian Cultural Ambassador." ;

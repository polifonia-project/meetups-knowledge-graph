        mtp:hasAbstract        "Timothy \"Tim\" Harcourt Watson (born 3 June 1971) is the lead singer of Australian indie electronic band Friends of Mine and was a founding lead singer and guitarist of Australian pop-rock band Taxiride. Raised in Melbourne, Watson was involved in several original projects before forming Taxiride with Tim Wild on vocals and guitars in 1996. With Taxiride, he had a top-10 hit on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart with \"Get Set\" and a No. 1 album with Imaginate in 1999 on the related Albums Chart. The band won an ARIA award and undertook national and international tours. Their highest charting single, \"Creepin' Up Slowly\" was co-written by Watson and peaked at No. 6 in 2002 from the related album, Garage Mahal. In 2003, Watson left Taxiride, and after several ventures in songwriting and producing joined forces with DJ Jono Fernandez in late 2006. They began writing and recording in a backyard studio in Melbourne as Friends of Mine. He is also a movie reviewer on radio programme Andy Grace's Night Show." ;

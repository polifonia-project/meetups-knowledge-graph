        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yuri Fyodorovich Fayer (also seen as Faier also known as Feuer, from the word fire in Yiddish) (17 January [O.S. 5 January] 1890 â€“ 3 August 1971), was a Soviet Jewish conductor, highly notable in ballet. He was the chief ballet conductor at the Bolshoi Theatre from 1923 to 1963. Fayer's range extended from the classical repertoire (he conducted over 400 performances of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake alone) through to new ballets by composers such as Shostakovich and Prokofiev. His world premieres included two of Prokofiev's ballets: Cinderella (1945) and (posthumously) The Tale of the Stone Flower (1954). He was held in greet esteem by such dancers as Galina Ulanova and Maya Plisetskaya." ;

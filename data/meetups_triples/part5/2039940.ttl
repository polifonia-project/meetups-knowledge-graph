        mtp:hasAbstract        "LeToya Nicole Luckett (born March 11, 1981) is an American R&B singer and actress. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as a founding member of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child, one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. As a member of Destiny's Child, she achieved four US Top 10 hit singles, \"No, No, No\", \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Say My Name\" and \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\", and won two Grammy Awards. In the 2000s, she began her solo career after leaving the group and signing a record deal with Capitol Records. Her solo debut album, LeToya (2006), debuted at number-one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and was certified platinum by the RIAA, that same year. The lead single, \"Torn\", reached the Top 40 in the U.S., and set records on BET's top ten countdown show 106 & Park. Luckett was awarded Top Songwriter at the 2006 ASCAP Rhythm and Soul Awards, and was nominated for Outstanding New Artist at the 2007 NAACP Image Awards. Luckett released a second solo album, Lady Love (2009), which debuted at number-one on the U.S. Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Luckett has since become an actress. She landed a leading role in the movie Preacher's Kid. She was part of the cast of the feature films Killers and From the Rough, as well as starring on the second season of the HBO TV series Treme, and on the third season of the VH1 TV series Single Ladies. She also had a recurring role in the OWN series Greenleaf. Luckett returned to music in 2017, releasing her third studio album, Back 2 Life (2017), her first independent release, which peaked at number-four on the U.S. Independent albums chart. The album was preceded by two singlesâ€”\"Back 2 Life\" and \"Used To\". Luckett has sold over 25 million records with Destiny's Child on the group's first two albums and singles." ;

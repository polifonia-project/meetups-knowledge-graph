She rose to prominence in 1950, scoring several major R&B hits including \"Double Crossing Blues\" and \"Mistrustin' Blues\" under the moniker \"Little Esther\". In the 1960s, she achieved chart success with the country song \"Release Me\" and recorded in the pop, jazz, blues and soul genres. Phillips received a Grammy nomination for her single \"Home Is Where the Hatred Is\" in 1973 and her disco recording of \"What a Diff'rence a Day Makes\" was a major hit in 1975. She died from liver and kidney failure due to long-term drug abuse in 1984." ;

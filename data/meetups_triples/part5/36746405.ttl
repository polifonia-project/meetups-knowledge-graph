        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nadya Tolokonnikova (Russian: Надя Толоконникова, full name Nadezhda Andreevna Tolokonnikova, Russian: Надежда Андреевна Толоконникова, IPA: [nɐˈdʲeʐdə təlɐˈkonʲːɪkəvə]; born November 7, 1989) is a Russian musician, conceptual artist, and political activist. She is a founding member of the feminist group Pussy Riot, and has a history of political activism with the street art group Voina. On August 17, 2012, she was arrested for \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\" after a performance in Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and was ultimately sentenced to two years' imprisonment. On December 23, 2013, she was released early with another Pussy Riot member Maria Alyokhina under a newly passed amnesty bill dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the Russian constitution. While jailed, Tolokonnikova was recognized as a political prisoner by the Russian human rights group Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners. Amnesty International named her a prisoner of conscience due to \"the severity of the response of the Russian authorities\". On 30 December 2021, Russia's Ministry of Justice added Tolokonnikova to its list of \"foreign agents\"." ;

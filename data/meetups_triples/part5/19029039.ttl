        mtp:hasAbstract        "Shannon Rubicam (born October 11, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter who is best known for being half of the mid-to-late-1980s pop duo Boy Meets Girl. Her husband, George Merrill, was the other half of Boy Meets Girl, best known for their 1988 hit \"Waiting for a Star to Fall\". Merrill and Rubicam first met in 1975 when both were performing at a friend's wedding. The couple also wrote two hit songs for Whitney Houston, \"How Will I Know\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\", both of which hit Number 1 in the United States, among other countries, during the second half of the 1980s, just before Boy Meets Girl shot to fame. Merrill and Rubicam have one child, a daughter named Hilary, who appeared in their \"Waiting for a Star to Fall\" video as the young blonde-haired girl. They divorced in 2000 but have continued working together for various music projects. In 2011, Rubicam published her first novel, titled The Wonderground." ;

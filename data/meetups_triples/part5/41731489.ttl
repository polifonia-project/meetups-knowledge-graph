        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marina Yakhlakova (Russian: Марина Владимировна Яхлакова; born July 20, 1991) is a prizewinning Russian classical pianist. She began learning to play aged 5. After four years of private coaching with Vitaly Mishchenko she continued her professional education at the Gnessin State Musical College for gifted children and later at the Moscow Conservatory. She also completed a post-graduate course at the Barenboim-Said Akademie in Berlin. In 2011, Yakhlakova became the third person in her direct teaching line to win a competition dedicated to the namesake of Franz Liszt, after her teacher Alexander Strukov (in 1991) and his teacher, Lev Vlassenko (in 1956). In June 2015, Yakhlakova made it to the first round of the XV International Tchaikovsky Competition but was subsequently eliminated. She is one of the only two young musicians who has been chosen by Care for Talent Foundation, a non-profit organization that accompanies, protects and guides young musical talents on their way to national and international top stages to join their artist-program." ;

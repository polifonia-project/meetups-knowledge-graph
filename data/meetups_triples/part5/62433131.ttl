        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marguerite Roesgen-Champion (24 January 1894 – 30 June 1976) was a Swiss composer, pianist and harpsichordist. Roesgen-Champion studied at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève, notably with Marie Panthès. From 1926, she lived as a composer in Paris. She composed works for orchestra, harpsichord and piano, as well as chamber and choral works. As a pianist she performed several piano concertos by Mozart and Haydn. On harpsichord she performed compositions for harpsichord by Jean-Henry d'Anglebert and Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach. In 1940 Roesgen-Champion founded a concert series entitled Suites Française which was used a showcase for students of distinction from the Paris Conservatory. She also supported the Orchestre Jane Evrard (also known as the Orchestre féminin de Paris), founded by Jane Evrard, which was an all-female chamber orchestra that performed contemporary works including the premiere of Guy Ropartz' Petite Suite." ;

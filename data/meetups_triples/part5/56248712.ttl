During the course of her career, she marketed and promoted acts including The Killers, the Wu-Tang Clan, Bloc Party, Guided By Voices, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and Spiritualized, managed such artists as Echo & The Bunnymen, K-Os, and The Dears, and employed the former Smiths's bassist Andy Rourke as an A&R director at her company. She was known for tenaciously promoting emerging indie artists and being well liked by both musicians and executives." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "William Rory Gallagher (/ˈrɔːri ˈɡæləhər/ GAL-ə-hər; 2 March 1948 – 14 June 1995) was an Irish guitarist, singer, songwriter, and producer. Due to his virtuosic playing, but relative lack of fame compared to some others, he has been referred to as \"the greatest guitarist you've never heard of\", and strongly influenced other guitarists such as Brian May and Eric Clapton. Gallagher was voted as guitarist of the year by Melody Maker magazine in 1972, and listed as the 57th greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and raised in Cork, Gallagher formed the band Taste in the late 1960s and recorded solo albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s. His albums have sold over 30 million copies worldwide. His popularity and output declined in the 1980s due to changes in the music industry and ill health. Gallagher received a liver transplant in 1995, but died of complications later that year in London at the age of 47." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Doc Corbin Dart (born March 16, 1953) is an American musician and former vocalist of the 1980s Lansing, Michigan punk rock band the Crucifucks. As of the early 2000s, he is also known by his moniker 26. Dart's unorthodox vocal stylings have been described as wailing and alarming, while others have described them favorably as heartfelt and influenced by Pete Shelley of iconic UK punk group Buzzcocks. His lyrics alternate between personal themes of abandonment and depression, and an anarchist worldview." ;

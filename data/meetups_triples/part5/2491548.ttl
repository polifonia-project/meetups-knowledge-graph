        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Mark Trohman (born September 1, 1984) is an American musician, singer, and record producer. He is best known as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist of the American rock band Fall Out Boy, as well as the lead guitarist for heavy metal supergroup the Damned Things. Fall Out Boy began in 2001 as Trohman and Pete Wentz's side project from the hardcore punk scene they were involved with, and the band has scored four number one albums on the US Billboard 200, as well as numerous platinum and multi platinum singles in the US and abroad. After a three year long hiatus, Fall Out Boy announced a comeback with a new album, tour, and single in February 2013. Since then, the band has released three full-length albums, along with two EPs, a remix album, and a greatest-hits compilation." ;

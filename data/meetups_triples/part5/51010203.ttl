        mtp:hasAbstract        "Baby Constance Irene Theresia Huwae (22 November 1939 â€“ 5 June 1989) was a Dutch-born Indonesian film actress and singer. Born in Rotterdam, she had moved to Indonesia by the 1950s and taken up modelling. She entered the film industry in 1958, and gained popularity following the success of Asrama Dara (Dormitory for Girls). Over the next several years she acted in a further five films and established a girl group, the Baby Dolls. However, after she married in 1960, Huwae focused on modelling. In the 1970s she worked as a fortune teller." ;

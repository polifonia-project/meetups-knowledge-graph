        mtp:hasAbstract        "Arthur Hanlon is an American pianist, songwriter and arranger who is widely known in the Latin music realm and has had multiple hits on the Billboard charts [1] [2]. Born to Irish-American parents, he hails from Detroit, Michigan, but found his calling in Latin music and has received widespread recognition in that realm, becoming the first pianist to reach the Billboard Latin airplay charts in more than a decade and the first to have a No. 1 on Billboard's Tropical Airplay chart. Arthur’s most current work includes a series of collaborations all under the Sony label. He is an exclusive artist. In 2020 he released Piano y Mujer (Sony Music), an album and HBOMax special that features Arthur performing with five Latin stars: Natalia Jimenez, Evaluna Montaner, Kany Garcia, Nella and Goyo of Colombian group Chocquibtown. The album's singles include \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen performed alongside Evaluna Montaner. Prior to Piano y Mujer, in 2017 Arthur released \"No Tuve La Culpa\" (with Chocquibtown) whose video features Arthur playing piano on the back of a moving semi truck along with Chocquibtown through the mountains of Colombia. 2018 saw the release of \"Aura\" (Ozuna Ft. Arthur Hanlon), and the video has garnered more that 46 Million views. In 2019 Arthur released \"Si Tu Te Vas\" (with Fonseca), Balada Para Adelina and \"Como Suena El Piano\" with the Cuban hiphop group Orishas. The iconic video was filmed in Cuba and celebrates the musical cross culturalism that is so prevalent in all of Arthur’s work. His debut project with Sony was Viajero, a CD and DVD documenting his travels through eight countries—Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Mexico and Cuba. Arthur recorded at every stop an iconic Latin track from that country with the best studio musicians to be found in each and his travels were documented by a traveling film crew. Viajero mini-docs premiered on American Airlines flights and the album Viajero, the first for Arthur on Sony Music Latin, was released in mid-2016. The documentary later went on to be a Telemundo television special. Prior to Viajero, Hanlon released Encanto del Caribe, a CD and DVD of a live concert performance filmed at Puerto Rico's historic San Cristobal Castle featuring Hanlon on piano with several guest artists: Marc Anthony, Laura Pausini, Natalia Jiménez, Cheo Feliciano, Bernie Williams and Ana Isabelle (though she does not appear on both the DVD and CD but credited on both). Encanto del Caribe was also produced as a special for public television and has aired throughout the United States. The album, out on Universal Music Latin, spent five weeks on the top 10 of Billboard's Latin Pop Albums charts. The making of Encanto del Caribe marked the first time ever that filming took place in San Cristobal Castle, a federal monument." ;

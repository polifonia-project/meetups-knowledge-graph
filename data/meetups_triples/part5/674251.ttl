        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cecilia Bartoli, Cavaliere OMRI (Italian: [tʃeˈtʃiːlja ˈbartoli]; born 4 June 1966) is an Italian coloratura mezzo-soprano opera singer and recitalist. She is best known for her interpretations of the music of Bellini, Handel, Mozart, Rossini and Vivaldi, as well as for her performances of lesser-known music from the Baroque and Classical period. She is known for singing both soprano and mezzo roles. Bartoli is considered a coloratura mezzo-soprano with an unusual timbre. According to Nicholas Wroe in 2001, her voice was known for its \"fully developed sumptuousness of the lower register, the vibrancy of the middle range...the top was limpid and powerful\", and she was one of the most popular opera singers of recent years." ;

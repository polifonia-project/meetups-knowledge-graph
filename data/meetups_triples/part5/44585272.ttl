        mtp:hasAbstract        "Henry Cave Small (born February 29, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist and radio personality. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Small has been a member of four rock bands: Prism, Scrubbaloe Caine, Small Wonder, and the Gainsborough Gallery. With Prism, Small enjoyed some success in the early 1980s. His first studio album with the band was Small Change (1981). It was the band's most commercially successful studio album on the U.S. Billboard 200, being their first and only album to make the Top 100. The lead single, \"Don't Let Him Know\", co-written by Jim Vallance with Bryan Adams, became Prism's first and only Top 40 hit in the US. It went on to peak at number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1982, and stayed in the charts for just over four months. Their follow-up studio album, Beat Street (1983) however, was more of a solo album by Small than a Prism album as it features no founding members of the band and relied heavily on session musicians. After Prism broke up in 1984, Small worked with the Who's bass guitarist John Entwistle, singing all of the lead vocals on his sixth solo studio album The Rock which was released ten years after it was first recorded, in 1996. He has also worked with Eddie Money, Doug Cox, and Richie Zito. Small pursued a solo career and released his debut studio album Time in 2002. For quite some time he worked as a morning radio personality at CIFM-FM in Kamloops, British Columbia." ;

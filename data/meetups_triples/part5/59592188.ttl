        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harry Volpe (born Onofrio Volpe, April 7, 1904 – January 16, 1995) was an early jazz guitarist and pioneering music publisher. Following the introduction and popularization of the guitar in jazz in the 1920s by Eddie Lang ‒ and prior to the world's introduction to the playing of Django Reinhardt and Charlie Christian ‒ Volpe was in the vanguard of leading early virtuoso jazz guitarists whose collective style became known as plectrum guitar marked by solo and duet jazz guitar compositions, and included Carl Kress, Dick McDonough, Al Valenti, and Frank Victor. Volpe is known for his early plectrum guitar duet recordings with Frank Victor in 1936, starting a music publishing company in the 1930s, playing with Django Reinhardt in 1946 in Reinhardt's first US visit, having a Harry Volpe Epiphone guitar introduced in 1955, and having a long career writing guitar instruction books." ;

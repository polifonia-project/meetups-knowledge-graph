She released her debut studio album, Goodies in 2004, which spawned four singles: \"Goodies\" (featuring Petey Pablo), \"1, 2 Step\" (featuring Missy Elliott), \"Oh\" (featuring Ludacris) and \"And I\". \"Goodies\" topped the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the UK Singles Chart, while \"1, 2 Step\" and \"Oh\" both peaked at two on the Hot 100 and charted within the top five in the UK. The album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and garnered two nominations at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. Ciara was also featured on Missy Elliott's \"Lose Control\" and Bow Wow's \"Like You\", both of which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution, which spawned the hit singles \"Get Up\" (featuring Chamillionaire), \"Promise\", \"Like a Boy\" and \"Can't Leave 'em Alone\" (featuring 50 Cent). The album reached number one in the U.S. and was certified platinum. Ciara's third studio album, Fantasy Ride (2009) was less successful than her first two albums. However, it produced the international top-ten single \"Love Sex Magic\" (featuring Justin Timberlake), which received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The following year, Ciara released her fourth studio album Basic Instinct, which included the R&B top-five single \"Ride\" (featuring Ludacris). After Basic Instinct was met with low sales, Ciara signed a new record deal with Epic Records in 2011. Ciara's fifth studio album, Ciara (2013), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. It spawned the single \"Body Party\", which peaked within the top-ten of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Her sixth album, Jackie (2015), included the singles \"I Bet\" and \"Dance like We're Making Love\". The next year, Ciara would sign a modeling contract with IMG, become a Global Brand Ambassador for the cosmetics giant Revlon, and marry quarterback Russell Wilson. Her seventh album, Beauty Marks (2019), included the hit single \"Level Up\". Ciara would return in 2022 having signed a new record deal with Republic Records and Uptown Records, in partnership with her label, Beauty Marks Entertainment.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Terry Adams (born August 14, 1948) is an American pianist/composer and a founding member of the musical group NRBQ (New Rhythm and Blues Quintet/Quartet), known for decades of extensive touring, energetic and humorous live shows, and wide-ranging musical repertoire, including rock, blues, country, pop, and jazz. NRBQ ceased performing in 2004, leading Adams to form the Terry Adams Rock and Roll Quartet in 2007. In March 2011, Adams announced that he was changing the name of the band to NRBQ. A new NRBQ CD, Keep This Love Goin, heralded the move. Adams was born in Louisville, Kentucky, where he met fellow resident Steve Ferguson, a singer and guitarist who also became a charter member of NRBQ. His older brother, Donn Adams, has served the band in various support roles, including originally coining the NRBQ name, playing the trombone (as part of the \"Whole Wheat Horn\" section), and writing liner notes." ;

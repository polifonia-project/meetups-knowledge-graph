        mtp:hasAbstract        "Veronica Yvette Greenfield (née Bennett, formerly Spector; August 10, 1943 – January 12, 2022) was an American singer who co-founded and fronted the girl group The Ronettes. She is sometimes referred to as the original \"bad girl of rock and roll\". Ronnie formed the singing group with her older sister, Estelle Bennett, and their cousin, Nedra Talley in the late 1950s. They were signed to Phil Spector's Philles label in 1963 and he produced the majority of their recording output. The Ronettes had a string of hits in the 1960s, including \"Be My Baby\" (1963), \"Baby, I Love You\" (1963), \"(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up\" (1964), \"Do I Love You?\" (1964), and \"Walking in the Rain\" (1964). Ronnie married Phil in 1968. Following the couple's divorce in 1974, Ronnie reformed the Ronettes and began performing again. In 1980, she released her debut solo album Siren. Her career revived when she was featured on Eddie Money's song and video \"Take Me Home Tonight\" in 1986, a Billboard top five single. She went on to release the albums Unfinished Business (1987), Something's Gonna Happen (2003), Last of the Rock Stars (2006) and English Heart (2016). She also recorded one extended play, She Talks to Rainbows (1999). In 1990, Ronnie Spector published a memoir, Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, Or, My Life as a Fabulous Ronette. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Ronettes in 2007." ;

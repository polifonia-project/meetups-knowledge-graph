Beginning his career as an independent musician in 2012, he made his major debut with the release of his first major album Basin Techno in 2016. The album includes the song \"Music Video\", which became a viral hit in Japan for parodying common tropes used in music videos. That same year, he performed the song \"Pose\", which was used as the first closing theme for the anime series Pokémon: Sun & Moon. He has also written music for commercials and for other musicians." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Moniot d'Arras (fl. 1213–1239) was a French composer and poet of the trouvère tradition. He was a monk (\"Moniot\" is a diminutive for monk) of the abbey of Arras in northern France; the area was at the time a center of trouvère activity, and his contemporaries included Adam de la Halle and Colin Muset. His songs were all monophonic in the tradition of pastoral romance and courtly love; he also wrote religious songs. About fifteen of his secular songs, and two religious songs, survive; his most famous song is \"Ce fut en mai\"." ;

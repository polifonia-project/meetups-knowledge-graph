        mtp:hasAbstract        "Derek Roddy (born August 28, 1972) is an American drummer and snake breeder, originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. His ability to record entire drum tracks in one or two takes earned him the nickname \"One Take\". Derek has gained a reputation worldwide as an extreme metal drummer. Though he may be known as the second drummer of Hate Eternal, he has also played and recorded with Nile, Malevolent Creation, Divine Empire, Council of the Fallen (where he also played guitar), Today Is the Day, Traumedy and Aurora Borealis. On March 28, 2006, Roddy announced his departure from Hate Eternal. In February 2006, Roddy was briefly named as the drummer for Blotted Science, but was unable to record due to conflicting schedules. Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler had also been considered for the project. Around 2007, Roddy started an instrumental band called Serpents Rise, which almost immediately grabbed the attention of drummers around the world. Serpents Rise is often referred to by fans as having an obscure sound for their bizarre guitar parts and incorporation of various percussion instruments. In 2010 Roddy was one out of seven drummers who auditioned to replace Mike Portnoy as the drummer for Dream Theater. Since his departure from Hate Eternal in 2006, Roddy has become a featured drum clinician for several companies, including Meinl Cymbals, Vater Percussion, and Sonor Drums (later DW). He's performed at the Singapore Drum Festival, NAMM Show, Meinl Drum Festival, DrummerLive, PASIC, and at the 2008 Modern Drummer festivalâ€“a performance which has since been released in the DVD format through Hudson Music." ;

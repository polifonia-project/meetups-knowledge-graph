        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Nelson Williams (born 1962), known by the stage name D Train, is an American singer, songwriter, instrumentalist, producer and actor. He rose to fame in the early 1980s with the release of his first album “You're the One for Me” (working with songwriter/producer Hubert Eaves III initially as a duo, also called D Train), which spawned his first US Billboard Dance chart number-one hit, \"You're the One for Me\". His debut album (under the Prelude Records label) would also chart with the hits \"Keep On\" and the much covered Burt Bacharach hit \"Walk on By\". He would go on to work with Eaves producing hits on the follow-up albums Music and Something's on Your Mind before being signed to Columbia Records, producing the albums Miracles of the Heart and In Your Eyes. The two parted ways in 1988 and D Train went on to perform on his own label, releasing the album 701 Franklin Ave.." ;

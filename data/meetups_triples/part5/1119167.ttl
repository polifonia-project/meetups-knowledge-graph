He is regarded as one of the most important writers of the latter half of the twentieth century. Known for the detailed dissection of Irish life found in works such as The Barracks, The Dark and Amongst Women, he was hailed by The Observer as \"the greatest living Irish novelist\" and in its obituary The Guardian described him as \"arguably the most important Irish novelist since Samuel Beckett\"." ;

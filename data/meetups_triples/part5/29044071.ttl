        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cher Lloyd (born 28 July 1993) is an English singer. She finished fourth place in the seventh series of The X Factor in 2010. Following the seventh series finale, Lloyd was signed to Syco Music. Her debut single, \"Swagger Jagger\", was released in July 2011 and entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Lloyd's second single, \"With Ur Love\", was released in October 2011, and peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart. Her debut studio album, Sticks and Stones, had two releases: its standard edition and a US version. The album peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, while the latter version debuted at number nine in the US Billboard 200. Lloyd signed to US record label Epic Records in 2011 and achieved mainstream success in the US with the solo version of her single \"Want U Back\", which reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. She released her second studio album, Sorry I'm Late in May 2014, preceded by the lead single, \"I Wish\". The album failed to match the success of its predecessor, peaking at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the Billboard 200. After a collaboration with singer Demi Lovato, Lloyd had a two-year absence from the music industry. In July 2016, Lloyd released the single \"Activated\", which was described as a \"memo of Cher to her fans to say she is back and she is stronger than ever\". She released the singles \"None of My Business\" and \"M.I.A.\" in 2018 and 2019, respectively." ;

She serves on the board of directors of WhyHunger, a grassroots support organization founded in 1975 by her father and the current executive director Bill Ayres. She has been compared at times with Laura Nyro, Tori Amos and Alanis Morissette. Chapin's website describes her music as \"jazz tinged urban folk soul...incorporating the funk, soul and improvisation of the city\". She studied at Brown University and the Berklee College of Music. She is also the sixth cousin of country singer Mary Chapin Carpenter. In her recent years, Jen Chapin has taken up the occupational role of a high school history teacher, specializing in global history and teaching at a local Brooklyn high school." ;

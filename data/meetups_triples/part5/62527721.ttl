        mtp:hasAbstract        "Doris Gwendoline Helliwell (born 16 December 1895) was a renowned concert pianist in early Johannesburg, South Africa. She was awarded Honours in the Associate in Music examinations through Trinity College, London. In 1916, Doris married prominent violinist Francesco Ferramosca (b. Francescantonio Ferramosca, 23 August 1893, Viggiano, Italy). After Ferramosca died in 1932, she married Michele Scuto (name changed to Scuto Mitchell). After Mitchell died a few years later, she married the big-game hunter John Francois Burger. With Burger, she traveled extensively throughout Southern Africa, big-game hunting and gold prospecting. Accompanying them on their journeys was Doris' pet leopard, Spots. These expeditions are documented in various books written by Burger. As Mrs. Doris Ferramosca she won the inaugural Southern African beauty competition, held by South African Pictorial (\"The Union's National Weekly\") in 1923, which was a precursor to the official Miss South Africa pageant." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Harold Lloyd Jenkins (September 1, 1933 â€“ June 5, 1993), better known by his stage name Conway Twitty, was an American singer and songwriter. Initially a part of the 1950s rockabilly scene, Twitty was best known as a country music performer. From 1971 to 1976, Twitty received a string of Country Music Association awards for duets with Loretta Lynn. He was inducted into both the Country Music and Rockabilly Halls of Fame. Twitty was known for his frequent use of romantic and sentimental themes in his songs. Due to his following being compared to a religious revival, comedian Jerry Clower nicknamed Twitty \"The High Priest of Country Music\", the eventual title of his 33rd studio album. Twitty achieved stardom with hit songs like \"Hello Darlin'\", \"You've Never Been This Far Before\", and \"Linda on My Mind\". Twitty topped Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart 40 times in his career, a record that stood for 20 years until it was broken by George Strait, and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart once with \"It's Only Make Believe\". He wrote 11 of his Billboard Hot Country Songs top hits." ;

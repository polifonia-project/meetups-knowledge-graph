        mtp:hasAbstract        "Shyheim Dionel Franklin (born November 14, 1977) is an American rapper from New York better known simply as Shyheim. He initially gained fame as a teenager, releasing his debut album AKA the Rugged Child at the age of 16 in 1994. He has spent the majority of his career affiliated with the Wu-Tang Clan, frequently collaborating with Method Man and Ghostface Killah. As a teenager, Shyheim was considered one of hip hop's brightest prospects, being referred to as a \"Wunderkind\" and a \"prodigy\", even being admired by fellow rappers such as Jay-Z, who said he \"looked up to him\" in admiration in his autobiography Decoded. After 1996's The Lost Generation, Shyheim's career saw a string of underperforming releases over the next eighteen years, and was finally derailed due to a hit-and-run conviction. He was released from prison in early 2020." ;

She is also the mother of the singers Maria Rita and Pedro Mariano. She became nationally renowned in 1965 after singing \"Arrastão\" (composed by Edu Lobo and Vinícius de Moraes) in the first edition of TV Excelsior festival song contest and soon joined O Fino da Bossa, a television program on TV Record. She was noted for her vocalization as well as for her interpretation and performances in shows. Her recordings include \"Como Nossos Pais\" (Belchior), \"Upa Neguinho\" (E.

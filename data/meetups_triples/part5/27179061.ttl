        mtp:hasAbstract        "Michael Wayne Atha (born December 30, 1979), better known by his stage name Yelawolf, is an American rapper. Born in Alabama and raised in Tennessee, he embarked on his career independently in 2005, releasing one extended play (EP) and four mixtapes until 2010. It was not until 2010's Trunk Muzik EP that Yelawolf started to gain mainstream attention, culminating with Yelawolf signing a deal with Interscope Records. His first release on a major label was a reworking of Trunk Muzik, titled Trunk Muzik 0-60 (2010). In January 2011, Yelawolf signed a recording deal with Eminem's record label Shady Records, and released his second studio album, Radioactive in November 2011. The album debuted at number 27 on the Billboard 200. Yelawolf released a sequel to his breakthrough mixtape Trunk Muzik, titled Trunk Muzik Returns, in March 2013. His third album, Love Story, was released in April 2015. His fourth album, Trial by Fire, was released in October 2017. His fifth album, his last under Shady Records, Trunk Muzik III, was released in March 2019. His sixth studio album, Ghetto Cowboy, and first independent studio album since signing to Eminem's imprint, was released in October 2019." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Theodore Samuel Reig (November 23, 1918 – September 29, 1984) was a self-described \"jazz hustler\" who worked as a record producer, A&R man, promoter, and artist manager from the 1940s through the 1970s. As a record producer, he captured the work of dozens of legendary jazz innovators. He also influenced rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and Latin music. In 1945 Reig produced the first recordings led by legendary Jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker. \"Had he done nothing else,\" said Reig biographer Edward Berger, \"this accomplishment alone would have ensured his place in history. But he continued to document the development of the new music through his work with a whole range of seminal artists.\"" ;

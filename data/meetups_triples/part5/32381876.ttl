        mtp:hasAbstract        "Colt Prather (born December 10, 1971 in El Paso, Texas) is an American country music singer-songwriter. Prather was discovered playing with the house band at a Nashville restaurant and signed to Epic Records. His third single for the label, \"I Won't Go On and On,\" peaked at number 48 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in early 2004. The song received a favorable review from Deborah Evans Price of Billboard, who said that \"Prather is the owner of a voice that should easily separate him from the rest of the pack\" and \"success in the country format is surely forthcoming.\" By June 2004, Prather had exited the label." ;

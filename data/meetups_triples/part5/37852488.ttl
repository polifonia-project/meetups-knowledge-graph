        mtp:hasAbstract        "Johnny Fuller (April 20, 1929 â€“ May 20, 1985) was an American West Coast and electric blues singer and guitarist. Fuller showed musical diversity, performing in several musical genres including rhythm and blues, gospel and rock and roll. His distinctive singing and guitar playing appeared on a number of 1950s San Francisco Bay Area recordings, although he ceased performing regularly by the late 1970s. He worked as an auto mechanic from 1968 to 1983. His best known recording, \"Haunted House\", was later covered with some success by Jumpin' Gene Simmons. His other better known tracks were \"Crying Won't Make Me Stay\", \"All Night Long\", \"You Got Me Whistling\" and \"Johnny Ace's Last Letter.\" He is not to be confused with, nor was he related to, the American blues musician Jesse Fuller." ;

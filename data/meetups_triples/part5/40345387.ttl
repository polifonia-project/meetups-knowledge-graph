She devoted her life to the founding and support of some of Colorado's largest cultural institutions, including the Denver Art Museum, the Central City Opera, and the Denver Public Library. She had decades of experience in leadership positions, particularly in the field of art. She was also a leader of a conservation effort and a fundraiser during World War I. Anne Evans was inducted into both the Colorado Business Hall of Fame and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2016. She had her own cabin built on the Evans–Elbert Ranch, called the Anne Evans Mountain Home, near Evergreen, Colorado. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places." ;

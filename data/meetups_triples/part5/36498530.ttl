        mtp:hasAbstract        "Leif Podhajsky is an Australian graphic designer and art director, well known for his distinctive album art working with artists such as Tame Impala, Bonobo, Foals, Kylie Minogue, Of Monsters and Men, Lykke Li, Toy, The Horrors, Mount Kimbie, Kelis, London Grammar and Aurora. Podhajsky has emerged as a promising photographer, with his brooding landscape photography attracting a large following through his popular Instagram and Facebook accounts. In addition to creating album art, has also created artwork for a number of record labels around the world, such as Warp Records, Modular Recordings, Sub Pop and Sony Music, with tour posters, T-shirts and other merchandise. Podhajsky's work explores themes of connectedness, love, fear, magic, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience, and uses techniques such as pattern, recursion, balance, symmetry and repetition. By utilizing these subjects he attempts to \"coerce the viewer into a realignment with themselves and their surroundings\"." ;

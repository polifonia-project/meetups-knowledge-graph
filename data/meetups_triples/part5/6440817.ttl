Balasubramaniam, she was the youngest among the established musicians of that era, and was the youngest female awardee of the Sangita Kalanidhi award. In 1967 she was honored with the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award by the government of India. Her daughter, the late K.Srividya, was an actress in Tamil and Malayalam languages.

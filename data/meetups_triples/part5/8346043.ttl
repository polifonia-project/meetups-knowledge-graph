        mtp:hasAbstract        "Cuthbert Morton Girdlestone (17 September 1895 â€“ 10 December 1975) was a British musicologist and literary scholar. Born in Bovey Tracey, Devon, he was educated at Cambridge and the Sorbonne, and thereafter took up the chair in French in Armstrong College, later to be King's College in Newcastle in 1926, a position he held until 1960. His most famous publications are his much-reprinted study of the Mozart Piano Concertos (1939, published originally in French) and his biography of Jean-Philippe Rameau (1957)." ;

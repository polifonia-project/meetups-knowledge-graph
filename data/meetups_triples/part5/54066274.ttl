He garnered popularity as one of the housemates of the Big Brother Naija 2017 reality game show; a localised franchise of the Dutch game show. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Lagos as well as a Statistician for the Federal Government. He is a baritone, known as Baritone Bally in the show. In 2015, Balat created an Afro infused electronic bootleg remix to Rihanna's hit song FourFiveSeconds, which brought industry recognition and led to a mash-up segment on Lagos city radio station; The Beat 99.9 FM." ;

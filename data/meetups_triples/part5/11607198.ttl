        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Daniel Burnett (October 8, 1883 â€“ January 23, 1977) was an American folk musician and songwriter from Kentucky. Burnett was born near Monticello, Kentucky. Blind for most of his life, he was a full-time travelling entertainer. With fiddler Leonard Rutherford he formed a long touring partnership, and a brief recording career in which they sang a number of popular and influential sides with Burnett on banjo or guitar. Burnett has been described as \"one of the great natural songsters, a man who collected, codified, and transmitted some of our best traditional songs. Dick was also a skilful composer and folk poet of considerable skill; his \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" remains one of the most evocative country songs.\"" ;

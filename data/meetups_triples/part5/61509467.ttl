        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Ford Ogdin (born September, 1945) is a Nashville-based recording session pianist. He is best known as a member of Elvis Presley's TCB band. He performed on 20 of Presley's recordings and accompanied him on 45 live shows until Presleys' death in 1977. Ogdin's piano playing was synchronized with archival footage of Presley's vocal performance on \"Unchained Melody\" in the 2022 motion picture, Elvis directed by Baz Luhrman. Ogdin's experiences during the Presley tours have been chronicled in a four-part series of video interviews by Billy Stallings. Over a career spanning four decades as a session musician, Ogdin recorded with country artists including Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson, George Jones, The Judds, Kenny Chesney, Ray Charles, and Ronnie Milsap. In rock music, he was a member of the Marshall Tucker Band for five years (1984â€“1989) after departures of some of the original members. He also recorded and performed concerts with the alternative rock band Ween." ;

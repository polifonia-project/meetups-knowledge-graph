        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mabel Wheeler Daniels (November 27, 1878 in Swampscott, Massachusetts â€“ March 10, 1971 in Boston) was an American composer, conductor, and teacher. She attended Radcliffe College and studied with George Whitefield Chadwick before traveling to Germany for further study with Ludwig Thuille in Munich. Upon her return to the United States she became head of the music department at Simmons College, serving there until 1918. She continued working until late in her life, and was given honorary degrees by both Boston University and Tufts University. Much of her output was choral, though she wrote a handful of operettas and some orchestral and chamber works." ;

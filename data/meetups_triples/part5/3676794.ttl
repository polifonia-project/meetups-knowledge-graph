        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter Appleyard, OC (26 August 1928 – 17 July 2013) was a British–Canadian jazz vibraphonist, percussionist, and composer. He spent most of his life in the city of Toronto, where for many years he was a popular performer in nightclubs and hotels such as The Park Plaza, Stop 33, The 54th, The Chelsea Inn, and The Montreal Bistro. He also played and recorded with many of the city's orchestras and was featured on Canadian television and radio programs. He had his own very successful television show on CHCH Channel 11 that was recorded live from Albert’s Hall, ‘Peter Appleyard Presents’ that featured all the jazz greats from Blossom Dearie to Lionel Hampton. In the early 1970s he drew wide acclaim for his performances with Benny Goodman's jazz sextet with which he toured internationally. In 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of his being an \"internationally renowned vibraphonist [who] has represented the Canadian jazz community across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Australia\"." ;

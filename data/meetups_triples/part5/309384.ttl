        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nathaniel Thomas Wilson (born July 20, 1968), better known by his stage name Kool G Rap (or simply G Rap), is an American rapper from Queens, New York City. He began his career in the mid-1980s as one half of the group Kool G Rap & DJ Polo and as a member of the Juice Crew. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential and skilled MCs of all time, and a pioneer of mafioso rap/street/hardcore content and multisyllabic rhyming. On his album The Giancana Story, he stated that the \"G\" in his name stands for \"Giancana\" (after the mobster Sam Giancana), but on other occasions he has stated that it stands for \"Genius\". He has also been cited as a major influence to some of hip-hop's most critically acclaimed figures such as The Notorious B.I.G.,Nas, Eminem and Jay-Z, as well as many underground rappers." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kesha Rose Sebert (/ˈkɛʃə ˈsiːbərt/; born March 1, 1987), formerly stylized as Ke$ha, is an American singer and songwriter. In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to Kemosabe Records. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper Flo Rida's number-one single \"Right Round\". Kesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US Billboard 200 with Animal (2010) and Rainbow (2017), and the top-ten records Warrior (2012) and High Road (2020). Kesha has attained ten top-ten singles on the US Billboard Hot 100, including \"Tik Tok\", \"Blah Blah Blah\", \"Your Love Is My Drug\", \"Take It Off\", \"Blow\", \"Die Young\", \"My First Kiss\" with 3OH!3, \"We R Who We R\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"Timber\" with Pitbull. Her 2009 single \"Tik Tok\" was the best-selling digital single in history, selling over 14 million units internationally, until surpassed in 2011. Kesha's career was halted between Warrior and Rainbow due to a legal dispute with her former producer Dr. Luke, which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as Kesha v. Dr. Luke, were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims breach of contract and defamation by Kesha. As of 2013, Kesha has reportedly sold over 33 million combined tracks and ringtones in the U.S alone and over 55 million worldwide to date. She was also listed as the 26th top artist on Billboard's 2010s decade-end charts. She has received various awards and nominations, including her win for the MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act in 2010. Kesha has also co-written songs for other artists, including \"Till the World Ends\" (2011) for Britney Spears and songs for Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus, and Miranda Cosgrove." ;

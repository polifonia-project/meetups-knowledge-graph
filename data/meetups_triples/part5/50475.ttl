        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lisa Nicole Lopes (May 27, 1971 â€“ April 25, 2002), better known by her stage name Left Eye, was an American rapper and singer. She was a member of the R&B girl group TLC, alongside Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins and Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas. Besides rapping and singing backing vocals on TLC recordings, Lopes was one of the creative forces behind the group, receiving more co-writing credits than the other members. She also designed the outfits and staging for the group and contributed to the group's image, album titles, artworks, and music videos. Through her work with TLC, Lopes won four Grammy Awards. During her brief solo career, Lopes scored two US top 10 singles with \"Not Tonight\" and \"U Know What's Up\", as well as one UK number-one single with \"Never Be the Same Again\", the latter a collaboration with Melanie C of the British girl group Spice Girls. She also produced another girl group, Blaque, who scored a platinum album and two US top 10 hits. Lopes remains the only member of TLC to have released a solo album. On April 25, 2002, Lopes was killed in a car crash while on vacation and shooting a documentary about charity work in Honduras. The vehicle she was in swerved off the road. The documentary was released as The Last Days of Left Eye and aired on VH1 in May 2007." ;

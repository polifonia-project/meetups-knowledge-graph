        mtp:hasAbstract        "Pablo Moses (born Pablo Henry, 28 June 1948, Manchester, Jamaica) is a roots reggae vocalist. Moses got his start in music performing with informal school bands. He and formed a group and entered talent shows, performing under the name, \"The Canaries\". Moses released a number of records over several decades, but he is best known for his debut, 1975's , produced by Geoffrey Chung, which included \"I Man A Grasshopper\", engineered at The Black Ark by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry. His 1980 follow up, A Song, was well received by his fans and music critics. Also well received was the single \"Ready, Aim, Fire\" off his 1983 album \"In The Future\". Reviewing the 1978 I Love I Bring LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said \"a lot of these charming, moralistic reggae ditties have the lyrical and melodic simplicity of Sunday School hymnsâ€”'Be Not a Dread' could almost be a roots 'Jesus Loves the Little Children.' And whoever devised the synthesizer riffs that set off Moses's spacey singsong deserves a gold star.\"" ;

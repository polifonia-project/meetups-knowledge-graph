        mtp:hasAbstract        "Z'EV (born Stefan Joel Weisser, February 8, 1951 â€“ December 16, 2017) was an American poet, percussionist, and sound artist. After studying various world music traditions at CalArts, he began creating his own percussion sounds out of industrial materials for a variety of record labels. He is regarded as a pioneer of industrial music. Z'EV was a strong presence in the New York City downtown music scene in the 1980s and 1990s, performing with Elliott Sharp, Glenn Branca, and doing solo performances at The Kitchen, The Knitting Factory, Danceteria, and other venues where experimental music flourished. In 1983, critic Roy Sablosky wrote: \"Z'EV doesn't just break the rules, he changes them.\" Journalist Louis Morra wrote in 1983: \"Z'EV is a consummate example of contemporary performance art, as well as modern composition and theater.\" and, \"Z'EV realizes many of modernist art's ultimate goals: primitivism, improvisation, multi-media/conjunction of art forms, the artist as direct creator.\" His work with text and sound was influenced by Kabbalah, as well as African, Afro-Caribbean and Indonesian music and culture. He studied Ewe music, Balinese gamelan, and Indian tala." ;

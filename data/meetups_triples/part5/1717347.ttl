Ramlee (Puteh Ramlee), was a Malaysian actor, filmmaker, musician, and composer famous in both modern-day Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Southern Thailand. Due to his contributions to the film and music industry and his literary work, which began with his acting debut in Singapore in 1948, to the height of his career and then later in Malaysia in 1964 to his decline and death, he is regarded as a prominent icon of Malay entertainment. His popularity has reached as far as Brunei, Indonesia, as well as in Hong Kong and Japan." ;

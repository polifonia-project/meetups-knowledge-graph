Cymone was a bass guitarist for Prince's touring band, pre-Revolution. Cymone began a solo career in 1981. His song, \"The Dance Electric\" (written by Prince), reached #10 on the R&B charts in 1985. Cymone later co-wrote and produced hit songs for other acts, including his then wife Jody Watley's \"Looking for a New Love\" and \"Real Love\". Cymone's stage name comes from a variation of his middle name, Simon." ;

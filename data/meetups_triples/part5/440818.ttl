She scored a number of hits in the 1970s and achieved a US #1 hit with \"If I Can't Have You\". The song also reached #9 on the Adult Contemporary chart and number 4 in the UK Chart. Her cover of Barbara Lewis's \"Hello Stranger\" went to #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and \"Love Me\" was also #5, giving her 3 top 10 singles. After a long hiatus in the 1980s and 1990s, during which time she dedicated herself to her family, she made a comeback album as a singer-songwriter in 2004." ;

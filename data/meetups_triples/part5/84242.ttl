        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elizabeth Caroline Orton (born 14 December 1970) is an English musician, known for her \"folktronica\" sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica. She was initially recognised for her collaborations with William Orbit, Andrew Weatherall, Red Snapper and the Chemical Brothers in the mid-1990s. Her UK/US first solo album, Trailer Park, received much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the BRIT Award-winning album Central Reservation (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, Daybreaker. Her 2006 album, Comfort of Strangers, was followed by a break during which Orton gave birth to her daughter and collaborated with the British guitarist Bert Jansch. Orton returned with Sugaring Season in 2012, which moved towards a purer acoustic sound, followed by a return to electronic music with , released in 2016. Orton's music has been featured in Felicity, How to Deal, Charmed, Dawson's Creek, Roswell, Vanilla Sky, Grey's Anatomy, and Manifest, providing her with exposure to a more mainstream American audience." ;

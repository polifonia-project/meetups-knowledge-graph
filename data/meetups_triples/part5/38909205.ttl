        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donn E. Pohren (1929â€“2007) was an American guitarist and historian. He is known for his three major texts on flamenco: The Art of Flamenco (1962), Lives and Legends of Flamenco: A Biographical History (1964), and A Way of Life (1980). He is the only non-Spaniard to receive the title of flamencologist by the Catedra de Flamencologia. Hailing from Minneapolis, he moved to Seville, married the dancer Luisa Maravilla, had a daughter, and completed a university degree in Madrid. He states that \"in the beginning I used to say my mother was Spanish, and call myself Daniel Maravilla, which did help in getting accepted.\"" ;

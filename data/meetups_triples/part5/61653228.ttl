        mtp:hasAbstract        "Robert Vernon Cavin (born November 12, 1940) is an American audio engineer who built the first monitor mixing console, the first multi-angle monitor loudspeaker, and the first integrated processing/amplifier package for a 3-way loudspeaker. He was chief engineer of McCune Sound in San Francisco in the 1970s, and also vice president in the 1980s. In 1992 he accepted the chief engineer position at Apogee Sound where he designed the DA Series Class-H digitally controlled amplifier, winning the 1994 TCI Product of the Year Award. In 2000 he joined Furman Sound, and designed an interface system for Smaart users, and a new power conditioning system. Cavin's electronic designs were nominated five times for TEC Awards, in 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Duncan Mackay (born 26 July 1950) is a British composer, singer, arranger, and keyboard player who has recorded eight solo albums as well as collaborations. He was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, England. He played with Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel from 1974 to 1977 and 10cc from 1978 to 1981, and also played on Kate Bush's first three albums, The Kick Inside, Lionheart (both 1978) and Never for Ever (1980), as well as Camel's 1981 album Nude, and Budgie's 1982 album Deliver Us from Evil. In the early 1980s, he was briefly considered for the keyboard player position in Yes. In 2004, he completed an album with South African singer/composer Greg McEwan-Kocovaos, The First Time. This indie album received its first airplay on Radio Caroline by the veteran UK DJ Martin Turner and was reviewed by the official 10cc fan site. Mackay's daughter Fawn James is the granddaughter of Paul Raymond." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kirk Whalum (born July 11, 1958) is an American R&B and smooth jazz saxophonist and songwriter. He toured with Whitney Houston for more than seven years and soloed in her single \"I Will Always Love You\", the best-selling single by a female artist in music history. He was also featured on many Luther Vandross albums, most often playing on the singer's covers of older pop and R&B standards such as \"Anyone Who Had a Heart\", \"I (Who Have Nothing)\", and \"Love Won't Let Me Wait\". Whalum has recorded a series of well received solo albums and film soundtracks, with music ranging from pop to R&B to smooth jazz. His musical accomplishments have brought him a total of 12 Grammy nominations. He won his first Grammy award in 2011 for Best Gospel Song (\"It's What I Do\", featuring Lalah Hathaway) alongside lifelong friend and writer Jerry Peters." ;

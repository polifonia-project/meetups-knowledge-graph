        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kathleen Edwards (born July 11, 1978) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. Her 2002 debut album, Failer, contained the singles \"Six O'Clock News\" and \"Hockey Skates\". Her next two albums – Back to Me and Asking for Flowers – both made the Billboard 200 list and reached the top 10 of Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. In 2012, Edwards' fourth studio album, Voyageur, became Edwards' first album to crack the top 100 and top 40 in the U.S., peaking at #39 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and #2 in Canada. In 2012, Edwards' song \"A Soft Place To Land\" won the SOCAN Songwriting Prize, an annual competition that honours the best song written and released by 'emerging' songwriters over the past year, as voted by the public. Her musical sound has been compared to Suzanne Vega meets Neil Young." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Julie Grant (born 12 July 1946) is an English pop music singer, who was mainly active during the 1960s. She had three hits on the UK Singles Chart with \"Up on the Roof\", \"Count on Me\" (both 1963) and \"Come to Me\" (1964). She also recorded a cover version of \"Every Day I Have to Cry\" (1964). Grant was a contemporary of Petula Clark and Cilla Black, and Allmusic journalist, Richie Unterberger, noted \"she had a strong, versatile voice\" but was hindered by \"her inability to carve out a recognizable stylistic niche\"." ;

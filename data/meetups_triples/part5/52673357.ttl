        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jimmie Gordon (probably 1906 â€“ possible October 27, 1993) was an American Chicago blues pianist, singer, and songwriter. In the course of his career he accompanied Memphis Minnie, Bumble Bee Slim, and Big Bill Broonzy, amongst others. He had a hit with \"I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water\" (1936) and was active on the Chicago blues scene for a number of years leading up to World War II. He is known to have recorded 67 tracks between 1934 and 1946. Gordon was a mainstay of Decca Records during the 1930s and early 1940s, with his recorded work utilizing a piano accompaniment (often his own), as well as guitar, or with a small band that he assembled for the work. As a songwriter, Gordon is often credited with writing \"Mean Mistreater\", later recorded by both Muddy Waters and Johnny Winter. AllMusic noted that \"Gordon was a passable pianist who sang with all his heart in a warm and convincing voice.\" Details of his life outside the recording studio are sketchy and have been the subject of rumor and speculation over the years." ;

Other than that, his repertoire includes duets with former Yugoslav singers, including Indira Radić, Marta Savić, Jelena Karleuša and Severina. Boyanov performed \"Let Me Cry\" at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 with Mariana Popova, staying in the semi-finals. Other than his acclaimed career as a vocalist, he competed unsuccessfully in the 2005 Bulgarian parliamentary election as a member of the Euroroma party. Azis remains a prominent figure in the Bulgarian music scene." ;

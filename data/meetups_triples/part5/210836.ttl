        mtp:hasAbstract        "Johann \"Hans\" Hölzel (German: [ˈjoːhan ˈhœlt͡sl̩]; 19 February 1957 – 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name Falco, was an Austrian singer and musician. Falco had several international hits including \"Der Kommissar\" (1981), \"Rock Me Amadeus\", \"Vienna Calling\", \"Jeanny\", \"The Sound of Musik\", \"Coming Home (Jeanny Part II, One Year Later)\", and posthumously \"Out of the Dark\". \"Rock Me Amadeus\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts in 1986, making him the only artist in history whose principal language was German, to score a vocal number-one hit in the United States. According to his estate, he has sold 20 million albums and 40 million singles, which makes him the best-selling Austrian singer of all time. Also notable was his very early creation of a successful non-English language rap music song (Der Kommissar), recorded in December of 1981." ;

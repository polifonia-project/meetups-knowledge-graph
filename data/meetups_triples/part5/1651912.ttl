        mtp:hasAbstract        "Danny Wayland Seals (February 8, 1948 â€“ March 25, 2009) was an American musician. The younger brother of Seals and Crofts member Jim Seals, he first gained fame as one half of the soft rock duo England Dan & John Ford Coley, who charted nine singles between 1976 and 1980, including the No. 2 Billboard Hot 100 hit \"I'd Really Love to See You Tonight\". After the duo disbanded, Seals began a solo career, starting in soft rock before shifting to country music. Throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s, he released 16 studio albums and charted more than 20 singles on the country charts. Eleven of his singles reached number one: \"Meet Me in Montana\" (with Marie Osmond), \"Bop\" (also a No. 42 pop hit), \"Everything That Glitters (Is Not Gold)\", \"You Still Move Me\", \"I Will Be There\", \"Three Time Loser\", \"One Friend\", \"Addicted\", \"Big Wheels in the Moonlight\", \"Love on Arrival\", and \"Good Times\". Five more of his singles also reached top ten on the same chart." ;

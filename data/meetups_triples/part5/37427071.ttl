Ataklan has been referred to as \"Trinidad's answer to Beck\" and a \"fiercely independent songwriter and singer and arguably the most original artist to have emerged on the island since David Rudder\". Since his emergence in 1993, Ataklan has released tracks including \"Flambo\", \"Naked Walk\", \"Flood on the Main Road\", \"Shadow in de Dark\", \"Soca Girl\" and \"Caribbean Swagga\", among numerous others." ;

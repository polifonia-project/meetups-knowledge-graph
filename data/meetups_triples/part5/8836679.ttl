        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Moody (March 26, 1925 â€“ December 9, 2010) was an American jazz saxophone and flute player and very occasional vocalist, playing predominantly in the bebop and hard bop styles. Moody had an unexpected hit with \"Moody's Mood for Love,\" a 1952 song written by Eddie Jefferson that used as its melody an improvised solo that Moody had played on a 1949 recording of \"I'm in the Mood for Love.\" Moody adopted the song as his own, recording it with Jefferson on his 1956 album Moody's Mood for Love and performing the song regularly in concert, often singing the vocals himself." ;

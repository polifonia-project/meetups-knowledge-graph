        mtp:hasAbstract        "Leonora Duarte (1610 â€“ 1678?) was a Flemish composer and musician, born in Antwerp. She belonged to a wealthy Portuguese-Jewish family who were Converso, meaning they outwardly acted as Catholics while secretly maintaining their Jewish faith and practices. She was baptized on 28 July 1610. Having been one of the six siblings, in the well known musical family of the Duartes, Leonora composed seven sinfonias which are apparently the earliest music written for viol by a woman in the 17th century. The Duarte home was a center for music-making and had contact with many important families in the Low Countries and England, including one of the most influential Dutchman of all time in regards to art and culture, Constantijn Huygens. Duarte wrote for viol consort. Her surviving compositions include seven fantasies for a consort of five viols.[1]" ;

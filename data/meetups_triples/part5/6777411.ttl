Both his parents have a teaching background; one is from Cacouna, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec and the other from the Mediterranean coast. Ahmarani is known for his roles in the movies The Left-Hand Side of the Fridge (La Moitié gauche du frigo) and How My Mother Gave Birth to Me During Menopause (Comment ma mère accoucha de moi durant sa ménopause). He has also appeared in the first season of the television Star Trek parody Dans une galaxie près de chez vous. In 2005 he released a musical album called \"Portrait vivant\" under the name \"Paul Ahmarani et les nouveaux mariés\" (\"Paul Ahmarani and the Newlyweds\", see the External links section to listen). Outside his acting and singing career, Paul Ahmarani has also been an open supporter of Quebec's left-wing party, Québec solidaire. On 25 February 2010, Paul Ahmarani, together with 500 artists, joined the call to support the international campaign for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against the Israeli Apartheid. In 2012, audiences saw him in Martin Villeneuve's Mars et Avril, a science fiction film based on the graphic novels of the same name." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ross Matthew Birchard (born 11 February 1986), better known by the stage name Hudson Mohawke, is a Scottish-American producer, composer, and DJ from Glasgow. He is known for his influential work in 21st century hip-hop and electronic music, as well as becoming part of Internet meme culture after his song \"Cbat\" went viral on many social media platforms. A founding member of the UK label collective LuckyMe, his fractured, colorful take on hip-hop made him a leading figure in the late-2000s wonky scene. He released his debut album Butter in 2009 on Warp Records. He has followed with the solo albums Lantern (2015) and Cry Sugar (2022), both on Warp. Birchard is also one-half of the duo TNGHT with Canadian producer Lunice; their influential eponymous EP was released in 2012. That year, Birchard signed with Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music production team, contributing to the label compilation Cruel Summer (2012) and West's LP Yeezus (2013). He subsequently became an in-demand producer, working with artists such as West, Pusha T, Drake, A$AP Rocky, Lil Wayne, Anohni, and Danny L Harle." ;

The band released a pair of top 20 U.S. hit singles in 1965, \"Laugh, Laugh\" and \"Just a Little\". He later fronted another band, Stoneground, which produced three albums in the early 1970s. After reuniting on numerous occasions with the Beau Brummels, Valentino began a solo career, releasing his latest album, Every Now and Then, in 2008." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Don Arden (born Harry Levy; 4 January 1926 â€“ 21 July 2007) was an English music manager, agent, and businessman. He managed the careers of rock acts such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Air Supply, Small Faces, The Move, Black Sabbath and Electric Light Orchestra. Arden gained a reputation in Britain for his aggressive, sometimes illegal business tactics, which led to his being called \"Mr Big\", the \"English Godfather\" and the \"Al Capone of Pop\". His success story turned sour when his violent 'negotiating' methods and questionable accounting caught up with him, and he became estranged from members of his own family. He was married to Hope Shaw, a former ballet dancer/teacher, who died in 1999. He was the father of David Levy and Sharon Osbourne." ;

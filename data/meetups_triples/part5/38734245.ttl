        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexandre Magno Abrão (9 April 1970 – 6 March 2013), known professionally as Chorão, was a Brazilian singer-songwriter, skateboarder, filmmaker, screenwriter and businessman. Best known for being a founding member and the vocalist/main lyricist of the influential alternative rock band Charlie Brown Jr., Folha de S.Paulo critic André Barcinski considered him \"the nearest thing to a punk hero Brazilian mainstream music ever had\", and Eduardo Tristão Girão of Portal Uai called him \"the bad boy of Brazilian rock\" and \"the spokesman of the youth of the 1990s\". Having been born and raised for most of his childhood in São Paulo, Chorão was the only Charlie Brown Jr. member not to hail originally from Santos, and its only founding member to remain consistently in all of the group's line-ups." ;

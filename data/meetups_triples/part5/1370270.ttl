        mtp:hasAbstract        "Faron Young (February 25, 1932 â€“ December 10, 1996) was an American country music producer, musician, and songwriter from the early 1950s into the mid-1980s. Hits including \"If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')\" and \"Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young\" marked him as a honky-tonk singer in sound and personal style; and his chart-topping singles \"Hello Walls\" and \"It's Four in the Morning\" showed his versatility as a vocalist. Known as the Hillbilly Heartthrob, and following a singing cowboy film role as the Young Sheriff, Young's singles charted for more than 30 years. In failing health, he died by suicide at 64 in 1996. Young is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame." ;

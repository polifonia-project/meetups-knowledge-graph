He has starred in some of the highest-grossing films of his era, such as Jurassic Park (1993) and Independence Day (1996), as well as their sequels. After playing supporting roles in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Goldblum came to wider attention as Seth Brundle in David Cronenberg's The Fly (1986), which earned him a Saturn Award for Best Actor. He has also appeared in several TV series, including Will & Grace, for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He directed the short film Little Surprises, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.

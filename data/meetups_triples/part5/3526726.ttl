Along with a successful recording career in the 1960s, Hill hosted several hit TV shows during the seventies and eighties, including They Sold a Million (BBC), Musical Time Machine (BBC) and his own chat show Gas Street (ITV). Outside of his work in show business, Hill is a Patron of The Macular Society, a UK charity for anyone affected by central vision loss. Hill revealed in 2019 that he is losing his eye sight to Age-Related Macular Disease (AMD)." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lee Eastman (born Leopold Vail Epstein; January 12, 1910 â€“ July 30, 1991) was an American show business attorney and art collector from New York City. He was the son of Louis and Stella (Freyer) Epstein, who immigrated to the United States from Russia in 1906. One of his four children was Linda McCartney, the first wife of former Beatle Paul McCartney. Eastman became McCartney's business manager shortly before the breakup of The Beatles, while his son John Eastman represented McCartney during his 1970 lawsuit to dissolve the group legally. He is the maternal grandfather of potter Heather McCartney, photographer Mary McCartney, fashion designer Stella McCartney, and musician/sculptor James McCartney. Eastman was also the friend and longtime lawyer for and collector of the works of the abstract expressionist painter Willem de Kooning. His sister Rose Frisch became a noted scientist who worked on issues of women's fertility and population studies. His family was Jewish." ;

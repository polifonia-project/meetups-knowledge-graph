        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nigel David Rogers (21 March 1935 â€“ 19 January 2022) was an English multilingual tenor, music conductor, and vocal coach, who sang in over seventy classical music album recordings in German, French, Italian, Latin and English, mostly of early music, baroque and sacred music, including works by Claudio Monteverdi, Handel, Purcell, and Bach. Singing critics like Melanie Eskenazi describe him as a vocal virtuoso of the local phrasing and decoration (ornamenti) of those particular musical periods exactly as they were practised back then. He was considered a world authority in the field of European early music, the scores of which he helped promote and rescue as a music genre, since the outset of his early career." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donald B. Jenkins (born November 5, 1977), better known as Dizzle and Baby D, is an underground rapper from Atlanta. His first album, Off Da Chain, was released in 2000 on Big Oomp Records. Two years later his follow up, Lil' Chopper Toy was released. A major label bidding war ensued, garnering the young MC a multimillion-dollar deal with Epic Records. He was signed with Koch Records, and released his first mainstream album, A-Town Secret Weapon, on April 29, 2008. Three years later, in 2011, Baby D signed with Mizay Entertainment. In March 2012, Baby D changed his stage name to Dizzle. On November 1, 2012, he released his third independent album entitled About My Grind. He also created his own label, AMG, or Alliance Music Group." ;

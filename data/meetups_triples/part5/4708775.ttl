        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roy Theodore Hawkins (February 7, 1903 â€“ March 19, 1974) was an American blues singer, pianist, and songwriter. After working in clubs, he broke through with his 1950 song \"Why Do Things Happen to Me\" inspired by an auto accident which paralyzed his right arm. Several of his songs, most notably \"The Thrill Is Gone\", were covered by later artists, including Ray Charles, B.B. King, and James Brown." ;

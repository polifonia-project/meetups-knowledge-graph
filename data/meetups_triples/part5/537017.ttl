        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jack Hylton (born John Greenhalgh Hilton; 2 July 1892 â€“ 29 January 1965) was an English pianist, composer, band leader and impresario. Hylton rose to prominence during the British dance band era, being referred as the \"British King of Jazz\" and \"The Ambassador of British Dance Music\" by the musical press, not only because of his popularity which extended throughout the world, but also for his use of unusually large ensembles for the time and his polished arrangements. He mostly retired from the music industry after 1940, becoming a successful theatrical businessman until his death." ;

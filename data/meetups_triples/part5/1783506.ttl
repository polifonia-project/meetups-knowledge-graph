        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marilyn Crispell (born March 30, 1947) is an American jazz pianist and composer. Scott Yanow described her as \"a powerful player... who has her own way of using space... She is near the top of her field.\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote: \"Hearing Marilyn Crispell play solo piano is like monitoring an active volcano... She is one of a very few pianists who rise to the challenge of free jazz.\" In addition to her own extensive work as a soloist or bandleader, Crispell is also known as a longtime member of saxophonist Anthony Braxton's quartet in the 1980s and '90s." ;

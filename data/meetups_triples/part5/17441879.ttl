        mtp:hasAbstract        "John McKay is an English songwriter and guitarist. He was the first studio guitarist of Siouxsie and the Banshees. He was a member of the group from July 1977 until September 1979. He played a \"jagged unorthodox chording\", and created a \"metal-shard roar\" with his guitar. Q magazine included McKay's work on \"Hong Kong Garden\" in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever\". He recorded two studio albums with the band, their debut album The Scream in 1978 and the sophomore album Join Hands in 1979. McKay has been cited as an influence by guitarists such as Geordie Walker of Killing Joke, Robert Smith of the Cure, the Edge of U2, Steve Albini of Big Black, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Jim Reid of the Jesus and Mary Chain, Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine and Boz Boorer. Record producer Steve Lillywhite stated that McKay was the innovator." ;

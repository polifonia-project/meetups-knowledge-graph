        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian Dougans (born 1968) is a British musician, and a member of the British electronic duo, the Future Sound of London (FSOL). He is the more technical member of FSOL, doing most of the programming, circuit bending et cetera and creating electronic instruments at his home studio in Glastonbury, Somerset. He is currently head of FSOLdigital (FSOL's record label) and co designer of the FSOL:Digitana SX-1 Synthesiser. Dougans' first releases were as \"Humanoid\", releasing the acid house single \"Stakker Humanoid\", which reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart in 1988, and also charted in 1992 and 2001. \"Stakker Humanoid\" was No.1 for five weeks in the UK Dance Chart (December 1988) and has been cited as a major influence on early Aphex Twin releases. Dougans music as Humanoid is also part of the MOMA NY collection via Stakker Eurotechno. Dougans has always been the quiet, technical workhorse of FSOL whilst Garry Cobain brings in his melody and softness to balance Dougans' technical wizardry." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mark Sandman (September 24, 1952 â€“ July 3, 1999) was an American singer, songwriter, musical instrument inventor, multi-instrumentalist and comic writer. Sandman possessed a distinctive, deep bass-baritone voice and a mysterious demeanour. He was an indie rock icon and longtime fixture in the Boston/Cambridge music scene, best known as the lead singer and slide bass player of the band Morphine. Sandman was also a member of the blues-rock band Treat Her Right and founder of Hi-n-Dry, a recording studio and independent record label. On July 3, 1999, he suffered a heart attack during a concert in Italy and died instantly. He was highly regarded by many other bass players for his unique \"slow and murky\" style, with Les Claypool, Mike Watt, and Josh Homme all citing Sandman as an influence." ;

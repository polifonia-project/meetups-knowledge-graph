        mtp:hasAbstract        "Willie Mae Thornton (December 11, 1926 â€“ July 25, 1984), better known as Big Mama Thornton, was an American singer and songwriter of the blues and R&B genres. She was the first to record Leiber and Stoller's \"Hound Dog\", in 1952, which became her biggest hit, staying seven weeks at number one on the Billboard R&B chart in 1953 and selling almost two million copies. Thornton's other recordings included the original version of \"Ball and Chain\", which she wrote. Her recording of \"Hound Dog\", written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller in 1952, and later recorded by Elvis Presley, reached Number 1 on the Rhythm & Blues Records chart. According to Maureen Mahon, a music professor at New York University, \"the song is seen as an important beginning of rock-and-roll, especially in its use of the guitar as the key instrument\"." ;

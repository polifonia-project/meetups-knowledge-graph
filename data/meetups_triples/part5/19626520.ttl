        mtp:hasAbstract        "Elias Petropoulos (Greek: Ηλίας Πετρόπουλος; Athens June 26, 1928 - Paris September 3, 2003) was a Greek author, folklorist and urban historian. A self-described \"urban anthropologist,\" he wrote on aspects of Greek life that were rarely considered objects of serious study, including the subcultures, slangs, and music of homosexuals, drug users, and criminals. Some of his books were regarded as immoral during the rule of the Greek military junta of 1967–74, resulting in fines and jail terms and ultimately in his decision to leave Greece to live permanently in France." ;

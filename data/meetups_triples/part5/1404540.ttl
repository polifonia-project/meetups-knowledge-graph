        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lilyan Tashman (October 23, 1896 â€“ March 21, 1934) was an American actress. Tashman was best known for her supporting roles as tongue-in-cheek villainesses or playing the vindictive \"other woman\". She made 66 films over the course of her Hollywood career, and although she never obtained superstar status, her cinematic performances are described as \"sharp, clever and have aged little over the decades.\" Tall, blonde, and slender with fox-like features and a throaty voice, Tashman freelanced as a fashion and artist's model in New York City. By 1914, she was an experienced vaudevillian, appearing in Ziegfeld Follies between 1916 and 1918. In 1921 Tashman made her film debut in Experience, and over the next decade and a half she appeared in numerous silent films. With her husky contralto singing voice she easily navigated the transition to sound film. Tashman married vaudevillian Al Lee in 1914, but they divorced in 1921. She married actor Edmund Lowe in 1925, and her wardrobe and lavish parties became the talk of the town. She died of cancer in New York City on March 21, 1934, at the age of 37. Her last film, Frankie and Johnny, was released posthumously in 1936." ;

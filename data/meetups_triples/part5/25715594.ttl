        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tale Ognenovski (Macedonian: Тале Огненовски; April 27, 1922 – June 19, 2012) was a Macedonian multi-instrumentalist who played clarinet, recorder, tin whistle, bagpipe, zurna, and drums. He composed or arranged 300 instrumental compositions: Macedonian folk dances, jazz compositions, and classical concerts. On January 27, 1956, he performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City as a clarinet and reed pipe (recorder) soloist of the Macedonian State Ensemble of Folk Dances and Songs. For this Carnegie Hall concert The New York Times music critic John Martin, wrote two articles: \"Ballet: Yugoslav Folk Art; 'Tanec' Dancers Appear at Carnegie Hall in Display of Tremendous Skill\" \", published on January 28, 1956, and \"The Dance: Folk Art; Group From Yugoslavia In Impressive Debut Learning vs. Magic No Macedonian Monopoly The Week's Events\", published on February 5, 1956. Dance Observer commented, \"The capacity audience at Carnegie Hall on January 27 for the single New York performance of Tanec, the Yugoslav National Folk Ballet, enjoyed a fascinating cross-section of over 2000 years of human history and culture. Tanec is a Macedonian group.\" Life commented, \"This spring, the Yugoslav National Folk Ballet is making a first, and highly successful tour of the U.S...Together they make as vigorous a display of dancing as the U.S. has ever seen.\" Craig Harris at Allmusic noted for Macedonian National Ensemble for Folk Dances and Songs \"Tanec\" and clarinetist Tale Ognenovski, \"The ensemble reached their peak during the late '50s, when influential clarinet and pipes player Tale Ognenovski was a member.\" All About Jazz celebrated April 27, 2009, the birthday of Tale Ognenovski with All About Jazz recognition: Jazz Musician of the Day: Tale Ognenovski, with announcement published at his website. Tale Ognenovski won top honors on October 11, 2003 at Macedonian Parliament as the Winner of \"11 October\" Award, the highest and the most prestigious national award in Republic of Macedonia. Ognenovski was included in the book The Greatest Clarinet Players of All Time: Top 100 by Alex Trost and Vadim Kravetsky. Tale Ognenovski and his son Stevan Ognenovski arranged for two clarinets Clarinet Concerto in A Major, K.622, composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and recorded the albums Mozart and Ognenovski Clarinet Concertos and Mozart Clarinet Concerto in A, K. 622 Arranged for Two Clarinets by Tale Ognenovski . Perhaps these two albums are unique recordings of this concert with two clarinets where first clarinet with first arrangement and second clarinet with second arrangement that's played simultaneously – by one performer (Tale Ognenovski).

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jade Williams (born 21 May 1988 in Sidcup, Greater London, England, UK) professionally known as Whinnie Williams is a British independent pop singer, interior designer & presenter. She founded interiors brand Poodle & Blonde in 2018 and is host for BBC 3 show Flat Out Fabulous since 2020. Williams grew up in Broxbourne. During her early teenage years, Williams was employed at a local pet shop where she worked every Sunday. Having not revealed her name to the other members of staff, Williams became known as Sunday Girl, which would later become her music alias. Growing up, Williams was always shy when it came to performing and singing in front of people, so her mother took her to see a hypnotist when she was 17, and it helped her to overcome the fear. With her fear of performing gone, Williams joined many cover bands including a ska band, a jazz band, and a trio who did covers of '40s blues standards with a ukulele and double bass. Williams completed an Art Foundations course at University and studied set design at Wimbledon College of Art, but took a gap year during her studies to travel and, more importantly, focus on songwriting, as she was getting bored with only singing covers of other artists songs. During the gap year, she was discovered by a manager one night while singing in a night club, and he helped direct her to work with other songwriters, which led to her eventual signing with Polydor Records and Universal's Geffen Records in late 2009." ;

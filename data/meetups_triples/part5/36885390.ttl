Born and raised in Los Angeles, she is the older sister of R&B singer Jhéne Aiko and is known for being in Prince's video for \"Diamonds and Pearls\" and appearing on tracks by RaRa, IMx, Trey Songz and Omarion. She released several singles in 2006–2009 under the name \"Mila J\" and then went on a hiatus for a number of years after the shelving of her original debut studio album, Split Personality, before returning as \"Japallonia\" in 2012 and then reverting to Mila J a year later. She was signed to Motown from 2013 to 2017 and released two EPs, Made in L.A. (2014) and 213 (2016) while signed to them. In 2017, she released her official debut album, Dopamine.

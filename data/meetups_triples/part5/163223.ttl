        mtp:hasAbstract        "Mathis James Reed (September 6, 1925 â€“ August 29, 1976) was an American blues musician and songwriter. His particular style of electric blues was popular with blues as well as non-blues audiences. Reed's songs such as \"Honest I Do\" (1957), \"Baby What You Want Me to Do\" (1960), \"Big Boss Man\" (1961), and \"Bright Lights, Big City\" (1961) appeared on both Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues and Hot 100 singles charts. Reed influenced other musicians, such as Elvis Presley, Hank Williams Jr., and the Rolling Stones, who recorded his songs. Music critic Cub Koda describes him as \"perhaps the most influential bluesman of all,\" due to his easily accessible style." ;

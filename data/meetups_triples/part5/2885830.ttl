        mtp:hasAbstract        "Narayan Shripad Rajhans, popularly known as Bal Gandharva, (26 June 1888 â€“ 15 July 1967) was a famous Marathi singer and a stage actor. He was known for his roles in female characters in Marathi plays, since women were not allowed to act on stage during his time. Bal Gandharva got his name after a singing performance in Pune. Lokmanya Tilak, a social reformer and a freedom fighter of Indian independence movement was in the audience, and after the performance, reportedly patted Rajhans on the back and said that Narayan was a \"Bal Gandharva\" (lit. Young Gandharva)." ;

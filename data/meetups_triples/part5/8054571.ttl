        mtp:hasAbstract        "Neil Andrew Carter (born 11 May 1958) is an English musician who has worked in diverse genres throughout his career. Classically trained, he became a professional rock musician at the age of 17 and initially had his first \"mainstream\" experience with singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan. He subsequently played guitar and keyboard for the hard rock band UFO, blues rock guitarist Gary Moore, and Wild Horses. He is credited for co-writing a number of Gary Moore's songs including the worldwide hit \"Empty Rooms\". At 30 he left the rock world and developed a different career as both teacher of woodwind (saxophone and clarinet) and as an ABRSM examiner. 2010 saw an unexpected return to rock with Gary Moore, playing festivals across Europe and a tour of Ukraine and Russia. Future tours and a Celtic rock album were to follow but this was curtailed by the death of Gary Moore in February 2011. On 30 April 2019, it was announced that he would return to UFO for their 'Last Orders' tour, following the death of Paul Raymond with Neil replacing Paul. The tour began in June 2019 in Germany with concerts and festival appearances. It is expected that following the USA dates in autumn 2019 there will be some concerts in 2020 as a continuation of the bandsâ€™ final 50th anniversary tour." ;

Leading an all-women's band from 1898 to 1912, she had an extremely successful career at a time when women were discouraged from such public activities. Her best-known group, Helen May Butler and Her Ladies' Military Band, was a favorite of President Theodore Roosevelt, and one of her compositions, \"Cosmopolitan American March\", was selected as the official march of the Republican Party during Roosevelt's 1904 election campaign." ;

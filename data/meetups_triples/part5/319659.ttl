        mtp:hasAbstract        "Stacy Ann Ferguson (born March 27, 1975), better known by her stage name Fergie (/ˈfɜːrɡi/), is an American singer and rapper. She first achieved chart success as part of the hip hop group the Black Eyed Peas. Her debut solo album, The Dutchess (2006), saw commercial success and spawned three Billboard Hot 100 number one singles: \"London Bridge\", \"Glamorous\", and \"Big Girls Don't Cry\". Although she vocally incorporates rapping into some of her performances, she does not consider herself a rapper. Fergie was originally a member of the children's television series Kids Incorporated and the girl group Wild Orchid. In 2001, she left the group and in the subsequent year joined the Black Eyed Peas. She worked with the Black Eyed Peas on two albums before releasing her debut solo album, The Dutchess, in 2006. She continued her collaboration with the Black Eyed Peas and released a further two albums with them, The E.N.D. (2009) and The Beginning (2010). Her second solo album, Double Dutchess, was released in 2017. Fergie has additionally appeared in various films, including Poseidon (2006), Grindhouse (2007), and Nine (2009). She launched her first fragrance, Outspoken, under Avon in May 2010 and has since released four more fragrances. Her footwear line, Fergie Footwear, was launched in 2009." ;

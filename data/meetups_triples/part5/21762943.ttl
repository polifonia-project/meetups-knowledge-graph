        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jonathan Dagan, (born February 16, 1982) known by his stage name J.Views, is a two-time Grammy nominated musician based in New York. As a songwriter, producer, remixer, and art director, J.Views is known for pushing the boundaries in the creative world, constantly innovating the dialog with his audience. Under the alias J.Views, he has collaborated with numerous guest vocalists and musicians. His production often incorporates nostalgic elements through the use of samples, analog tapes and synthesizers, and is often described as multilayered and detailed. NPR's All Songs Considered said, \"J.Views writes songs that whirl and clatter like tiny Rube Goldberg devices.\" In 2018, Dagan created the leading sample used in Drip Too Hard by American rappers Lil Baby and Gunna. The song was certified 5Ã— Platinum by the RIAA, and peaked at #4 on the US Billboard Hot 100. In February 2019, Nicki Minaj released her version of the song, titled \"Barbie Drip\". Another J.Views sample from the same Splice series was featured in the 2019 release by Australian musician Flume \"Levitate (feat. Reo Cragun)\". Among his international productions, Dagan produced the album Orot by the Israeli artist Avraham Tal. The album was certified Platinum in Israel, and its leading single is the most played song of the decade on Israeli radio, according to the Israeli society of music publishers ACUM." ;

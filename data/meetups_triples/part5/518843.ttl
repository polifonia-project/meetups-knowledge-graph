        mtp:hasAbstract        "Neil Sedaka (/səˈdækə/; born March 13, 1939) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. Since his music career began in 1957, he has sold millions of records worldwide and has written or co-written over 500 songs for himself and other artists, collaborating mostly with lyricists Howard \"Howie\" Greenfield and Phil Cody. After a short-lived tenure as a founding member of the doo-wop group the Tokens, Sedaka achieved a string of hit singles over the late 1950s and early 1960s, including \"Oh! Carol\" (1959), \"Calendar Girl\" (1960), \"Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen\" (1961) and \"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\" (1962). His popularity declined by the mid-1960s, but was revived in the mid-1970s, solidified by the 1975 US Billboard Hot 100 number ones \"Laughter in the Rain\" and \"Bad Blood\". Sedaka maintained a successful career as a songwriter, penning hits for other artists including \"Stupid Cupid\" (Connie Francis), \"(Is This the Way to) Amarillo\" (Tony Christie) and \"Love Will Keep Us Together\" (Captain & Tennille). He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1983 and continues to perform, mounting mini-concerts on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic." ;

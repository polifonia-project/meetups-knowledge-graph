        mtp:hasAbstract        "Charles Arthur Russell Jr. (May 21, 1951 – April 4, 1992) was an American cellist, composer, producer, singer, and musician from Iowa, whose work spanned a disparate range of styles. After studying contemporary composition and Indian classical music in California, Russell relocated to New York City in the mid-1970s, where he became involved with both Lower Manhattan's avant-garde community and later the city's burgeoning disco scene. His eclectic work spanned many of these influences, drawing variously on minimalism, dance, pop, folk, dub, new wave, and electronic music, and was often marked by his distinctive voice and adventurous production choices. Russell worked as musical director of the New York avant-garde venue the Kitchen in 1974 and 1975. Later embracing disco music, he produced or co-produced several underground dance hits under names such as Dinosaur L, Loose Joints, and Indian Ocean between 1978 and 1988, and he co-founded the label Sleeping Bag Records with Will Socolov in 1981. He amassed a large collection of unfinished recordings in the last two decades of his life owing to his perfectionism and difficulty completing full-length projects; the orchestral recording Tower of Meaning (1983) and vocal LP World of Echo (1986) were the only studio albums he issued under his name, in addition to the disco LP 24→24 Music (1981) under his Dinosaur L alias. Over the course of his career, he collaborated with a wide variety of artists, including poet Allen Ginsberg, musicians such as Peter Gordon, Peter Zummo, and Talking Heads, and DJs such as Walter Gibbons, Nicky Siano, and Steve D'Aquisto. Russell died from AIDS-related illnesses in 1992, still in relative obscurity and poverty. His profile rose in the 21st century owing to a series of musical releases (including collections of unreleased material) and biographical works. Several posthumous compilations of his music were released, including The World of Arthur Russell (2004) and Calling Out of Context (2004). The documentary Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell was released in 2008." ;

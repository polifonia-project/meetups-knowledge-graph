        mtp:hasAbstract        "David \"Fathead\" Newman (February 24, 1933 â€“ January 20, 2009) was an American jazz and rhythm-and-blues saxophonist, who made numerous recordings as a session musician and leader, but is best known for his work as a sideman on seminal 1950s and early 1960s recordings by Ray Charles. The AllMusic Guide to Jazz wrote that \"there have not been many saxophonists and flutists more naturally soulful than David 'Fathead' Newman.\" Newman was a leading exponent of the \"Texas Tenor\" saxophone style, a big-toned, bluesy approach popularized by jazz tenor players from that state." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Levi Celerio (April 30, 1910 â€“ April 2, 2002) was a Filipino composer and lyricist who is credited with writing over 4,000 songs. Celerio was recognized as a National Artist of the Philippines for Music and Literature in 1997. He is also known for using the leaf as a musical instrument which led to being recognized as the \"only man who could play music using a leaf\" by the Guinness Book of Records. This led to him making a guest appearance in television shows recorded outside the Philippines. Aside from being a musician, Celerio was also a poet and a film actor who appeared in various Philippine films of the 1950s and 1960s." ;

He plays the piano, keyboards and the tenor horn. Bates has been described as \"one of the most talented musicians Britain has produced... his work covers the entire spectrum of jazz, from early jazz through to bebop and free jazz to jazz-rock fusion.\" In additional to his jazz work, he is also a noted classical composer (writing both large- and small-scale compositions on commission), theatre composer, and has taught as a professor at various European music schools. As a leader, his bands have included Human Chain, Delightful Precipice, Quiet Nights, Powder Room Collapse Orchestra and Belov√®d, and he was also a leading figure in Loose Tubes and Bill Bruford's Earthworks." ;

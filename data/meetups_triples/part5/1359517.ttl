        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alvin Singleton (born December 28, 1940; Brooklyn, New York) is a composer from the United States. Born and raised in New York City, he received his music education from New York University (B.A.), studying with Hall Overton and Charles Wuorinen, and the Yale School of Music (M.M.), studying with Yehudi Wyner and Mel Powell. With Fulbright Scholarships, he studied at the Saint Cecilia Academy in Rome with Goffredo Petrassi. From 1971 to 1985 he lived in Europe, and then he returned to the United States after being appointed as the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra resident composer, and served in that position from 1985-1988. He served as a resident artist at Spelman College in Atlanta. He was also a Rockefeller Foundation grantee in a series entitled \"Meet the Composer.\" Singleton's music shows the evidence of a wide range of influences - \"from Mahler to Monk, Bird to Bernstein, James Baldwin to Bach, Santana to Prince\" - and often incorporates aspects of theatre and surprise. Notable are his set of eight Argoru pieces for various solo instruments, composed over the period from 1968 to 2002. His choral ballet TRUTH (2006), scored for mixed chorus, dancers and an ensemble of 10 instruments, is based on the life of human rights crusader Sojourner Truth. His piano concerto BluesKonzert had its Carnegie Hall debut in 2010 with soloist Ursula Oppens and the American Composers Orchestra. Albany Records has issued a series of recordings, including Extensions of a Dream (2002, percussion music), Sing to the Sun (2007, choral and chamber music) and Sweet Chariot (2014, solo and chamber music). The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus has recorded PraiseMaker. The four string quartets have been recorded by the Momenta Quartet." ;

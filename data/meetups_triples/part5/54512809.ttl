        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alba Farelo i Solé (born 7 March 1997), known professionally as Bad Gyal, is a Spanish singer, songwriter, DJ and model. Known for her distinctive overall use of Auto-Tune, Bad Gyal has developed a strong cult following ever since her musical career began in 2016 with her interpretation of Rihanna's \"Work\" in the Catalan language. She then continued to make music as an independent artist, releasing records like \"Indapanden\", \"Jacaranda\" or \"Fiebre\". Bad Gyal later released two mixtapes: Slow Wine Mixtape (2016) and Worldwide Angel (2018), which consecrated her as an emerging artist within the Spanish urban scene. Farelo signed Interscope and Aftercluv a year later and saw mainstream acclaim with songs like \"Santa María\", \"Zorra\" or \"Alocao\", the latter becoming the number-one song in Spain in 2019. 2021 saw the release of her first project as a signed artist Warm Up, as well as the three-sided single Soundsystem: The Final Releases. Other ventures of Bad Gyal besides music include fashion and modelling. She made her modelling debut at Andrés Sardá's Spring/Summer 2022 show at Madrid Fashion Week. As for social activism, Farelo has been an advocate for gender equality, LGBT rights and social justice." ;

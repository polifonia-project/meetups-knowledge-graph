He was a member of the band The Psychotics who became Senseless Things in 1986. Senseless Things made four studio albums, achieved two UK Top 20 hits and released many other singles in their nine years together, before splitting up in 1995. Jamie Hewlett was a big fan of the band and designed many of their sleeves. Senseless Things were known for their relentless touring schedule which saw them perform across the UK, as well as Europe, Japan and the United States. When the Senseless Things split up, Browne formed a new band Delakota, which he toured with for a couple of years. Delakota made their first live appearance on Newsnight and released the album One Love in 1998, tracks from which received remixes from Fatboy Slim, David Holmes, the pre-UNKLE producer Tim Goldsworthy, Royal Trux, the artist Four Tet (under his \"Joshua Falken\" moniker), Freddy Fresh and others. In 2022 the album saw a Deluxe Digital Edition release, alongside the original remixes and B-Sides. A visual was released for the Fatboy Slim remix of the single \"C'mon Cincinnati\" in September of 2022, which was assembled from recovered footage of the first Delakota concert in 1998, performed \"200ft underground\" at the Hellfire Caves in High Wycombe.

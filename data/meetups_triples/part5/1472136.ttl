        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Victor Chesnutt (November 12, 1964 â€“ December 25, 2009) was an American singer-songwriter from Athens, Georgia. His first album, Little, was released in 1990. His commercial breakthrough came in 1996 with the release of Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation, a charity record of alternative artists covering his songs. Chesnutt released 17 albums during his career, including two produced by Michael Stipe, and a 1996 release on Capitol Records, About to Choke. His musical style has been described by Bryan Carroll of AllMusic as a \"skewed, refracted version of Americana that is haunting, funny, poignant, and occasionally mystical, usually all at once\". Injuries from a 1983 car accident left him partially paralyzed; he used a wheelchair and had limited use of his hands." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Kim Leith Salmon (born 24 January 1957) is an Australian rock musician and songwriter from Perth. He has worked in various groups including The Scientists, Beasts of Bourbon, Kim Salmon and the Surrealists, Kim Salmon and the Business, and Darling Downs. Australian rock musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described Salmon as one of the first Australians to \"embrace wholeheartedly the emergent punk phenomenon of the mid-to-late 1970s\" with The Scientists. He declared that Beasts of Bourbon were \"masters of uncompromising gutbucket blues and hard-edged rock'n'roll\". In 2004 Salmon was inducted into the West Australian Music Industry Association Hall of Fame and in 2007, into the Music Victoria Awards Hall of Fame." ;

The name is a combination of the first letter 'K' of his last name 'Kim' and the English word 'Will', which means will. He debuted in 2007 and has since become known for his chart-topping ballads. He has also been dubbed the \"Prince of OST\" for his frequent Korean drama soundtrack appearances. K.Will has released four full-length albums: Left Heart (2007), Missing You (2009), The Third Album (2012–2013), and The Fourth Album (2017–2018)." ;

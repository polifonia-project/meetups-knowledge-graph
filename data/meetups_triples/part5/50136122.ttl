        mtp:hasAbstract        "Li Ye (simplified Chinese: 李冶; traditional Chinese: 李治; Wade–Giles: Li Yeh; died 784), also known by her courtesy name Li Jilan (Chinese: 李季蘭), was a Tang dynasty Chinese courtesan, musician, nun, and poet. She was known for her poetic talent as well as her beauty. In the tumultuous years of the late Tang, she was accused of treason for poems denigrating the imperial house of Tang that the rebel leader Zhu Ci forced her to write. She was condemned to death and executed in 784. Li is one of the few Tang-dynasty women whose poetry has survived." ;

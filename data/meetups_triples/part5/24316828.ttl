        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Goodier (born 1954) is an English musician. He has been the bassist for the rock band Jethro Tull from 2007 until the band went on a hiatus in 2012, and again from 2017 when Ian Anderson started to tour again using the Jethro Tull name, with Goodier and keyboardist John O'Hara the only former Jethro Tull members to join Anderson. Despite having been a member of the band for more than a decade, Goodier had not appeared on a studio album with Jethro Tull until 2022's The Zealot Gene. Goodier has appeared with many artists from the world of jazz, pop and rock and also worked extensively in theatre pit bands. Since 2002, he has been touring worldwide with Ian Anderson. In the summer of 2006, he accompanied British soprano Lesley Garrett, on her sold out tour of the United Kingdom. He recorded with UK-based Celtic/jazz group Carmina on their album My Crescent City, produced by DÃ³nal Lunny, and also appears as a guest on American guitarist Brooks Williams' album, Oh Baby! During the Jethro Tull hiatus Goodier worked with Ian Anderson on his solo album Thick As A Brick 2: Whatever happened to Gerald Bostock? as well as the follow-up album Homo Erraticus and joined the TAAB2 tour." ;

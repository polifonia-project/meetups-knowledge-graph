        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ko Ji-yong (born July 1, 1980) is a South Korean singer and businessman. He was a member of Sechs Kies, a first generation K-pop idol dance group which disbanded in 2000 but reunited in 2016. Unlike most of the other members, Ko left the entertainment industry and started his own company. He made his first television appearance in years when he appeared at Sechs Kies' reunion special on Infinite Challenge. Due to his family and work commitments he did not sign a contract with the group's new label YG Entertainment or promote with them as a performer but is considered to be part of the group. From January 2017 to May 2019, he and his son appeared on the reality show The Return of Superman." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brian Gilbert Greenway (born October 1, 1951) is a Canadian guitarist, vocalist and harmonicist, most notable for playing in the rock bands April Wine, Mashmakhan, and the Dudes. Greenway performed with April Wine from 1977 to 1986 when the band split, and again from 1992 to the present day. After April Wine broke up in 1986, Greenway embarked on a solo career and recorded his debut album Serious Business which continued the traditional April Wine mix of hard rock and ballads. It is often said that Greenway is responsible for giving April Wine a \"harder edged\" sound. In 2016, Greenway formed Brian Greenway's Blues Bus with former April Wine bandmate Gary Moffet (guitar/vocals), along with Craig Miller (harp/vocals), Mark Higden (drums), and Lloyd Dallaire (bass)." ;

The daughter of Adam Hamilton, who taught music at the University of Edinburgh, she was born Bertha Drechsler Hamilton in Edinburgh. With her sister Emily, she studied violin in Leipzig with Ferdinand David. She performed with her father's quartet, which included her sister and her brother Carl, in the United Kingdom.

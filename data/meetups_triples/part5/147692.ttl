        mtp:hasAbstract        "Timothy W. Alexander (born April 10, 1965), also credited as \"Herb\" Alexander, is an American musician best known as the drummer for the rock band Primus. Alexander has played on the majority of Primus's discography, including some of the band's most well known albums such as Frizzle Fry (1990), Sailing the Seas of Cheese (1991), Pork Soda (1993) and Tales from the Punchbowl (1995). Alexander has been in the band across three stints; he initially left the band in 1996 and rejoined in 2003 before leaving again in 2010 and re-joining in 2013. Outside of Primus, Alexander has played in several projects with Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan including the bands Puscifer and A Perfect Circle, and also played in the theatrical performance art group Blue Man Group. Alexander has been hailed for his \"polyrhythmic\" playing." ;

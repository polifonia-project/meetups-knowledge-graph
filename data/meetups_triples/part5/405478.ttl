After a visit to France in 1791, he became a staunch supporter of the ideals of the French Revolution. He was also an influential vegetarianism activist. He is also known for his collections of English nursery rhymes, such as \"Roses Are Red\" and \"Little Bo-Peep\", in Gammer Gurton's Garland or The Nursery Parnassus, published in London by Joseph Johnson." ;

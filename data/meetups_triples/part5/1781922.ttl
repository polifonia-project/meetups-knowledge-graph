        mtp:hasAbstract        "Marissa Nadler (born April 5, 1981) is an American musician and fine artist. Active since 2000, she is currently signed to Sacred Bones Records and Bella Union, and released her ninth full-length studio album, The Path of the Clouds, in October 2021. As a singer-songwriter, her music has been characterized as blending \"traditional folk, Gothic Americana, and dreamy pop into an original musical framework\". Her music \"is rooted in old-school country and folk but brings in elements of experimental and black metal\". Sometimes the term \"dream folk\" has been invoked to describe her work. Singing in a mezzo-soprano, Nadler has received acclaim for her vocals. Her voice was described by Pitchfork as one \"you would follow straight into Hades\", and also \"textured and angelic, with just a hint of pain captured within her iridescent falsetto\". The Boston Globe said, \"She has a voice that, in mythological times, could have lured men to their deaths at sea, an intoxicating soprano drenched in gauzy reverb that hits bell-clear heights, lingers, and tapers off like rings of smoke\"." ;

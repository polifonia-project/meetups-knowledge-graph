        mtp:hasAbstract        "Walter William Bygraves OBE (16 October 1922 â€“ 31 August 2012), best known by the stage name Max Bygraves (adopted in honour of Max Miller), was an English comedian, singer, actor and variety performer. He appeared on his own television shows, sometimes performing comedy sketches between songs. He made twenty Royal Variety Performance appearances and presented numerous programmes, including Family Fortunes between 1983 and 1985. His catchphrase \"I wanna tell you a story\" became an integral part of his act, although it had originated with comedian Mike Yarwood impersonating Bygraves." ;

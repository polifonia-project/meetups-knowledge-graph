        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joseph Brooks, born Joseph Kaplan (March 11, 1938 â€“ May 22, 2011), was an American composer, director, producer, and screenwriter. He was a prolific writer of advertising jingles and wrote the hit songs \"My Ship Is Comin' In\", \"If Ever I See You Again\", and \"You Light Up My Life\", the last for the hit film of the same name that he also wrote, directed, and produced. In his later years he became the subject of an investigation after being accused of a series of casting-couch rapes. He was indicted in 2009, but killed himself on May 22, 2011, before his trial." ;

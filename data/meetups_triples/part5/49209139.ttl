        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gavin Dunne (born May 6, 1980), better known by the name of his music project \"Miracle of Sound\", is an Irish indie musician known for his music inspired by video games, films, and TV shows. While not widely known in his home country of Ireland, his music is very popular with the online gaming community, and he has been described as Ireland's most successful indie musician. Miracle of Sound is generally a one-man-band, though Dunne occasionally collaborates with other musicians and singers. His songs vary widely in genre, typically using a genre that best fits the song's subject; these have included rock, pop, electronic rock, hard rock, heavy metal, alternative rock, tribal music, dubstep, jazz, and even doo-wop." ;

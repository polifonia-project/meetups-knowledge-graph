        mtp:hasAbstract        "George Carroll, better known as Slaine, is an American rapper and actor. Born in Boston, Massachusetts, where he spent his childhood and teenage years. Carroll moved to New York City in the mid-1990s, where he adopted the moniker of Slaine and started to rap and record hip-hop. In the early 2000s, Carroll became a growing figure in the Boston hip-hop scene, releasing several mixtapes, and the LP Stereotypez (2007) with his group Special Teamz. Later, A Brand You Can Trust (2009) was released, by the rap supergroup La Coka Nostra, where Carroll is joined by Ill Bill, and House of Pain. Carroll’s first solo album A World With No Skies 2.0. (2011) peaked at 33 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums it, 22 on the Top Rap Albums, 29 on US Independent Albums, and 4 on Top Heatseekers. Carroll’s subsequent albums with La Coka Nostra were Masters of the Dark Arts (2012) and To Thine Own Self Be True (2016). On his own he followed up with The Boston Project (2013), The King of Everything Else (2014), Anti-Hero (2017), One Day (2019), and The Things We Can't Forgive (2021). While rising on the hip-hop scene, Carroll became an actor. For his directorial film debut, Gone Baby Gone (2007), actor Ben Affleck thought he had the right look for a part and auditioned him successfully. However before Carroll was completely onboard, Affleck had to do some additional convincing, since the producers were reluctant to hire a first time actor. A few years later, Affleck rehired Carroll for the movie The Town (2010). Together with the rest of the cast, they won Best ensemble cast at the 2010 National Board of Review, and Washington DC Area Film Critics Association Awards. Carroll continued acting in motion pictures with roles in Killing Them Softly (2012), Girl House (2014), Central Intelligence (2016), Wheelman (2017), etc." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Glenn Barrie Shorrock AM (born 30 June 1944) is an English-born Australian singer-songwriter. He was a founding member of rock bands the Twilights, Axiom, Little River Band and post LRB spin-off trio Birtles Shorrock Goble, as well as being a solo performer. The Twilights had eight consecutive national hit singles including \"Needle in a Haystack\" and \"What's Wrong with the Way I Live\". Axiom's top 10 hits were \"Arkansas Grass\", \"Little Ray of Sunshine\" and \"My Baby's Gone\". Little River Band had national and international chart success, including the Shorrock-penned \"Emma\", \"Help Is on Its Way\" and \"Cool Change\". Shorrock was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 1991 and as a member of Little River Band in 2004. In May 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th-anniversary celebrations, named \"Cool Change\" as one of the APRA Top 30 Australian songs of all time." ;

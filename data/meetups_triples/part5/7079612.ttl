McCurdy's breakthrough role as Sam Puckett in the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly (2007–2012) earned her various awards, including four Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. She reprised the character in the iCarly spin-off series Sam & Cat (2013–2014) before leaving Nickelodeon. McCurdy also appeared in the television series Malcolm in the Middle (2003–2005), Zoey 101 (2005), Lincoln Heights (2007), True Jackson, VP (2009–2010), and Victorious (2012). She produced, wrote, and starred in her own webseries, What's Next for Sarah? (2014), and led the science-fiction series Between (2015–2016). McCurdy independently released her debut single, \"So Close\", in 2009. She released her debut EP, Not That Far Away, in 2010, followed in 2012 by the Jennette McCurdy EP and the Jennette McCurdy album. The lead single, \"Generation Love\", reached number 44 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs. In 2017, McCurdy quit acting and decided to pursue a career in writing and directing. In early 2020 she performed a one-woman show, I'm Glad My Mom Died, in Los Angeles and New York City; further dates were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, she began hosting an interview podcast, Empty Inside. In 2022, she released a well-reviewed and best-selling memoir, I'm Glad My Mom Died, describing her career as a child star and the abusive behavior of her deceased mother." ;

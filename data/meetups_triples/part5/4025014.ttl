She also participated in master classes with Walter Susskind and Leonard Slatkin in St. Louis and Igor Markevich and Herbert Blomstedt in Europe. Although primarily dedicated to the OONY, she has appeared as a guest conductor with numerous opera companies and orchestras internationally, including the Mariinsky Theatre, Opera Australia, the Hamburg State Opera, the National Theatre in Prague, the Frankfurt Opera, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, and the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra among others.

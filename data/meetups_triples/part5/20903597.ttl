        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter Walker is an American folk guitarist noted for virtuosic performances fusing the Indian classical and Spanish flamenco traditions. Walker was recognized principally for his recorded output in the mid-to-late sixties. His status has risen following his rediscovery by younger generations of American and European outsider folk artists. Today, he is placed among the ranks of notable American finger-pickers Sandy Bull, John Fahey, Robbie Basho and Leo Kottke. This new esteem has granted him a renewed platform for both touring and recording." ;

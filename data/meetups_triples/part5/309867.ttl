During the early 2000s, she released two top-selling albums: The Spirit Room and Hotel Paper. She won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals with Santana for their 2002 single, \"The Game of Love\". As a solo recording artist, she signed to Madonna's Maverick record label in early 2001, and released her debut album The Spirit Room later that year. The album contained the hit singles \"Everywhere\" and \"All You Wanted\" and was followed up with Hotel Paper in 2003. In 2005, she formed the country music duo the Wreckers with Jessica Harp, and produced the Grammy-nominated single \"Leave the Pieces\". The Wreckers disbanded in 2007 to pursue their respective solo careers. Since then, she has released extended plays in 2010 and 2011, and a third solo album, Hopeless Romantic, on April 7, 2017. Her fourth studio album, The Trouble with Fever, was released on September 16, 2022." ;

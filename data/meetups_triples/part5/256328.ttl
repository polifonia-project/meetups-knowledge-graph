        mtp:hasAbstract        "Ivor Bertie Gurney (28 August 1890 â€“ 26 December 1937) was an English poet and composer, particularly of songs. He was born and raised in Gloucester. He suffered from bipolar disorder through much of his life and spent his last 15 years in psychiatric hospitals. Critical evaluation of Gurney has been complicated by this, and also by the need to assess both his poetry and his music. Gurney himself thought of music as his true vocation: \"The brighter visions brought music; the fainter verse\"." ;

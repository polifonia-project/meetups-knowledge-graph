        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rick White (born 5 December 1970) is a Canadian musician and singer-songwriter. Born in Moncton, New Brunswick, he was a member of indie bands Eric's Trip, Elevator, Perplexus, and The Unintended. White first played music, in a band called \"Bloodstain\", in 1984, before starting his own band \"in 1986\", called \"T.C.I.B\", which later transitioned into the band name, \"The Underdogs\", which lasted from the summer of 1987, until June 1988. By the summer of 1989, The Underdogs had broken up, and Rick had joined another band, \"The Forest\", which lasted from the 1989, until June 1990, with a one-off recording session happening in December, 1990. Prior to Eric's Trip, and while in Eric's Trip, White also recorded two solo-produced albums, one in March 1990, and another in August 1991, but both were not released until 2022. Known for lo-fi recording, he has also recorded and produced music for The Sadies, , Joel Plaskett, One Hundred Dollars, Dog Day, HotKid and his former Eric's Trip bandmate Julie Doiron. White released his first solo album, The Rick White Album, in late 2005. He followed it with Memoreaper in 2007. White's next album, 137, is a double album which was released in 2009 on Blue Fog Recordings. He released a record in 2019, The Opening, and was recorded with Eiyn Sof. His most latest album, with all original material, is Where It's Fine, which was released in 2021." ;

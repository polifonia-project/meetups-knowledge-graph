        mtp:hasAbstract        "Rene Vasquez (born November 5, 1968), known by the stage name Peace 586 (and formerly MC Peace), is an American Christian hip hop producer and emcee. His career began in the late 1980s, and has continued until the present. As a beatmaker, who has also rapped, Peace 586 is best known for expressing his Christian faith. He has made a mark with his signature, sample-based production style and down-to-earth lyrical content. His name is derived from the month and year that he became a Christian: May 1986." ;

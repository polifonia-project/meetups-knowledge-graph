        mtp:hasAbstract        "Yang Jing (Chinese: 楊靜; pinyin: Yáng jìng) is a composer and pipa soloist of Chinese origin. Between 1997 and 2009 she often toured in Japan. Since 2001, she has lived in Switzerland. Her composition premiere recording was Der Grosse Wagen (瀚空七星) by the First European Chinese Ensemble; A Traveller's Chant. For composer and pipa soloist Jing Yang, the instrument is as free as a person's spirit. With her pipa, she has made concert tours through various continents over the past 30 years. In her home, a garden in the middle of Switzerland, she discovered many other sounds of the pipa." ;

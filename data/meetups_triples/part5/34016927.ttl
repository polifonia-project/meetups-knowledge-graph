        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), known professionally as Skrillex, is an American DJ and music producer. Growing up in Northeast Los Angeles and Northern California, he joined the post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount [2004] and Heroine [2006]) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and the Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual \"100 Bands You Need to Know\" issue. After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. He ceased production of the album, however, and began performing under the name Skrillex, distributing the My Name Is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page. Subsequently, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late 2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid-2011, both of which have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he received five Grammy Award nominations at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: \"Best Dance/Electronica Album\", \"Best Dance Recording\", and \"Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical\". In December 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll. The same month, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year. Skrillex has won eight Grammy Awards, more than any other electronic dance music artist. Skrillex has collaborated with Diplo and Boys Noize to form the groups Jack Ãœ and Dog Blood respectively. It was announced on Moore's 29th birthday, that he reunited with From First to Last and released a single named \"Make War\". In 2017, Skrillex produced and mixed 8, the eighth studio album by rock band Incubus. In July 2017, Skrillex released another single featuring debuting solo artist Poo Bear." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Álex Ubago (born Alejandro Martínez de Ubago Rodríguez on January 29, 1981, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country, Spain) is a Spanish singer-songwriter. He is especially known for his heartfelt voice and his ballads. He was able to record his debut album ¿Qué pides tú? when manager Iñigo Argomaniz that used to go to Alex's cousin's bar heard a demo that Alex made for his girlfriend. His first album contains songs from that first demo recording; the songs are \"Sabes\" and \"Hay Que Ver\". Alex started to tour national radios with his guitar to sing his songs live and get further exposure. Eventually, this strategy worked, and his album finally hit the charts. But he reached absolute fame with the publication of the song \"Sin Miedo A Nada\", featuring Amaia Montero, which is his biggest hit to date." ;

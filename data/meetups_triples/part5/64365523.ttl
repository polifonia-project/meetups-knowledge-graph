        mtp:hasAbstract        "Terence Lam Ka Him (Chinese: 林家謙; born 3 September 1991) is a Hong Kong composer, singer-songwriter, and record producer. Lam had a musical interest at a young age, having started to learn playing the piano when he was four or five years old. He attended the Lingnan University, where he received the Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Contemporary English Studies in 2013. During his university studies, Lam participated in several college singing competitions, where he met the singer-songwriter Chet Lam who brought him into the music industry. In 2014, he became a composer, signing a contract for Warner Chappell Music Hong Kong where at one point he was composing one song a week. Lam has composed songs for the singers Eason Chan, Jason Chan, Hins Cheung, Pakho Chau, JW, Charmaine Fong, Alfred Hui, Eman Lam, Janice Vidal, Rainie Yang, and Joey Yung. Pakho Chau's 2014 song \"About Us\" (Chinese: 關於我們) was Lam's first composition to achieve commercial success. Lam's composition of the JW song \"A Lifetime of Contradictions\" (Chinese: 矛盾一生) was the first to receive widespread attention. Lam's songs are in the traditional genres of pop music and Cantopop though he puts his own twist on his songs through tempo changes and melody trends. In 2019, Lam made a career change from being a composer to being a singer-songwriter. In January of that year, he released the song \"NEXT\" (Chinese: 下一位前度), which hit several charts and became the first song that made him well-known as a singer. The next year, he released \"Solitude\" (Chinese: 一人之境), which was broadly praised. In May 2020, he released his debut album, Major in Minor whose name was inspired by how he is an independent musician. Although he writes songs for a record label, he remains an independent singer who is not signed to a label or a talent manager. Lam has received composer, arranger, and singer awards from RTHK, Ultimate 903, and ViuTV. He received the best composer award from RTHK in 2016 and 2017, the best new artist award from Ultimate 903 in 2020, and the best composer, best arranger, and best male singer awards from the ViuTV Chill Club awards in 2021." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jesus \"Jesse\" Ernesto Pintado Andrade (July 12, 1969 â€“ August 27, 2006) was a Mexican-American guitarist best known as the lead guitarist for the British grindcore band Napalm Death. He started in the grindcore band Terrorizer where he recorded the album World Downfall, the first album to feature Pete Sandoval who would later leave the band to join Morbid Angel. He lived in Huntington Park, California (his home address was even on the booklet of the \"World Downfall\" CD for contacting), but moved to Birmingham, England after he joined Napalm Death, where he replaced guitarist Bill Steer immediately prior to the recording of their album Harmony Corruption. In 2004 he officially left Napalm Death; instead of replacing him, the band has since continued as a four-piece. Pintado later revived Terrorizer, recruiting Tony Norman of Monstrosity and Anthony Rezhawk of Resistant Culture; he and Pete Sandoval were the only original members. Besides Terrorizer and Napalm Death he also played in Lock Up and Brujeria. Both bands also featured Napalm Death bass player Shane Embury. Pintado died at Erasmus MC hospital in Rotterdam, Netherlands, of liver failure." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alexandra Ioana Stan (born 10 June 1989) is a Romanian singer. Born in Constan»õa, she made her worldwide breakthrough with the 2010 single \"Mr. Saxobeat\", which was written and produced by Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi. They had previously discovered Stan at a karaoke bar in 2009 and signed her to their label, Maan Records. \"Mr. Saxobeat\" had followed the singer's debut single, \"Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)\" (2009), which brought her moderate fame in Romania. \"Mr. Saxobeat\" quickly achieved commercial success locally and abroad, reaching number one in several countries and gathering various certifications. Saxobeats, Stan's debut studio album, was released in August 2011 and features the follow-up singles \"Get Back (ASAP)\" (2011) and \"Lemonade\" (2012), which had moderate success in Europe. An alleged altercation with Prodan in 2013 and a lawsuit against him preceded the release of Stan's second album, Unlocked, which would eventually be issued in August 2014. Two of its singles, \"Dance\" (2014) and \"Cherry Pop\" (2014), were successful in Japan. Stan's third studio album, Alesta, was released in March 2016 and included a collaboration with Inna and Daddy Yankee on \"We Wanna\" (2015); the single went on to reach the top 60 in several countries. Mami, her fourth record, followed in 2018. Preceding the release of its last single was Stan's feature on Manuel Riva's \"Miami\" (2018), which peaked within the top ten in Romania and on Billboard's Dance Club Songs chart. Stan has received a number of awards and nominations, including the European Border Breakers Award, a Japan Gold Disc Award, an MTV Europe Music Award and two Romanian Music Awards. She is also referred to as one of the most successful Romanian artists alongside Inna." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Peter London (born Pedrinho Londres; 28 September 1982 in Sweden) is a Swedish bassist. He is best known as the bassist for the Swedish sleaze band Crashdïet, but he also performs as a one-man band, . As Alter Egon, London plays all the instruments himself and sings in Swedish. The songs are mostly about himself and sexual freedom. Since 2015, London has been the bass-player of RAC/pop rock-band Bedårande Barn where Jimmie Åkesson plays keyboard. London married Swedish model and former Miss Sweden title-holder Isabel Lestapier Winqvist on 25 June 2010 at the Hedvig Eleonora Church in Stockholm. They were divorced in March 2012." ;

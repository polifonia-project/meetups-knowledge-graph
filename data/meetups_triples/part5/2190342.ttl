Her professional singing career started in 1976 when she obtained a job as a backing vocalist for the national touring company of the musical drama The Wiz. Eventually, she obtained the role of Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West, during the six-month national tour. Prior to her appearance in The Wiz, Lynn appeared in an episode of The Gong Show, a daytime entertainment show during June 1976, performing Joe Cocker's \"You Are So Beautiful\"." ;

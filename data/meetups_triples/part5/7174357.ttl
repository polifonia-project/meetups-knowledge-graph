        mtp:hasAbstract        "Tatjana \"Tanja\" Savić (Serbian Cyrillic: Татјана \"Тања\" Савић; born 20 March 1985) is a Serbian pop-folk singer who rose to prominence on the first season of Zvezde Granda in 2004, finishing third. Following the show, Savić was signed to Grand Production through which she released her debut album, Tako mlada, to general success. With songs \"Suknjica\" and \"Gde ljubav putuje\" which were featured in movies Guča! (2006) and Srpski ožiljci (2009), respectively, she received further notice. After facing career setbacks, Savić managed to retrieve popularity with her fourth album Stranci (2019), on which she collaborated with hip-hop duo Corona and Rimski. In 2011, she married Serbian-Australian businessman from Queensland, Dušan Jovaničević, with whom she has two sons. The couple separated in 2020, following a highly publicized custody battle, in which Savić accused her then-husband of relocating their children to Australia against her will. In March 2021, she was eventually reunited with her sons after close to a year of separation." ;

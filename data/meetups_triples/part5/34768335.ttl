        mtp:hasAbstract        "Nayvadius DeMun Cash (born Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn; born November 20, 1983), better known by the stage name Future, is an American rapper. Known for his mumble-styled vocals and prolific output, Future is considered a pioneer of the use of melody and auto-tune in modern trap music. Due to the sustained contemporary popularity of his musical style, he is commonly regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Future signed a recording contract with A1 Recordings and Epic Records in 2011, and released the albums Pluto (2012) and Honest (2014), which contained the platinum singles \"Turn On the Lights\", \"Honest\", \"Move That Dope\" (featuring Pharrell Williams and Pusha T), and \"I Won\" (featuring Kanye West). He then achieved critical and commercial success with DS2 (2015) and its singles \"Fuck Up Some Commas\" and \"Where Ya At\" (featuring Drake), and followed it up with Evol (2016) and its lead single \"Low Life\" (featuring The Weeknd). Future's eponymous fifth album and its successor Hndrxx (both 2017) made him the first artist since 2014 to debut two albums in consecutive weeks atop the US Billboard 200; the former contained the international hits \"Used to This\" (featuring Drake) and \"Mask Off\". After departing A1, Future released the albums The Wizrd (2019) and High Off Life (2020), which featured the RIAA certified Diamond single \"Life Is Good\" (featuring Drake). In 2021, Future achieved his first number-one single on the Hot 100 after a record-breaking 125 entries after featuring with Young Thug on Drake's \"Way 2 Sexy\". The album I Never Liked You (2022) spawned his second number-one hit, \"Wait for U\", which also became his highest charting single as a lead artist. Future released the mixtapes Beast Mode (with Zaytoven), 56 Nights, and What a Time to Be Alive (with Drake) in 2015; the latter included the song \"Jumpman\". He released the full-length collaborative projects Super Slimey (2017) with Young Thug, Wrld on Drugs (2018) with Juice Wrld, and Pluto x Baby Pluto (2020) with Lil Uzi Vert. Among the best selling musicians, Future's accolades include a Grammy Award at the 61st Grammy Awards for Best Rap Performance for \"King's Dead\" alongside Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, and James Blake." ;

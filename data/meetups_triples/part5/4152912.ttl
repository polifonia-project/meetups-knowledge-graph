        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joshua Rifkin (born April 22, 1944 in New York) is an American conductor, keyboard player, and musicologist who is currently a Professor of Music at Boston University. As a performer he has recorded music by composers from Antoine Busnois to Silvestre Revueltas, and as a scholar has published research on composers from the Renaissance to the 20th century. He is famed among classical musicians and aficionados for his increasingly influential theory that most of Bach's choral works were sung with only one singer per choral line. Rifkin argued: \"So long as we define 'chorus' in the conventional modern sense, then Bach's chorus, with few exceptions, simply did not exist.\" He is best known by the general public, however, for having played a central role in the ragtime revival in the 1970s, with the three albums he recorded of Scott Joplin's works for Nonesuch Records." ;

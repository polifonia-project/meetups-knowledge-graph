        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sylvia Rhone (born March 11, 1952) is an American music industry executive. She is the chair and CEO of Epic Records, a label owned by Sony Music Entertainment. Rhone is regarded as the most influential female executive in the history of the music business. Named chairman and CEO of Epic Records in 2019, a division of Sony Entertainment, Rhone has helmed senior positions at all three major record companies and was the first woman to be named CEO of a major record label owned by a Fortune 500 company, and the first African American woman in history to attain such a title. Rhone served previously in senior positions at Vested In Culture, Universal Motown, Elektra Entertainment Group, and Atlantic Records. In October 2004, Rhone was appointed president of Motown Records and executive vice president of Universal Records. Prior to her Universal Motown role, Rhone served as chairwoman and CEO of the Elektra Entertainment Group. Rhone's appointment in 1994 as chairwoman and CEO of EEG established her as the only African American and the first woman in the history of the recording industry to attain such a title." ;

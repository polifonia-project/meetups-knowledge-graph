He is a native of Philadelphia, United States. A pioneering DJ in the American rave scene during the early 1990s, Wink was the most prominent exponent of the tribal forms of techno and house in the U.S. In 1995, he released several hits, including \"Don't Laugh\" (as Winx), \"I'm Ready\" (as Size 9) (which hit number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart), and \"Higher State of Consciousness,\" which topped the dance charts in Europe. He has had many club hits such as \"How's Your Evening So Far?\" (samples Lil Louis's \"French Kiss\") and \"Superfreak (Freak)\" and has also gained much attention for his remixes of Stabbing Westward, FC Kahuna, Paul Oakenfold, Moby, Towa Tei, Ladytron and Depeche Mode, among others." ;

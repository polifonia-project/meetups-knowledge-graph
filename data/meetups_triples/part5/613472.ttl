He was the guitarist and a founding member of the Ramones, a band that helped pioneer the punk movement. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2009, Ramone appeared on Time's list of \"The 10 Greatest Electric-Guitar Players\". He ranked No. 8 on Spin's 2012 list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and No. 28 on Rolling Stone's similarly titled 2015 list. Alongside his music career, Ramone appeared in nearly a dozen films, in documentaries, and on television. Ramone's autobiography, Commando, was released posthumously in 2012." ;

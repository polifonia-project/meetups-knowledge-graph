They are recognizable by their plague doctor-style golden masks, which serve to intrigue the public as well as keeping their identities hidden. It was widely believed that Claptone is a single person, but after the public realized that Claptone often performed at three venues at once, the rumor started to spread that Claptone was three individuals. Claptone has performed at iconic venues including HÃ¯ Ibiza (formally Space), Pacha and Tomorrowland." ;

Barry wrote or rewrote screenplays for several notable films including The River, Eyes of Laura Mars, and Rhinoceros, Me, Myself and I, and A Marriage - Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz (PBS/American Playhouse Production). Barry appeared as himself in the film documentary Pablo, about the graphic artist and film director Pablo Ferro. Barry resides in Redding, Connecticut, but is frequently in London for theater work.

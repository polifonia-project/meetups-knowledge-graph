        mtp:hasAbstract        "Gary Ronnie Stewart (May 28, 1944 â€“ December 16, 2003) was an American musician and songwriter, known for his distinctive vibrato voice and his outlaw country sound influenced by southern rock. At the height of his popularity in the mid-1970s, Time magazine described him as the \"king of honkytonk.\" He had a series of country chart hits from the mid- to late 1970s, the biggest of which was \"She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart in 1975. On December 16, 2003, Stewart died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, one month after the death of his wife." ;

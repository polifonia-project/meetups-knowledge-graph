        mtp:hasAbstract        "Sophie Viney (born 1974) is an English composer and arranger. Her compositions have been performed at significant venues such as the Royal Festival Hall, Wigmore Hall and St. Martin-in-the-Fields and her music has featured in the Spitalfields Festival and the Brighton Festival. In February 1999, Viney received critical acclaim in The Times for her work Music of the Spheres which was described as \"eerily conjured\". Her choral work Missing God was commissioned under the Society for the Promotion of New Music's Adopt a Composer programme and performed by the London Oriana Choir in 2003. She has written for the Philharmonia and has also written for theatre groups such as Watford Palace Theatre, and Barbican Studio Theatre. On 7 March 2015, Sonatina in 7 and 5 was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of a programme aired on the eve of International Women's Day. Her music is influenced by phenomena ranging from the wedding chant of Masai warriors to passages from scripture." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Henry Ned Miller (April 12, 1925 â€“ March 18, 2016) was an American country music singer-songwriter. Active as a recording artist from 1956 to 1970, he is known primarily for his hit single \"From a Jack to a King\", a crossover hit in 1962 which reached Top 10 on the country music, adult contemporary, and Billboard Hot 100 charts, as well as reaching No.2 in the UK charts. He had several more chart singles in his career, although none matched the success of \"From a Jack to a King\". He also composed and recorded \"Invisible Tears\"." ;

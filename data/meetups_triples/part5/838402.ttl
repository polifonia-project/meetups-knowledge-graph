        mtp:hasAbstract        "Darren Michael Jessee is an American drummer and singer-songwriter best known as a member of the alternative rock trio Ben Folds Five. Jessee has also worked as an instrumentalist for Sharon Van Etten and Hiss Golden Messenger and released two solo albums and four albums as singer and songwriter for indie band Hotel Lights. His first solo album, The Jane, Room 217, was released on August 24th, 2018, to near-universal acclaim from critics. Jessee formed indie band Hotel Lights in 2004, with whom he has recorded 4 studio albums and an extended play. Ben Folds, on an iTunes Originals compilation, credited the Jessee-penned chorus for \"Brick\" as the missing element to a song that he had tried to compose for a long time. Darren can also be heard drumming on the song \"Strangest Thing\" from The War on Drugs' 2017 album A Deeper Understanding, Hiss Golden Messenger's Hallelujah Anyhow (2017), and Josh Rouse's album Under Cold Blue Stars, released in 2002." ;

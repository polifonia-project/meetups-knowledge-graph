Known primarily for his parodies of popular country songs, he has been called the \"Weird Al\" Yankovic of country music, and his albums are usually an equal mix of original comedy songs and parodies. Judd has released 11 studio albums and two EPs, and several singles have entered the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. His highest chart peak is the number-48 \"I Love NASCAR\", a parody of Toby Keith's 2003 single \"I Love This Bar\"." ;

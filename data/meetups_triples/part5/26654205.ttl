        mtp:hasAbstract        "Lia Clark, the stage name of Rhael Lima de Oliveira (born February 15, 1992), is a Brazilian singer and drag queen. Born in Santos, São Paulo, Rhael grew up listening to Brazilian funk. Inspired by Valesca Popozuda and Tati Quebra-Barraco, in 2014, Rhael became the drag queen \"Lia Clark\", working as DJ known to play funk. Two years later, the artist came to prominence as a singer after the release of \"Trava Trava\". A hit on Spotify and YouTube, it led to a national tour and to the release of the extended play (EP) Clark Boom in 2016. In the following year, the EP spawned hits like \"Chifrudo\", \"TOME CUrtindo\" and \"Boquetáxi\". The first two marked collaborations with trans singer and drag queen Pabllo Vittar respectively, while the latter was involved in a controversy when her YouTube video was restricted because of alleged improper sexual content. During 2018, Clark's singles \"Tipo de Garota\", \"Q.M.T.\" and \"Bumbum no Ar\" anticipated the release of the album, É da Pista. The latter song gained notoriety because of the partnership with Wanessa Camargo and its politically motivated music video." ;

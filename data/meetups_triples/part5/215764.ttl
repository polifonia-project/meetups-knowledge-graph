        mtp:hasAbstract        "Shawntae Harris-Dupart (born April 14, 1974), better known by her stage name Da Brat, is an American rapper. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, she began her career in 1992, the year she signed with So So Def Records. Her debut album Funkdafied (1994) sold one million copies, making her the first female solo rap act to receive a platinum certification, and the second overall female rap act (solo or group) after Salt-N-Pepa. Throughout her career, she has earned two top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100, \"Funkdafied\" and \"Not Tonight\", the latter with Lil' Kim, Lisa Lopes, Missy Elliott and Angie Martinez. Brat has also had commercial success with other songs including \"I Think They Like Me\", plus several remixes of Mariah Carey's songs, including \"Loverboy\", \"Always Be My Baby\", \"I Still Believe/Pure Imagination\", \"Honey\", and \"Gotta Thing For You\", a hip-hop-inspired version of the Bobby Caldwell song \"What You Wonâ€™t Do For Love\". Brat has received two Grammy Award nominations." ;

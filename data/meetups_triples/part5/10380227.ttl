        mtp:hasAbstract        "Bonnie Buckingham (March 25, 1923 â€“ January 13, 2019), better known as Bonnie Guitar, was an American singer, musician, producer, and businesswoman. She was best known for her 1957 country-pop crossover hit \"Dark Moon\". She became one of the first female country music singers to have hit songs cross over from the country charts to the pop charts. She co-founded the record company Dolton Records in the late 1950s, that launched the careers of The Fleetwoods and The Ventures. In 1960, she left Dolton and became part owner of Jerden Records." ;

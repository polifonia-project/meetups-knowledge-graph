She released her debut single, \"Dreams\", in 1993, and it topped the UK Singles Chart the same year. Her other singles include \"Going Nowhere\", \"Give Me a Little More Time\", \"Walk On By\", and \"If You Ever\" â€” a duet with East 17. After a few quiescent years, Gabrielle made a comeback with \"Rise\", which became her second UK number one, in 2000.

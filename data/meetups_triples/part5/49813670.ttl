He performed in local bars since age 15, and was mentored by Barry Williams, who is Jason Aldean's father. He gained popularity by singing cover versions of popular country music songs, amassing more than 3.7 million viewers on YouTube as a result. One of the artists who discovered his videos was Justin Moore, who chose him to perform on the \"Off the Beaten Path\" tour. Rager was signed to Broken Bow Records in 2014. Rager released his debut single, \"Southern Boy\", via Broken Bow in February 2016. The song, which features Aldean on duet vocals, was written by Luke Laird, Barry Dean, Jeremy Stover, and Jaron Boyer, with Stover also serving as producer.

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Donald Maynard Dokken (born June 29, 1953) is an American singer and musician. He's best known for being the lead singer, occasional guitarist, and founder of the glam metal band Dokken. He is known for his vibrato-laden, melodic vocal style which has made him an influential figure in American heavy metal/glam metal. After enjoying mainstream success with Dokken, he parted ways with the band in 1988 and pursued a solo career. His 1990 solo album, Up from the Ashes, spawned two singles and achieved modest success. He released his second solo album, titled Solitary, in 2008, which was a stylistic departure from his Dokken material. Don reformed Dokken in the early 1990s and has been continuing on with the band ever since. He is the only remaining original member of Dokken." ;

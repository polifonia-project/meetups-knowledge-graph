        mtp:hasAbstract        "David Michael Navarro (born June 7, 1967) is an American guitarist. He is best known as a member of the rock band Jane's Addiction, with whom he has recorded four studio albums. Between 1993 and 1998, Navarro was the guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, recording one studio album, One Hot Minute (1995), before departing. He has also released one solo album, Trust No One (2001). Navarro has also been a member of Jane's Addiction-related bands Deconstruction and the Panic Channel. AllMusic's Greg Prato described Navarro as \"one of alternative rock's first true guitar heroes\", with an eclectic playing style that merges heavy metal, psychedelia, and modern rock.\"He's one of the last great guitarists,\" said Henry Rollins, former Black Flag singer, who saw him playing with Jane's Addiction. Navarro was also the host and one of the judges on Ink Master, an American tattoo competition reality series that aired on Paramount Network (formerly called Spike) from 2012 to 2020." ;

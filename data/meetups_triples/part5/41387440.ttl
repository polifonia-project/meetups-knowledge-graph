        mtp:hasAbstract        "Wally Palmar (born Volodymyr Palamarchuk; April 27, 1954 in Hamtramck, Michigan) is a Ukrainian-American musician, singer, songwriter and composer. He is best known as a founding member and lead singer of The Romantics, a rock band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1977. Palmar was born in Hamtramck, Michigan, US to Ukrainian immigrant parents in 1954 and immediately took to the sounds of the British Invasion. Palmar and several high school friends formed the Romantics in 1977 scoring their first record deal in 1979 with Nemperor Records. Their self-titled debut album for Nemperor in 1980 with British producer Pete Solley contained the band's first chart hit. \"What I Like About You\", which Palmar co-wrote, peaked at #49 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band's 1983 album, In Heat contained the band's biggest hit, the million-selling \"Talking in Your Sleep\". In early 1984, it spent several weeks at #3 on Billboard and featured Palmar on lead vocals. Palmar also provided lead vocals on the minor-hit follow-up single, \"One in a Million\". In 2010 and 2011, Palmar toured as a part of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band performing \"What I Like About You\" and \"Talking in Your Sleep\". In 2014, Palmar was a founding member of the Empty Hearts. The group recorded on 429 Records and Palmar's bandmates included Blondie drummer Clem Burke, the Chesterfield Kings bassist Andy Babiuk, the Cars guitarist Elliot Easton, and Small Faces and Faces pianist Ian McLagan. The band's self-titled first album was released 5 August 2014 and produced by Ed Stasium." ;

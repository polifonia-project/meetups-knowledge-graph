Nicknamed the Red Elvis, Reed was the best-selling Western performer in Communist countries, with his songs often topping the local charts, and millions of his records were sold in the Eastern bloc and elsewhere mostly under the Melodiya label. He never renounced his U.S. citizenship, despite often denouncing the U.S. government, and was seen by the Western media as a Communist propaganda beacon." ;

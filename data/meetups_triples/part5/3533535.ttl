        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brenda Mae Tarpley (born December 11, 1944), known professionally as Brenda Lee, is an American singer. Performing rockabilly, pop and country music, she had 47 US chart hits during the 1960s and is ranked fourth in that decade, surpassed only by Elvis Presley, the Beatles and Ray Charles. She is known for her 1960 hit \"I'm Sorry\" and 1958's \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\", which has become a Christmas standard. At 4 ft 9 inches tall (approximately 145 cm), she received the nickname \"Little Miss Dynamite\" in 1957, after recording the song \"Dynamite\" when she was 12, and was one of the earliest pop stars to have a major contemporary international following. In 1969, Lee returned to the charts with her recording \"Johnny One Time\" penned by A. L. \"Doodle\" Owens and Dallas Frazier. The song reached #3 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Chart and #41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also earned Lee her second Grammy nomination for Best Pop Female Vocal. Later success came with a return to her roots as a country singer, with a string of hits through the 1970s and 1980s. Lee has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. She is a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Rockabilly Halls of Fame. She is also a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award recipient. Lee is the first woman to be inducted into both the Rock and Roll and Country Music Halls of Fame." ;

Scott started out as the band's bassist, but switched to guitar after David \"Yorkie\" Palmer joined in 1997, partly so that he could concentrate on vocals. Prior to Space, he has played in various Liverpool bands, such as the Substitutes (with Jamie Murphy), Hello Sunset and the Australians (with Franny Griffiths, who later became Space's keyboardist). Following Space's original breakup in 2005, Scott formed The Drellas, which in 2011 morphed into the current line-up of Space after Griffiths rejoined the band. On 22 November 2020, Scott released his debut solo album Marionette under the moniker The Thomas Scott Quintet." ;

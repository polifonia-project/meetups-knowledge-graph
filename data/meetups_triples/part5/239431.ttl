        mtp:hasAbstract        "Susan Kay Quatro (born June 3, 1950) is an American singer, bass guitarist, songwriter, and actress. In the 1970s, she scored a string of hit singles that found greater success in Europe and Australia than in her homeland, reaching No. 1 in the UK, other European countries and Australia with her singles \"Can the Can\" (1973) and \"Devil Gate Drive\" (1974). Quatro released her self-titled debut album in 1973. Since then, she has released fifteen studio albums, ten compilation albums, and one live album. Her other solo hits include \"48 Crash\", \"Daytona Demon\", \"The Wild One\", and \"Your Mama Won't Like Me\". Following a recurring role as bass player Leather Tuscadero on the popular American sitcom Happy Days, her duet \"Stumblin' In\" with Smokie's lead singer Chris Norman reached No. 4 in the US. Between 1973 and 1980, Quatro was awarded six Bravo Ottos. In 2010, she was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame. She is reported to have sold over 50 million records worldwide, and continues to perform live. Quatro's most recent studio album, The Devil in Me, was released in 2021 and saw the collaboration of her son Richard Tuckey who had already taken part in No Control in 2019. Quatro also remains active in radio broadcasting." ;

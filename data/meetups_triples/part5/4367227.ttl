        mtp:hasAbstract        "Roger Frederick Cook (born 19 August 1940) is an English singer, songwriter and record producer, who has written many hit records for other recording artists. He has also had a successful recording career in his own right. He is best known for his collaborations with Roger Greenaway. Cook's co-compositions have included \"You've Got Your Troubles\", and the transatlantic million selling songs, \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\" and \"Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress\". They were the first UK songwriting partnership to win an Ivor Novello Award as 'Songwriters of the Year' in two successive years. In 1997, Cook became the first and so far only British songwriter to enter the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame." ;

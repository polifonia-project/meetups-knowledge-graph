        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Dean Taylor (May 11, 1939 â€“ January 7, 2022) was a Canadian musician, most notable as a singer, songwriter, and record producer for Motown during the 1960s and 1970s. According to Jason Ankeny, Taylor was \"one of the most underrated acts ever to record under the Motown aegis.\" As a singer, American audiences know Taylor best for his chart-topping 1970 hit \"Indiana Wants Me\", which hit No. 1 in Cash Box in the United States and was also No. 2 in Canada and No. 2 in the UK. It peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. He became well known in the United Kingdom for other hits, including \"Gotta See Jane\" and \"There's a Ghost in My House\"." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Joaquín Ramón Martínez Sabina (born 12 February 1949) is a Spanish musician, singer, composer, and poet. His songs usually treat about love, heartbreaks and society with a large usage of literary figures similarly to the baroque-literature style. He has released fourteen studio albums, two live albums, and three compilation albums. Some of his most known songs are \"Calle Melancolía\" (\"Melancholia street\"), \"19 días y 500 noches\" (\"19 days and 500 nights\"),\"Quién me ha robado el mes de Abril\" (\"Who stole my April month\"), \"Pongamos que hablo de Madrid\" (\"Lets say I'm talking about Madrid\"), \"Y sin embargo\" (\"However\"), \"Contigo\" (\"With you\") or \"Peces de ciudad\" (\"City fish\") He performed both solo and with a group for his live albums, performing with Javier Krahe and Alberto Pérez in La mandrágora, the group Viceversa in a 1986 concert, and with Joan Manuel Serrat in Dos pájaros de un tiro (Two birds with one stone). Sabina suffered a stroke in 2001 and although he physically recovered, he entered a deep depression which resulted in a four-year-long concert hiatus. He recovered and released his eighteenth album, Alivio de Luto, in November 2005 and in 2009 he released his album, Vinagre y rosas. In 2012 he released his latest album in collaboration with Joan Manuel Serrat: La Orquesta Del Titanic. On June 29, 2020, Sabina married Jimena Coronado in a private ceremony in Madrid" ;

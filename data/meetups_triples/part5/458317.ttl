For over forty years he has been releasing albums on labels in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. In his lyrics and his other writing he makes use of continental philosophy, and has built up a personal world he says is \"dominated by values like diversity, orientalism, and a respect for otherness\"." ;

In 2006, Svantes viser was selected for the Danish Culture Canon. Povl Dissing grew up in Stavnsholt, a small village near Farum north of Copenhagen, and was educated commercial artist from which he made a living before turning to music full time. Originally he played the trumpet and jazz music, but an injuring accident in his early youth made him take up the guitar instead. He sang almost exclusively in Danish and played and worked with many other notable Danish musicians. He died on 18 July 2022 at the age of 84." ;

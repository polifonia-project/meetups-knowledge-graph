        mtp:hasAbstract        "Goldie Boutilier (born Kristin Kathleen Boutilier, July 31, 1988), known previously by her stage names My Name Is Kay, Kay, and Goldilox, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, model and DJ. Born and raised in Reserve Mines, Nova Scotia, Boutilier moved to Los Angeles at the age of 20 to pursue a music career. After being discovered by OneRepublic member Ryan Tedder, Boutilier signed a recording contract with Interscope Records under the alias My Name Is Kay (later shortened to just Kay), and released her self-titled debut EP, My Name Is Kay, in 2011. Following a string of successful features with TiÃ«sto and Steve Aoki, Boutilier released her debut album, My Name Is Kay in 2013. After dealing with tensions with her label, Boutilier split with Universal sometime in 2015. Boutilier then moved to Paris, France and began DJing under the name Goldilox. She released second album, Very Best, in 2018 independently under the name Goldilox. In 2020, she changed her stage name to Goldie Boutilier. Boutilier is a successful model, appearing in campaigns for Diesel Black Gold, H&M, John Galliano, Casablanca and Luisaviaroma. She is currently represented by VIVA Model Management in Europe." ;

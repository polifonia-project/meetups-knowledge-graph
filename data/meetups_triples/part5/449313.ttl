She was one of the greatest actresses of the Hindi cinema and a leading lady in Hindi language films in the 1940s and 1950s. She was also a renowned playback singer, who mostly sang for herself, starting from a song in Nai Duniya (1942) when she was only 12 years old. She was known for her North Indian Muslim feudal style acting or adakari in many of her films. Suraiya made her first appearance as a child artist with the film Madame Fashion (1936), directed by Jaddan Bai.

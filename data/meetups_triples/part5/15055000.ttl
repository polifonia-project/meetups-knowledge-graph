        mtp:hasAbstract        "Leonard George DeStoppelaire (January 5, 1923 â€“ February 12, 2006), better known as Lenny Dee, was an American virtuoso organist who played many styles of music. His record albums were among the most popular of easy listening and space age pop organists of the 1950s through the early 1970s. His signature hit, \"Plantation Boogie\", charted as a Top 20 hit in 1955. He also had a gold record with 1970's Spinning Wheel. Dee played a variety of songs in numerous styles. He played original compositions, popular songs, and novelty tunes, and was a master of improvisation. Although his unique style was a pop/boogie-woogie blend, he also played ballads, country and western, jazz, rock, and patriotic songs." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "James Timothy Hardin (December 23, 1941 â€“ December 29, 1980) was an American folk and blues musician and composer. As well as releasing his own material, several of his songs, including \"If I Were a Carpenter\" and \"Reason to Believe\", became hits for other artists. Hardin grew up in Oregon and joined the Marine Corps. He started his music career in Greenwich Village which led to recording several albums in the mid- to late 1960s, and a performance at the Woodstock Festival. Hardin struggled with drug abuse throughout most of his adult life, and live performances were sometimes erratic. He was planning a comeback when he died in late 1980 from a heroin overdose." ;

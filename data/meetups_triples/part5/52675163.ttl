        mtp:hasAbstract        "Navraj Singh Goraya (born November 3, 1989), known professionally as Nav (stylized in all caps), is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He began his career as a producer, co-producing fellow Canadian rapper Drake's single \"Back to Back\" in 2015. He then gained mainstream attention in 2016 when his song \"Myself\" went viral. Nav is signed to the Weeknd's record label XO Records and Republic Records, and is managed by label managers Amir \"Cash\" Esmailian and Wassim \"Sal\" Slaiby. Nav released his self-titled debut mixtape, as well as his collaborative mixtape, Perfect Timing, with American record producer Metro Boomin, in 2017. Nav released his debut studio album, Reckless, in 2018. He then released his second studio album, Bad Habits (2019), which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. In 2020, Nav released his highest-charting song as a lead artist, \"Turks\", with Gunna featuring Travis Scott, which debuted and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. It serves as the lead single to his third studio album, Good Intentions (2020), which was released later and then became his second number-one album on the US Billboard 200. Soon, he released its deluxe edition titled Brown Boy 2 (2020), which is also a sequel of his unofficial EP titled Brown Boy (2019), which Cash published on Audiomack a week before Bad Habits. He then earned his highest-charting song in total from his feature alongside Don Toliver and Gunna on record label Internet Money single \"Lemonade\", which eventually peaked at number 6 on the Hot 100. He released the commercial mixtape Emergency Tsunami in November 2020, which debuted at number six on the US Billboard 200 chart." ;

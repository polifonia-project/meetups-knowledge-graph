        mtp:hasAbstract        "Hamid Cheriet (Kabyle: Ḥamid Ceryat; 25 October 1949 – 2 May 2020), better known by his stage name Idir, was an Algerian Kabyle singer-songwriter and musician. Referred to as the \"King of Amazigh music\", he is regarded as one of the more significant modern day figures in Algerian and Amazigh culture, history, and struggle. Along with musicians like Ferhat Mehenni and Lounis Aït Menguellet, Idir helped popularize Raï folk music. Initially training to be a geologist, his interest for music was piqued when he was called to sing on state radio as a late substitute. After finishing his compulsory military service, he moved to France in 1975 and embarked on his career in music. Idir took a hiatus during the 1980s before returning in 1993. He was a passionate advocate of the Kabyle and Berber cultures." ;

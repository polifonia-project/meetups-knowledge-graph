        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jonah Kirsten Sorrentino (born June 26, 1975), better known by his stage name KJ-52, is a Christian rapper from Tampa, Florida. The \"KJ\" part of his name refers to his old rap alias, \"King J. Mac,\" a name which he later described in one of his podcasts as \"horribly cheesy.\" \"52\", which is pronounced \"five two\", not \"fifty-two\", is a reference to the Biblical story of Jesus feeding the multitude with five loaves and two fish, which is also sung about in his song \"Push Up\" from The Yearbook and in the \"KJ Five Two\" on It's Pronounced 'Five Two. He was awarded the Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year for \"Never Look Away\" and Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year at the GMA Dove Awards of 2007. On July 28, 2009, KJ-52 released \"End of My Rope\", which is the first single for his album Five-Two Television." ;

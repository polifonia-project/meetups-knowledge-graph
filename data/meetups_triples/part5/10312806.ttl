She is also one of the first artists to gain crossover success from country music to rock and roll. She was the \"top name\" on the first country music program regularly broadcast on a national TV network. Bonnie Lou was one of the first female co-hosts of a successful syndicated television talk show, and a regular musical performer on popular shows in the 1960s and 1970s. She \"was a prime mover in the first days of rockabilly,\" and is a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Richard Anthony \"Cheech\" Marin (born July 13, 1946) is an American actor, musician, comedian, and activist who gained recognition as part of the comedy act Cheech & Chong during the 1970s and early 1980s with Tommy Chong and as Don Johnson's partner, Insp. Joe Dominguez, on Nash Bridges. He has also voiced characters in several Disney films, including Oliver & Company, The Lion King, the Cars series, Coco and Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Marin's trademark is his characters' strong Chicano accents, although Marin himself is not fluent in Spanish." ;

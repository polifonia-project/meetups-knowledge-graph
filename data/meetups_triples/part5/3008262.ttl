        mtp:hasAbstract        "Katie Lee (October 23, 1919 â€“ November 1, 2017) was an American folk singer, actress, writer, photographer and environmental activist. From the 1950s, Lee often sang about rivers and white water rafting. She was a vocal opponent of Glen Canyon Dam, which closed its gates in 1963, and called for the canyon to be returned to its natural state; for her environmental activism, was often called \"the Desert Goddess of Glen Canyon.\" Her obituary in The New York Times states, \"Ms. Lee never forgave the builders of the Glen Canyon Dam and said the only thing that prevented her from blowing it up was that she did not know how.\"" ;

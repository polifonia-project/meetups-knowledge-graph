He is the former bassist of the heavy metal group Accept, having played bass guitar on their first 15 albums. He joined them in 1976 after Dieter Rubach left the band and also made minor contributions as a lead vocalist with Accept on their early albums and on the album Predator of 1996. After 42 years as a member, Baltes announced his departure from Accept in November 2018; the band later replaced him with former Uli Jon Roth sideman Martin Motnik." ;

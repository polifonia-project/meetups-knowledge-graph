        mtp:hasAbstract        "Willie Junior Maxwell II (born June 7, 1991), better known by his stage name Fetty Wap, is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. He rose to prominence after his debut single \"Trap Queen\" reached number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in May 2015. This helped Fetty Wap secure a record deal with 300 Entertainment. The single was followed up with two top 10 hits in the U.S., \"679\" (featuring Remy Boyz) and \"My Way\" (remixed featuring Drake). All three songs were featured on Fetty Wap's eponymous debut album, released in September 2015, which peaked atop the U.S. Billboard 200 chart." ;

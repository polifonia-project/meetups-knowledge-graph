        mtp:hasAbstract        "Anthony Paul Rombola (born November 24, 1964) is an American musician who has been the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the Boston-based rock band Godsmack since the mid-1990s. Rombola has been cited as \"an extraodinaire\" in the guitar world by Guitar World magazine, and is cited to be the only guitarist to keep an \"original soloing style\" during the nu metal period, earning him the respect of the guitar industry. Rombola is also a guitarist for the side-project band Another Animal, formed at the beginning of 2007. The band released their self-titled debut album in October 2007 and played shows, whilst frontman Sully Erna did a small solo tour." ;

Holober moved to New York in 1986, and worked as a composer and sideman pianist. After working with baritone saxophonist Nick Brignola in the late 1990s, he formed The Mike Holober Quintet, featuring original compositions and arrangements performed by Tim Ries (saxophone), Wolfgang Muthspiel (guitar), Brian Blade (drums), and Scott Colley and John Patitucci (bass). The quintet recorded two albums on Sons of Sound: Canyon (2003) and Wish List(2006). Holober's big band, The Gotham Jazz Orchestra, released two recordings: thought Trains (Sons of Sound, 2004) and Quake (Sunnyside, 2009). The group's most recent recording, Hiding Out, is due for release August 2019 on ZOHO. The double CD features Hiding Out, commissioned for by The Philadelphia Museum of Art (funded by the Pew Foundation), Flow, commissioned by the Westchester Jazz Orchestra (funded by a NYSCA Individual Artist’s Grant), and Jumble, commissioned by The U.S. Army Jazz Knights of West Point. The recording also includes an arrangement of Jobim’s Caminhos Cruzados, commissioned by the Westchester Jazz Orchestra and written for and featuring trumpet master Marvin Stamm. Other featured artists on Hiding Out include Billy Drewes, Jason Rigby, Scott Wendholt, Adam Kolker, Jon Gordon, Steve Cardenas, and Jesse Lewis. Holober is a 2017-18 recipient of a Chamber Music America New Jazz Works Grant for Don’t Let Go, a song-cycle in the tradition of Robert Schumann, Samuel Barber, and Ralph Vaughn-Williams, and premiered at Symphony Space (The Leonard Nimoy Thalia) in June 2018. Don’t Let Go was written for Holober's octet Balancing Act, whose premiere recording Balancing Act was released in 2015 (Palmetto), featuring Mike’s original compositions (several with lyrics), performed by Kate McGarry, Dick Oatts, Jason Rigby, Marvin Stamm, , John Hebert, and Brian Blade. Holober was the musical director of the Westchester Jazz Orchestra from 2007 to 2013, a non-profit organization based in Westchester New York.

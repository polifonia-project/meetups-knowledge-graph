        mtp:hasAbstract        "Eric Charles \"Erock\" Friedman (born June 28, 1984) is an American musician, best known as the current guitarist for Tremonti and former touring guitarist and backing vocalist for Creed. He played with the band on their 2009 United States reunion tour with Staind and their 2010 Tour with Skillet. He is the former lead guitarist for the band Submersed and also the former lead guitarist for Daughters of Mara. Submersed and Daughters of Mara both disbanded in 2008. He also currently plays lead guitar and co writes for the rock band Hemme. At the age of thirteen Friedman was the youngest guitarist at the time to be fully endorsed by Fender. His first introduction to Mark Tremonti was at a NAMM show where his then manager introduced them both. They subsequently jammed at one of the Rivera amp booths and noticed, that although they had different styles, (Tremonti being heavily influenced by metal and Friedman Blues), they both complemented each other." ;

He was the 1991 founder of Kalan Müzik, a Turkish independent record label company based in Istanbul specialized in releasing Saltık's recordings of traditional ethnic and folk music from Turkey and vicinity, sometimes against governmental opposition. In 2003, Saltık's work through Kalan made him a laureate of the international Prince Claus Awards on the theme \"The survival and innovation of Crafts\" for having \"played a central role in the rescue, rediscovery and documentation of the cultural diversity of Turkish music\". In 2004, he was called \"The Anthropologist of Folk Music\" by Time magazine." ;

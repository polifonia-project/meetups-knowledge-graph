        mtp:hasAbstract        "Zhou Xiaoyan (Chinese: 周小燕; Wade–Giles: Chou Hsiao-yen; August 17, 1917 – March 4, 2016) was a Chinese vocal pedagogue and classical soprano. Dubbed by The New York Times as \"China's First Lady of Opera\", she was considered to be the first important instructor of Western opera in China. As a vocalist, she performed in theaters and concert halls across Europe in 1946–1947; earning the nickname the \"Chinese Nightingale\". Under the directive of Premier Zhou Enlai, she began a career teaching voice at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 1949. She remained an instructor at the Shanghai Conservatory for more than 65 years. Many of her students went on to highly successful international opera careers." ;

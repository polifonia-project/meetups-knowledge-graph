        mtp:hasAbstract        "Brock Peters (born George Fisher; July 2, 1927 â€“ August 23, 2005) was an American actor and singer, best known for playing the villainous \"Crown\" in the 1959 film version of Porgy and Bess, and the wrongfully convicted Tom Robinson in the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird. He was nominated for a Tony Award and won a Drama Desk Award and an Outer Critics Circle Award for his lead performance as Rev. Stephen Kumalo in the 1972 Broadway revival of Lost in the Stars. His film roles also included The Pawnbroker (1964), Soylent Green (1973) and Ghosts of Mississippi (1996). In the 1980s and 1990s, he voiced the role of Darth Vader in the serial radio drama adaptations of the original trilogy of Star Wars films, and played two recurring roles in the Star Trek franchise: Starfleet Admiral Cartwright in two of the original-cast feature films, and Joseph Sisko (father of station commander Benjamin Sisko) in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine." ;

Malfatti is associated with the style of music known as reductionism and has been described as \"among the leaders in redefining the avant-garde as truly on-the-edge art.\" His work \"since the early nineties... has been investigating the edges of ultraminimalism in both his composed and improvised work.\" He also operates B-Boim, a CD-R-only record label focusing on improvised and composed music, much of it his own." ;

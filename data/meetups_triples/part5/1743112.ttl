        mtp:hasAbstract        "Alan Earle O'Day (October 3, 1940 â€“ May 17, 2013) was an American singer-songwriter, best known for writing and singing \"Undercover Angel,\" a million-selling Gold-certified American No. 1 hit in 1977. He also wrote songs for many other notable performers, such as 1974's Helen Reddy No. 1 hit \"Angie Baby\" and the Righteous Brothers' No. 3 Gold hit \"Rock and Roll Heaven\". In the 1980s he moved from pop music to television, co-writing nearly 100 songs for the Saturday morning Muppet Babies series, and in the 1990s he wrote and performed music on the National Geographic series Really Wild Animals. O'Day also collaborated with Tatsuro Yamashita on a series of popular songs in Japan including \"Your Eyes\", \"Magic Ways\", \"Christmas Eve\" and \"Fragile\" (which Tyler the Creator interpolated in \"Gone, Gone/Thank You\")." ;

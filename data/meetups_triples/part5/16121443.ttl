Billboard presented her in 2022, saying: \"Spanning punk rock, hip-hop, and dance music, Santigold’s singular pen and voice have helped shape the past two decades of popular music\". Her debut studio album, Santogold (2008), received widespread critical acclaim for its cross-genre combining dub, new wave, and hip-hop. The album's second single \"L.E.S. Artistes\", reached the top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. Her second album, Master of My Make-Believe (2012), peaked at number one on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart. The album included \"Disparate Youth\", her highest-charting single to date. She released her third album, 99¢, in 2016, and her second mixtape, I Don't Want: The Gold Fire Sessions, in 2018. Her fourth studio album Spirituals, including the singles \"High Priestess\" and \"Ain't Ready\", was released in September 2022. Spirituals received favorable reviews, The Guardian describing it as a \"whirlwind album full of feeling and fervour\". Additionally, Santigold has collaborated with artists such as Beastie Boys, David Byrne, Mark Ronson, Karen O, Jay-Z and Kanye West. Her awards include \"Best Breakthrough Artist\" at the 2008 NME Awards, and the \"Vanguard award\" at 2009 ASCAP Awards." ;

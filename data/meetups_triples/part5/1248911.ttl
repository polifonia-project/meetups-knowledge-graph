        mtp:hasAbstract        "Giuseppe Di Stefano (24 July 1921 – 3 March 2008) was an Italian operatic tenor who sang professionally from the mid-1940s until the early 1990s. Called Pippo by both fans and friends, he was known as the \"Golden voice\" or \"The most beautiful voice\", as the true successor of Beniamino Gigli.Luciano Pavarotti said he modeled himself after Di Stefano. In an interview Pavarotti said \"Di Stefano is my idol. There is a solar voice...It was the most incredible, open voice you could hear. The musicality of Di Stefano is as natural and beautiful as the voice is phenomenal\". Di Stefano was also the tenor who most inspired José Carreras. He died on 3 March 2008 as a result of injuries from an attack by unknown assailants." ;

        mtp:hasAbstract        "Phillip Krokidis (6 May 1969 â€“ 1 November 2020), known professionally as Phil K, was an Australian electronic music DJ and record producer from Melbourne. He was a member of the \"Aussie breaks\" music scene which also includes other Melbourne DJs such as Nubreed and Andy Page. In addition to DJing, Phil K also produced alongside Habersham and Dave Preston in The Operators and was also a member of Hi-Fi Bugs and Lostep. He was known primarily for his DJing of breakbeat music, but often weaved in other genres such as ambient, deep house, and techno and did not pigeonhole himself with a particular genre." ;

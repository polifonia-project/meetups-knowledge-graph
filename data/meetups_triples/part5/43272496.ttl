        mtp:hasAbstract        "Meghan Elizabeth Trainor (born December 22, 1993) is an American singer-songwriter and television personality. She rose to prominence after signing with Epic Records in 2014 and releasing her debut single \"All About That Bass\", which reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and sold 11 million copies worldwide. Trainor has released five studio albums with the label and has received various accolades, including the 2016 Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Trainor became interested in music at a young age; she wrote, recorded, and produced three independently released acoustic albums, Meghan Trainor (2009), I'll Sing with You, and Only 17 (2010). She began writing and producing songs for other artists in 2013. In 2015, Trainor released her pop and hip hop major-label debut studio album, Title, which included the top-10 singles \"Lips Are Movin\" and \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\"; it debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. The single \"No\" led her follow-up album, the R&B album Thank You (2016), both of which reached number three on the respective charts. Trainor created her third album with Epic, the electronic dance music-influenced Treat Myself (2020), as an attempt to adapt to ongoing musical trends. She followed this with the holiday album A Very Trainor Christmas later that year. Trainor's fifth studio album, Takin' It Back, was released on October 21, 2022. \"Made You Look\", the first single off the album, reached the top 5 in many countries including the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Trainor's lyrics frequently include themes of womanhood, body image, and personal empowerment, though they have at times been criticized as antifeminist or regressive. Her music is influenced by the popular music of the 1950s, and blends the genres pop, R&B, doo-wop and blue-eyed soul. Outside of the music industry, she has had voice roles in the animated films Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017) and Playmobil: The Movie (2019). She served as a judge on the television talent shows The Four: Battle for Stardom (2018), The Voice UK (2020) and Australian Idol (2023). Trainor's accolades include a Grammy Award, four ASCAP Pop Music Awards, and two Billboard Music Awards." ;

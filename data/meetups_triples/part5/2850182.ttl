        mtp:hasAbstract        "Jack Owen Ingram (born November 15, 1970) is an American country music artist formerly signed to Big Machine Records, an independent record label. He has released eleven studio albums, one extended play, six live albums, and 19 singles. Although active since 1992, Ingram did not reach the U.S. Country Top 40 until the release of his single \"Wherever You Are\" late-2005. A number one hit on the Billboard country charts, that song was also his first release for Big Machine and that label's first Number One hit. Ingram has sent six other songs into the country Top 40 with \"Love You\", \"Lips of an Angel\" (a cover version of a song by Hinder), \"Measure of a Man\", \"Maybe She'll Get Lonely\", \"That's a Man\", and \"Barefoot and Crazy\"." ;

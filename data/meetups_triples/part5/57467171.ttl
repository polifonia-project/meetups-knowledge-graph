His works are noted for integrating traditional orchestral arrangements with electronic music, and rock music. He is the son of film and theatre director Debesh Chattopadhyay, and dancer and actress Kastury Chattopadhyay. In 2017, at the age of 20, Shreyan Chattopadhyay began his career scoring for Pancham Baidik's play \"Machi\" (Arpita Ghosh's adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre's The Flies); his debut work on the background score of the play received critical acclaim. Since then, Chattopadhyay has gone on to compose the background score for several theatre productions in Kolkata." ;

Forrest is known for his first solo recording of \"Night Train\". It reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B chart in March 1952, and stayed at the top for seven weeks. \"Hey Mrs. Jones\" (No. 3 R&B) and \"Bolo Blues\" were his other hits. All were made for United Records, for which he recorded between 1951 and 1953; he recorded frequently as both a sideman and a bandleader." ;

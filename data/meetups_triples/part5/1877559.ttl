His CBC Television series Don Messer’s Jubilee (1959–69) featured Messer's down-east fiddle style and the \"old-time\" music of Don Messer and His Islanders, and was one of the most popular and enduring Canadian television programs of the 1960s. Messer was known as a shy fiddler, who preferred to have the other members of the band take the spotlight." ;

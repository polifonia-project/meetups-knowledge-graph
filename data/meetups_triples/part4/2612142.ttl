        mtp:hasAbstract        "Coleman Randolph Hawkins (November 21, 1904 – May 19, 1969), nicknamed \"Hawk\" and sometimes \"Bean\", was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument, as Joachim E. Berendt explained: \"there were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn\". Hawkins biographer John Chilton described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to Hawkins as \"mooing\" and \"rubbery belches.\" Hawkins cited as influences Happy Caldwell, Stump Evans, and Prince Robinson, although he was the first to tailor his method of improvisation to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet. Hawkins' virtuosic, arpeggiated approach to improvisation, with his characteristic rich, emotional, and vibrato-laden tonal style, was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included Chu Berry, Charlie Barnet, Tex Beneke, Ben Webster, Vido Musso, Herschel Evans, Buddy Tate, and Don Byas, and through them the later tenormen, Arnett Cobb, Illinois Jacquet, Flip Phillips, Ike Quebec, Al Sears, Paul Gonsalves, and Lucky Thompson. While Hawkins became known with swing music during the big band era, he had a role in the development of bebop in the 1940s. Fellow saxophonist Lester Young, known as the \"President of the Tenor Saxophone,\" commented, in a 1959 interview with The Jazz Review: \"As far as I'm concerned, I think Coleman Hawkins was the president, first, right? As far as myself, I think I'm the second one.\" Miles Davis once said: \"When I heard Hawk, I learned to play ballads.\"" ;

After 1966, Jones led his own trio, and later larger groups under the name The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine. His brothers Hank and Thad were also celebrated jazz musicians with whom he occasionally recorded. Elvin was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1995. In his The History of Jazz, jazz historian and critic Ted Gioia calls Jones \"one of the most influential drummers in the history of jazz.\" He was also named Number 23 on Rolling Stone Magazine's 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time." ;

As Steve Rochinski notes, \"Of all the guitarists to emerge in the first generation after Charlie Christian, Tal Farlow, more than any other, has been able to move beyond the rhythmic, melodic, and harmonic vocabulary associated with the early electric guitar master. Tal's incredible speed, long, weaving lines, rhythmic excitement, highly developed harmonic sense, and enormous reach (both physical and musical) have enabled him to create a style that clearly stands apart from the rest.\" Where guitarists of his day combined rhythmic chords with linear melodies, Farlow placed single notes together in clusters, varying between harmonically enriched tones. As music critic Stuart Nicholson put it, \"In terms of guitar prowess, it was the equivalent of Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute mile.\"" ;

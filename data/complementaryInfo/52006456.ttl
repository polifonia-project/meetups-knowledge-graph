Juster started out as a variety show performer, and for a period he ran the theater Edderkoppen. Characterised by his unusually tall, lanky figure and squeeky voice, his signature act was the monologue \"Mot normalt\". He also acted in several successful comedies on the big screen, notably Den forsvundne pølsemaker (1941), Det æ'kke te å tru (1942), En herre med bart (1942) and Fjols til fjells (1957). He was the uncle of another of Norway's most beloved comedians, the late Rolf Just Nilsen." ;

Her film appearances include Bedre enn sitt rykte (1955), (1957), Fjols til fjells (1957), Støv på hjernen (1959), and Millionær for en aften (1960). In the comedy Fjols til fjells she played the character \"Ruth Granberg,\" opposite Leif Juster as \"Poppe.\" Until 2002 Fjols til fjells was the fourth-most-viewed Norwegian film of all time. Her best known song recording is probably Lille Frøken Stang from 1955. She gave voice to the character \"Vips\" (Red Fraggle) in the Norwegian dub of Fraggle Rock." ;

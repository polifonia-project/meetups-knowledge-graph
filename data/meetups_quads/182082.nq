<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Santayana> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás, known in English as George Santayana (/ˌsæntiˈænə, -ˈɑːnə/; December 16, 1863 – September 26, 1952), was a Spanish and US-American philosopher, essayist, poet, and novelist. Born in Spain, Santayana was raised and educated in the US from the age of eight and identified himself as an American, although he always retained a valid Spanish passport. At the age of 48, Santayana left his position at Harvard and returned to Europe permanently. Santayana is popularly known for aphorisms, such as \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\", \"Only the dead have seen the end of war\", and the definition of beauty as \"pleasure objectified\". Although an atheist, he treasured the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview in which he was raised. Santayana was a broad-ranging cultural critic spanning many disciplines. He was profoundly influenced by Spinoza's life and thought; and, in many respects, was a devoted Spinozist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Santayana> .

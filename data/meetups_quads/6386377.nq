In late 2015, Hennessy took over rhythm guitar duties in fellow Chicago punk band Rise Against during their European tour. Rise Against frontman and vocalist guitarist Tim McIlrath had broken his hand and was unable to play guitar, forcing him to singing exclusively. Hennessy works at Atlas Studios in Chicago with Matt Allison. He co-wrote the Rise Against song \"Swing Life Away\" with McIlrath, and also played percussion on the Less Than Jake album, GNV FLA. Hennessy usually uses a Slingerland (1970s) drum kit, Zildjian cymbals, and Remo heads." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neil_Hennessy> .

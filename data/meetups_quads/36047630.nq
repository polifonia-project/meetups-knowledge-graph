He studied cello at the Royal College of Music later becoming professor of cello at the Royal Academy of Music – the start of a teaching career that was to span almost four decades before he retired in 1966 at the age of 75. During the inter-War years he became a prominent player of both chamber and orchestral music; his repertoire included both British and European contemporary music. He recorded for HMV and was broadcast by the BBC. He composed a number of original pieces mostly for solo cello with piano accompaniment." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cedric_Sharpe> .

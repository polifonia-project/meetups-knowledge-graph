<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Fuller_(director)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Christopher Elwin Fuller is an American film director, writer, producer, editor, actor and entrepreneur. His films have been compared to the early, avant-garde works of Gus Van Sant, Harmony Korine and Robert Bresson, though his peers consider him a rarity in that his films are entirely unique. In 2006, he released Loren Cass, which he wrote, directed, produced and starred in under the name Lewis Brogan. The film is set against the backdrop of the St. Petersburg, Florida riots of 1996. The film was written at the age of 15 and filmed in 2004 at the age of 21. The movie was released theatrically and on DVD in 2009 by Kino International. The film played in competition at Dennis Hopper's CineVegas Film Festival, the Filmmakers of the Present section of the Locarno International Film Festival and the Museum of Modern Art." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Fuller_(director)> .

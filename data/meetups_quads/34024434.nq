<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesy_Nelson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jessica Louise Nelson (born 14 June 1991) is an English singer who rose to prominence as a member of the girl group Little Mix from 2011 to 2020, one of the world's best-selling girl groups. With Little Mix, she released six studio albums and achieved five number-one singles on the UK Singles Chart. Nelson auditioned as a solo act for the eighth series of The X Factor, and successfully made it through to bootcamp stage, before being eliminated. Following her elimination, she was placed into a group with three other contestants to form the girl group Little Mix, making history by becoming the first group to win the British version of the series. Since leaving Little Mix, Nelson signed to American label Republic Records and was formerly signed to Polydor Records in 2021 but left a year later due to creative differences. In October 2021, she released her debut single \"Boyz\", featuring rapper Nicki Minaj, which debuted and peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesy_Nelson> .

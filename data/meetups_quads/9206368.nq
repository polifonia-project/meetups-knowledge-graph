In 2004 he was voted Instrumentalist of the Year in the Scots Trad Music awards. He has won a number of prizes in the solo Highland Bagpipes circuit. Morrison's tunes have become popular in the solo piping circuit and the folk scene. Notable are \"Passing Places\", respectively a lively hornpipe and a low whistle slow air inspired by train rides that Morrison made all over the UK, \"Living Uist\", \"The Lochaber Badger\" and the strathspey \"Seonaidh's Tune\" that he composed for his son.

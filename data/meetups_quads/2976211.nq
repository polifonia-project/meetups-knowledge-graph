<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louise_Wightman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Louise Fitzgerald Wightman (n√©e Johnson), also known as Lucy Wightman (born June 18, 1959 in Lake Forest, Illinois), is an American former exotic dancer who performed in Boston and Providence during the 1970s and 1980s, using the stage name Princess Cheyenne. The juxtaposition of her education and class background with her career attracted media attention. In the spring of 2007, she again attracted public interest, this time for being convicted of being a practicing psychologist without a license in two South Shore Massachusetts communities. Since then she has worked as a writer, photographer, and blogger." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louise_Wightman> .

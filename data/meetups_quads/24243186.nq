He is known for creating songs that became hits for other artists. His best-known song is \"Tulsa Time\" recorded by Don Williams which became the number one U.S. Billboard country song of 1979. It was later recorded by Eric Clapton to reach number 30 on Billboard pop charts. Flowers' other songs written for Don Williams include \"Back in My Younger Days\", \"Se√±orita\", and \"To Be Your Man\". He co-wrote \"Gulf Coast Highway\", recorded by Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, and Nanci Griffith. Emmylou Harris' 1975 album, Pieces of the Sky derives its title from a Flowers lyric in his included song, \"Before Believing\". His music has roots in the blues genre. His skill as a session musician guitarist distinguishes him from most of Nashville's other songwriters." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Danny_Flowers> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peggy_Mount> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Margaret Rose Mount OBE (2 May 1915 â€“ 13 November 2001) was an English actress. As a child, she found acting an escape from an unhappy home life. After playing in amateur productions, she was taken on by a repertory company and spent nine years in various British towns, learning her craft. In 1955, she got her big break in the comic play Sailor Beware!: she created the leading role in a repertory production and, though unknown to London audiences, was given the part when the play was presented in the West End. She became known for playing domineering middle-aged women in plays, films and television shows. Mount occasionally performed in comedies from the classical repertoire, including works by Shakespeare, Jonson, Goldsmith and Sheridan, and she was a member of The Old Vic, National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare companies in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, respectively. Later in her career, Mount was cast more frequently in serious parts, including the title role of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage on stage, and in several television dramas. She retired after going blind and spent her last years in the actors' retirement home, Denville Hall, in northwest London. Her biography Everything I Ever Wanted, by Andrew Ross, was published in 2019 by Fantom Films Limited." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peggy_Mount> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_O'Brien> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edward John O'Brien (born 15 April 1968) is an English guitarist, songwriter and member of the rock band Radiohead. He releases solo music under the name EOB. O'Brien attended Abingdon School in Oxfordshire, England, where he met the other members of Radiohead. O'Brien said his role in the group was to \"service the songs\" and support the songwriter, Thom Yorke. He often creates ambient sounds and textures, using effects, sustain units and the EBow, and provides backing vocals. In 2010, Rolling Stone named O'Brien the 59th greatest guitarist of all time. Along with the other members of Radiohead, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. O'Brien's first solo album, Earth, was released in 2020. O'Brien had been writing songs for years, but lacked confidence and felt they had a character that would be lost with Radiohead. He began a solo North American tour in February 2020; a larger tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_O'Brien> .

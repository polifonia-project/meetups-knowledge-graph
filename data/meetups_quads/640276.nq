Collaborating initially with his first wife, Carole King, he co-wrote many international pop hits of the early and mid-1960s, including the US No.1 hits \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\", \"Take Good Care of My Baby\", \"The Loco-Motion\", and \"Go Away Little Girl\". It was later said of Goffin that his gift was \"to find words that expressed what many young people were feeling but were unable to articulate.\" After he and King divorced, Goffin wrote with other composers, including Barry Goldberg and Michael Masser, with whom he wrote \"Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)\" and \"Saving All My Love for You\", also No. 1 hits. During his career, Goffin wrote over 114 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including eight chart-toppers, and 72 UK hits. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, with Carole King." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerry_Goffin> .

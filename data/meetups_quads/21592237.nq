<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Lee_(journalist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "George Lee (born 27 September 1962) is an Irish economist, journalist, television and radio presenter, and former Fine Gael politician. He has worked for RTÉ since 1992. Since 2019, he has been Environment Correspondent for RTÉ News and Current Affairs. He previously was Economics Editor in 1996. Lee left RTÉ and became a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South constituency in June 2009, winning a by-election with a 53.4% majority and was referred to as a \"celebrity TD\". On 8 February 2010, Lee announced his resignation both from Fine Gael and from Dáil Éireann, having spent nine months in politics. His reasoning was that he had \"virtually no influence or input\". He returned to RTÉ in May 2010, and presented Mind Your Business, followed by The Business on RTÉ Radio 1 from 2010. During his time in RTÉ News, he was named Irish Journalist of the Year for uncovering a major tax evasion and overcharging scandal at National Irish Bank." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Lee_(journalist)> .

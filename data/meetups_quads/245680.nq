Tell was born October 28, 1876 to Clarinda Jane Roberts (1854-1930) and John Asbury Taylor (1853-1928), on a farm near the Village of Vanlue, Amanda Township, Hancock County, Ohio. He was an American traveling vaudeville performer, tenor vocalist, playwright, music publisher, composer, and lyricist who had written over 200 popular songs. His biggest hit was \"Down by the Old Mill Stream\" from 1910, one of the most commercially successful Tin Pan Alley publications of the era.

His other notable songs include \"He Sleeps Beneath the Soil of France,\" \"I Love You Best of All,\" \"If Dreams Come True,\" \"Little Old Home in the Valley,\" \"Rock Me to Sleep in the Old Rocking Chair,\" \"Some Day,\" and \"When the Maple Leaves Were Falling.\" Taylor also wrote the Broadway comedies Tiger Lillee and In New York Town." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tell_Taylor> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Thomson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeffrey Robert Thomson (born 16 August 1950) is a former Australian cricketer. Known as \"Thommo\", he is one of the fastest bowlers in the history of cricket; he bowled a delivery with a speed of 160.6 km/h against the West Indies in Perth in 1975, which was the fastest recorded delivery at the time, and the fourth-fastest recorded delivery of all time. He was the opening partner of fellow fast bowler Dennis Lillee; their combination was one of the most fearsome in Test cricket history. Commenting on their bowling during the 1974â€“75 season, Wisden wrote: \"... it was easy to believe they were the fastest pair ever to have coincided in a cricket team\". He was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Thomson> .

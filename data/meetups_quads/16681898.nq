<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_King_(basketball)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bob King (August 24, 1923 – December 10, 2004) was a college basketball coach and administrator. He was head coach at the University of New Mexico from 1962 to 1972 and at Indiana State University from 1975 to 1978. He also served as Assistant Athletics Director at New Mexico (1972–73) and Athletics Director at Indiana State (1974–80). King coached basketball Hall of Famers Larry Bird, Mel Daniels, and Don Nelson. The success of his New Mexico teams led to the construction of The Pit, the home venue of the Lobos, and its court is named after him. He also assembled the Indiana State team that went to the 1979 NCAA Final Four and lost in the championship game. Both schools have inducted King into their Athletics Halls of Fame, as has the Missouri Valley Conference." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_King_(basketball)> .

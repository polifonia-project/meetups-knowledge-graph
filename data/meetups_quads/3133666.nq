<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alberto_Savinio> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alberto Savinio [alˈbɛrto saˈvinjo], born as Andrea Francesco Alberto de Chirico (25 August 1891 – 5 May 1952) was a Greek-Italian writer, painter, musician, journalist, essayist, playwright, set designer and composer. He was the younger brother of 'metaphysical' painter Giorgio de Chirico. His work often dealt with philosophical and psychological themes, and he was also heavily concerned with the philosophy of art. Throughout his life, Savinio composed five operas and authored at least forty-seven books, including multiple autobiographies and memoirs. He also extensively wrote and produced works for the theatre. His work received mixed reviews during his lifetime. This was often due to his generally pervasive use of modernist techniques. He was influenced by Apollinaire, Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Max Jacob, and Fernand Léger, and had a significant influence on the surrealist movement." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alberto_Savinio> .

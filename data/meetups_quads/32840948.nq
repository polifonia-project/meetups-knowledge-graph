Gilje has presented his work through different channels throughout the world: in concert-venues, theater and cinema venues, galleries, festivals and through several international DVD releases, including 242.pilots live in Bruxelles on the New York label Carpark and Cityscapes on the Paris-label Lowave. He was a member of the video-impro trio 242.pilots, and was also the visual motor of dance company Kreutzerkompani. In 2006, Gilje initiated the research project “Conversations with Spaces” where he explores how audiovisual technology can be used to transform, create, expand, amplify and interpret physical spaces. He is also the developer of the free Video Projection Tool (VPT), a software for mapping video onto physical objects and surfaces." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/HC_Gilje> .

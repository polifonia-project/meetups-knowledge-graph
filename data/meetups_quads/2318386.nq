<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorraine_O'Grady> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lorraine O'Grady (born September 21, 1934) is an American artist, writer, translator, and critic. Working in conceptual art and performance art that integrates photo and video installation, she explores the cultural construction of identity – particularly that of Black female subjectivity – as shaped by the experience of diaspora and hybridity. O'Grady studied at Wellesley College and the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop before becoming an artist at age forty-five. Regarding the purpose of art, O'Grady said in 2016: \"I think art’s first goal is to remind us that we are human, whatever that is. I suppose the politics in my art could be to remind us that we are all human.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorraine_O'Grady> .

He studied film at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) followed by post-graduate work in screenwriting at the University of Texas at Austin moving to New York in 1987 where he worked in the New York Public Library whilst writing plays in his free time. Among the thirty plays Dunn has written (as of 2015), Belles and Five Tellers Dancing in the Rain have been produced over one hundred and fifty times. Dunn is playwright-in-residence with the New Jersey Repertory Company and the Community Theatre League in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. In 1998 Dunn sued the writers, distributors and producers of The Truman Show, claiming that the story was based on a play he had written and performed Off-Broadway in 1992, Frank's Life." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Dunn> .

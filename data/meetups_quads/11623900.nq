<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Hickox> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anthony Hickox (born 30th January 1959) is an English film director, producer, actor and screenwriter. He is best known for his work in the horror genre, with films like Waxwork and its sequel, Waxwork II: Lost in Time, Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat, Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth, and Warlock: The Armageddon. He directed a 1997 film adaptation of the long-running Prince Valiant comic strip starring Stephen Moyer as the eponymous character. His visual style often uses a dual-focus technique in which one person's face takes up most of the screen in profile, with another person shown on the other half of the screen in the background." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Hickox> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Danzer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Georg Franz Danzer (7 October 1946, in Vienna – 21 June 2007, in Asperhofen, Lower Austria) was an Austrian singer-songwriter. Although he is credited as one of the pioneers of Austropop (most famous are his comic songs \"Jö schau\" (about a streaker at the Café Hawelka) and \"Hupf' in Gatsch\", both in Viennese German), he always refused to be part of this genre. Danzer was successful as a solo artist, but also in the group Austria3, along with Wolfgang Ambros and Rainhard Fendrich. Besides his music, he translated two books from Spanish into German, and was strongly involved in highlighting social inequalities, opposing racism and any form of societal discrimination, and the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie for all his life. Danzer was romantic, funny, socially engaged – and often a misfit. Having been a strong smoker for decades, he abstained from smoking after being diagnosed with lung cancer, but nevertheless died from the disease. His legacy includes some 400 songs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Danzer> .

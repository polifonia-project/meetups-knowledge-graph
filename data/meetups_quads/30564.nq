<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Sturgeon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Theodore Sturgeon (/ˈstɜːrdʒən/; born Edward Hamilton Waldo, February 26, 1918 – May 8, 1985) was an American fiction author of primarily fantasy, science fiction and horror, as well as a critic. He wrote approximately 400 reviews and more than 120 short stories, 11 novels and several scripts for Star Trek: The Original Series. Sturgeon's science fiction novel More Than Human (1953) won the 1954 International Fantasy Award (for SF and fantasy) as the year's best novel, and the Science Fiction Writers of America ranked \"Baby Is Three\" number five among the \"Greatest Science Fiction Novellas of All Time\" to 1964. Ranked by votes for all of their pre-1965 novellas, Sturgeon was second among authors, behind Robert Heinlein. An overview of his work by science fiction critic Sam Moskowitz can be found in the collective biography Seekers of Tomorrow. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Sturgeon in 2000, its fifth class of two dead and two living writers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Sturgeon> .

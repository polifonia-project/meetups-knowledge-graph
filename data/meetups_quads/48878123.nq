<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Cuffaro> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chris Cuffaro (born April 14, 1960) is an American photographer. Primarily known for his portraits of musicians, Cuffaro has photographed Michael Hutchence, Henry Rollins, George Michael, George Harrison and Jane's Addiction, among others. He was closely associated with the Seattle rock scene of the early 1990s, and frequently photographed artists including Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Cuffaro made several music videos. Most notably, he directed the first video for the Pearl Jam song \"Jeremy.\" Although Pearl Jam's label supported the effort - Cuffaro and Eddie Vedder had become friendsâ€”the label ultimately shelved the black-and-white video, instead commissioning a more commercial video when \"Jeremy\" was released as a single in 1991. Composed of 100 photographs, the first exhibition of Cuffaro's photography was held in Los Angeles in 1992. In 2011, his portraits of Michael Hutchence and INXS were exhibited in London. Titled Michael Hutchence & INXS: Rare & Unseen by Chris Cuffaro, it was held at the Gallery Soho. In 2014, work began on Cuffaro's Greatest Hits,an exhibit based on Cuffaro's 30-year career as a photographer. The exhibitions will be accompanied by a documentary." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Cuffaro> .

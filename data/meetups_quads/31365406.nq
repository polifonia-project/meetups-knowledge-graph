<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Hines> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Derek Jabez Hines (8 February 1931 - August 2001) was an English football player who played for Derby County, Shrewsbury Town, Rugby Town and most notably Leicester City. During his time at Leicester he forged a prolific strike partnership with Arthur Rowley and helped Leicester to the Second Division title in both 1953-54 and 1956-57. He scored 117 goals in total for the club making him the club's 4th top goalscorer of all-time. He is also the last person to score 4 goals in one game for the club in a 6-3 victory over Aston Villa in November 1958. He returned to the club for a spell as youth team coach in the 1970s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Hines> .

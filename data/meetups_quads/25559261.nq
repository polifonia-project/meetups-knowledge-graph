<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Yezerski> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Yezerski is an Australian composer known for his scores for feature films such as The Waiting City, The Black Balloon (for which he won an APRA Award and a Screen Music Award), Newcastle, and Thursday's Fictions, as well as collaborations with the Australian Chamber Orchestra and the Gondwana Voices Children's Choir (such as an adaptation of Shaun Tan's book The Red Tree), the National Museum of Canberra, Synergy Percussion and The Physical TV Company. In an interview with Headliner Magazine, Yezerski discussed composing the score for 2019 horror film, The Vigil: \"Why have there been so many horror films that have explored the various denominations of Christianity and demons and devils and everything associated with Christianity, but there has hardly ever been a film that explores the dark side of Jewish mysticism? I'm Jewish myself, so this is exactly the question that I've been asking. What I love about horror films, and dark, edgy films, in general â€“ there's so much creative license to play with musical effects in non traditional ways. It's really fun as a composer.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Yezerski> .

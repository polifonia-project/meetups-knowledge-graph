As a boy he originally wanted to play trumpet but ended up with a toy accordion. He started playing guitar at the age of 11, his parents bought him a cheap Spanish guitar for Christmas, and he soon realised, listening to the twangy tones of Duane Eddy, Hank Marvin, The Ventures, etc., that this was what he wanted to do." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Warner_(musician)> .

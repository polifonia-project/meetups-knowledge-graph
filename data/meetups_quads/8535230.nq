<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doug_Parkinson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Douglas John Parkinson (30 October 1946 – 15 March 2021) was an Australian pop and rock singer. He led the bands Strings and Things/A Sound (1965), the Questions (1966–1968), Doug Parkinson in Focus (1968–1970, 1971), Fanny Adams (1970–1971), the Life Organisation (1973), Southern Star Band (1978–1980) and Doug Parkinson Band (1981–1983). Doug Parkinson in Focus's cover version of the Beatles' track \"Dear Prudence\" (May 1969) peaked at No. 5 on the Go-Set National Top 40. The follow up single, \"Without You\" / \"Hair\" (October), also reached No. 5. Parkinson released solo material and performed in musical theatre productions. Two studio albums associated with Parkinson: I'll Be Around (March 1979) by Southern Star Band and Heartbeat to Heartbeat (March 1983) by Doug Parkinson Band, reached the National Top 60. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane wrote that Parkinson, \"conveyed considerable charisma with his imposing presence, 'Lucifer' beard and gruff, raspy voice. He also surrounded himself with mature, seasoned musicians who added to his appeal.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doug_Parkinson> .

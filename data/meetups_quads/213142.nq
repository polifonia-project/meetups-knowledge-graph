December 24, 2002) was an American woman who was the subject of a highly publicized murder case after she disappeared while eight months pregnant with her first child. She was reportedly last seen alive on December 24, 2002. Her husband, Scott Peterson, was later convicted of first-degree murder for her death, and second-degree murder for the death of their unborn son Conner. Since his conviction, Peterson has been housed at San Quentin State Prison. His death sentence was overturned on August 24, 2020. He was re-sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on December 8, 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder_of_Laci_Peterson> .

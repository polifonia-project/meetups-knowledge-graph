He financed the extended play Safety (1998) and single-handedly managed the group during their early years. They signed with Parlophone in 1999 and found global fame through the release of Parachutes (2000) and subsequent records. After separating from the band for four years due to overworking, he returned to the line-up as a creative director, making cameo appearances in many of their music videos as well. He won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year as part of Coldplay. They have sold over 100 million albums worldwide as of 2021, making them the most successful group of the 21st century." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phil_Harvey_(manager)> .

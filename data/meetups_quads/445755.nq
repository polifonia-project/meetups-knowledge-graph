<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yossi_Beilin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Yosef \"Yossi\" Beilin (Hebrew: יוסף \"יוסי\" ביילין, born 12 June 1948) is an Israeli politician who has served in multiple ministerial and leadership positions in the Israeli government. Much of his political career was in the Labour Party. He also served as chairman of the Meretz-Yachad political party. After retiring from political life, Beilin founded 'Beilink', a business consultancy company. He also writes opinion pieces in Israeli papers Haaretz and Israel Hayom. Beilin was a significant figure in the 1990s Israeli–Palestinian peace process. Then serving as Deputy Foreign Minister, he participated in the back-channel negotiations that eventually led to the adoption of the 1993 Oslo Accords, a framework agreement to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yossi_Beilin> .

He played as a centre back in the Football League for Huddersfield Town, Bury, Port Vale, Hull City, Swindon Town and Hartlepool United, and managed in the Football League with Hartlepool United. Collins started his career with Huddersfield Town in 1994 before he transferred to Bury in 1999. After three years he moved on to Port Vale, where he established himself as captain. He was named as the club's Player of the Year at the end of the 2002â€“03 season. Collins' performances earned him a move to Hull City in 2006, though a series of knee injuries blighted his time at the club. Loaned to Swindon Town for a brief spell in 2007, the following year he signed permanently with Hartlepool United. Collins took on a coaching role with Hartlepool in 2014 and had three spells as caretaker manager before leaving the club in 2017. He spent a year as a coach at Bradford City before becoming youth-team manager at York City. He took over as manager in August 2018, initially as caretaker manager, before leaving in January 2019. He has since coached at Barnsley and Mansfield Town." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Collins_(footballer,_born_1977)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Fossett> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Stephen Fossett (April 22, 1944 – September 3, 2007) was an American businessman and a record-setting aviator, sailor, and adventurer. He was the first person to fly solo nonstop around the world in a balloon and in a fixed-wing aircraft. He made his fortune in the financial services industry and held world records for five nonstop circumnavigations of the Earth: as a long-distance solo balloonist, as a sailor, and as a solo flight fixed-wing aircraft pilot. A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club, Fossett set more than one hundred records in five different sports, sixty of which still stood at the time of his death. He broke three of the seven absolute world records for fixed-wing aircraft recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, all in his Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer. In 2002, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club of the UK, and was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2007. Fossett disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying a light aircraft over the Great Basin Desert, between Nevada and California. Extensive searches proved unsuccessful, and he was declared legally dead in February of the following year. In September 2008, a hiker found Fossett's identification cards in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, leading shortly thereafter to the discovery of the plane's wreckage. Fossett's only known remains, two large bones, were found half a mile (800 m) from the crash site, probably scattered by wild animals." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Fossett> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clark_Martell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clark Reid Martell (born December 23, 1959) is an American white supremacist and the former leader of Chicago Area SkinHeads (CASH), which was founded in 1985 by six skinheads under his leadership. This was the first organized neo-Nazi white power skinhead group in the United States. The group was also called Romantic Violence, and was the first US distributor of records and tapes from the English band Skrewdriver. In June 1989, Martell was sentenced to 11 years in prison for beating up a 20-year-old woman who quit a neo-Nazi group and allegedly had black friends. He drew a swastika on the wall using her blood. While in prison, he appeared in an episode of Oprah via phone connection, stating his views on white nationalism." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clark_Martell> .

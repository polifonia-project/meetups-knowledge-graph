He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name of Shelton Benjamin.

Within the World Wrestling Council (WWC), he won the Universal Heavyweight Championship once. Prior to becoming a professional wrestler, he was a two-sport athlete in college. Benjamin won an NJCAA championship in both track and field and collegiate wrestling. After attending junior college, he completed his degree from the University of Minnesota.

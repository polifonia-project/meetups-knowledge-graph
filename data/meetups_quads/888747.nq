<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigurd_Ring> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sigurd Ring (Old Norse: Sigurðr Hringr, in some sources merely called Hringr) according to legend was a king of the Swedes, being mentioned in many old Scandinavian sagas. According to these sources he was granted rulership over Sweden as a vassal king under his uncle Harald Wartooth. Later he would take up arms against his uncle Harald in a bid to overthrow him and take the crown of Denmark, a conflict which Sigurd eventually won after the legendary Battle of the Brávellir, where it is said that Odin himself intervened and killed Harald. In the Sagas, Sigurd is also known for being the father of the Norse Viking hero and legendary king of Denmark and Sweden, Ragnar Lodbrok. According to Bósa saga ok Herrauds, there was once a saga on Sigurd Ring, but this saga is now lost." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigurd_Ring> .

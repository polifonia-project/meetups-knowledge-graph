She is known for her unique blend of romantic escapism and dreamlike progressive rock, leading to music journalist Dom Lawson dubbing her \"The new queen of psychedelic prog\". Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Crane began her career in music fronting gothic rock band Solemn Novena in 2006, with whom she gained a small following and performed on both of their releases. In 2016 she joined The Eden House and debuted on their 2017 album Songs for the Broken Ones. Crane made her solo debut in 2020, with the album Deep Blue which included contributions from progressive rock veterans Jakko Jakszyk and Ian Anderson, and Fireball Ministry bassist Scott Reeder. In the United Kingdom, the album entered the Official Rock & Metal Albums Chart at number 8, and the Official Independent Albums Chart at number 20. At the end of 2020, Crane ranked number 5 in Prog's Readers' Poll of the Best Female Vocalists. Outside of her music career, Crane is a visual artist and has produced album artworks for the band Grooving in Green, and vocalist Monica Richards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louise_Patricia_Crane> .

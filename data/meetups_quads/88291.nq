<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wendy_Hiller> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dame Wendy Margaret Hiller, DBE (15 August 1912 â€“ 14 May 2003) was an English film and stage actress who enjoyed a varied acting career that spanned nearly 60 years. Writer Joel Hirschorn, in his 1984 compilation Rating the Movie Stars, described her as \"a no-nonsense actress who literally took command of the screen whenever she appeared on film\". Despite many notable film performances, Hiller chose to remain primarily a stage actress. Hiller won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Separate Tables (1958). Her performance as Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion (1938) earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wendy_Hiller> .

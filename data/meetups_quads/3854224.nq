<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shin_Sang-ok> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shin Sang-ok (Korean: 신상옥; born Shin Tae-seo; October 11, 1926 – April 11, 2006) was a South Korean filmmaker with more than 100 producer and 70 director credits to his name. His best-known films were made in the 1950s and 60s, many of them collaborations with his wife Choi Eun-hee, when he was known as \"The Prince of South Korean Cinema\". He received the Gold Crown Cultural Medal, the country's top honor for an artist. In 1978, Shin and Choi were kidnapped by North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, for the purpose of producing critically acclaimed films. The two remained in captivity for 8 years until 1986, when they escaped and sought asylum in the United States. Shin continued to produce and direct films in America, now under the pseudonym \"Simon Sheen\", before eventually returning to South Korea for his final years." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shin_Sang-ok> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanno_the_Navigator> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hanno the Navigator (sometimes \"Hannon\"; Punic: 𐤇‬𐤍‬𐤀‬, ḤNʾ; Greek: Ἄννων, romanized: Annōn ) was a Carthaginian explorer of the fifth century BC, best known for his naval exploration of the western coast of Africa. The only source of his voyage is a periplus translated into Greek. He has sometimes been identified as a king. Historians have attempted to identify places on Hanno's route based on the periplus. According to some modern analyses of his route, Hanno's expedition could have reached as far south as Gabon; however, according to others, it could not have taken him further than southern Morocco." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanno_the_Navigator> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_Waithe> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Keith Waithe is a Guyana-born musician, composer and teacher who has been based in the United Kingdom since 1977. He is best known as a flautist and founder of the Macusi Players – a world music jazz band whose name derives from the indigenous Guyanese Macushi people – and has been \"acknowledged as the best flute player that Guyana has ever produced\". His musical style explores a fusion of jazz, classical, African, Caribbean, Asian and Western influences, and he has also developed a technique he calls \"vocal gymnastics\", in which he uses the voice to reproduce percussive sounds. Music critic Kevin Le Gendre notes that Waithe \"has single-mindedly pursued his own artistic agenda, developing a songbook that draws heavily on African-Caribbean and Asian folk traditions as well as jazz ingenuity in a manner not dissimilar to a large number of his forebears, of which Yusef Lateef is perhaps the most direct reference.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Keith_Waithe> .

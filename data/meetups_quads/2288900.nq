<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Baseman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gary Baseman (born September 27, 1960) is an American artist, cartoonist, and animator who investigates history, heritage, and the human condition (especially love, longing, and loss). Through iconography and visual narratives that celebrate “the beauty of the bittersweetness of life,” his work brings together the worlds of popular culture and fine art. Baseman’s career includes illustration for clients including The New York Times, Rolling Stone, and The Wall Street Journal and the bestselling board game Cranium; as well as animation for the Emmy and BAFTA award-winning series Teacher’s Pet and its subsequent feature-length film of the same name for ABC/Disney. He is a frequent speaker at international conferences on graphic and multidisciplinary arts and visual communications. Recent projects include a collaboration with COACH; a documentary Mythical Creatures about his family heritage; a traveling retrospective that featured hundreds of his paintings, photographs, videos, and toy and costume designs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Baseman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daryl_Gates> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daryl Gates (born Darrel Francis Gates; August 30, 1926 – April 16, 2010) was the Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) from 1978 to 1992. His length of tenure in this position was second only to that of William H. Parker. As Chief of the LAPD, he took a hardline, aggressive, paramilitary approach to law enforcement that affected black and Latino Angelenos far more often than their white counterparts. Gates is co-credited with the creation of SWAT teams with LAPD's John Nelson, who others claim was the originator of SWAT in 1965. Gates also co-founded D.A.R.E. After the Rodney King arrest and the riots afterward, Gates retired from the police department. Much of the blame was attributed to him. According to one study, \"scandalous racist violence... marked the LAPD under Gates’s tempestuous leadership.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daryl_Gates> .

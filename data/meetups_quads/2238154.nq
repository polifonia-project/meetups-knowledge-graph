<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Fried> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Martin Fried (born April 12, 1939 in New York City) is a modernist art critic and art historian. He studied at Princeton University and Harvard University and was a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford. He is the J.R. Herbert Boone Professor Emeritus of Humanities and Art History at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Fried's contribution to art historical discourse involved the debate over the origins and development of modernism. Along with Fried, this debate's interlocutors include other theorists and critics such as Clement Greenberg, T. J. Clark, and Rosalind Krauss. Since the early 1960s, he has also been close to philosopher Stanley Cavell. Fried was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985 and the American Philosophical Society in 2003." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Fried> .

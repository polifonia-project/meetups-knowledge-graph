Price (born October 18, 1966) is an American journalist and weather forecaster who is currently working for WNBC-TV in New York as a weekday afternoon weatherman. Price is perhaps best known for his time on CBS television's The Early Show, where he was the daily forecaster and a primary fill-in co-host for Harry Smith. He was the co-host and weatherman for Fox 5 WNYW's Good Day New York from 1999-2003. In 2012, he was brought back to replace Greg Kelly as Rosanna Scotto's co-anchor, as Kelly was promoted to replace Ernie Anastos as the station's lead anchor for its evening newscasts. In January 2013, Price was replaced by Greg Kelly, and he left the station." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Price> .

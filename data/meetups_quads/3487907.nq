<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kris_Kobach> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kris William Kobach (/ˈkoʊbɑːk/ KOH-bahk; born March 26, 1966) is an American lawyer and politician who is the Attorney General-elect of Kansas. He previously served as the 31st Secretary of State of Kansas. A former Chairman of the Kansas Republican Party, Kobach came to national prominence over his far-right anti-immigration views, including involvement in the implementation of high-profile anti-immigration ordinances in various American cities. Kobach is also known for his calls for stronger voter ID laws in the United States, reinstating the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, and his advocacy for anti-abortion legislation. He has made claims about the extent of voter fraud in the United States that studies and fact-checkers have concluded are false or unsubstantiated. Kobach began his political career as a member of the City Council of Overland Park, Kansas. He was later the Republican nominee in Kansas's 3rd congressional district in the 2004 election, losing to Democratic incumbent Dennis Moore. He was elected Secretary of State of Kansas in 2010, winning nearly 60% of the total vote. As Secretary of State of Kansas, Kobach implemented some of the strictest voter identification laws in the history of the United States and fought to remove nearly 20,000 registered voters from the state's voter rolls. Kobach announced in June 2017 that he would run in the 2018 primary for Governor of Kansas against then-Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, who became governor in January 2018 following the resignation of Sam Brownback. After narrowly defeating Colyer in the Republican primary by less than 500 votes, Kobach was defeated by Democrat Laura Kelly in the general election. In July 2019, Kobach launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate in the 2020 campaign after Senator Pat Roberts announced his retirement. Upon the campaign's launch, Kobach implied he had Trump's support. Kobach's main opponent in the Republican primary August 4 was U.S. Representative Roger Marshall, who received 40 percent of the vote to Kobach's 26 percent; nine other candidates split the remaining 33.5 percent of the vote. The Republican nominee for Kansas Attorney General in 2022, he was narrowly elected to the post November 8, 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kris_Kobach> .

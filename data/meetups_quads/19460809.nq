<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ryback> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ryback Allen Reeves (né Ryan; born November 10, 1981) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his time in WWE where he performed under the ring name Ryback. One of the eight finalists on WWE's Tough Enough 4, Reeves later signed a developmental contract with WWE and wrestled in three of its developmental territories: Deep South Wrestling (DSW), Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), and Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). In 2010, as Skip Sheffield, he participated in the first season of NXT, joined WWE's main roster as part of The Nexus, and headlined SummerSlam before being sidelined due to injury. Following his 2012 return as Ryback, he headlined multiple WWE pay-per-view events – generally in contention for the WWE Championship – and became a one-time Intercontinental Champion prior to his release from the company in 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ryback> .

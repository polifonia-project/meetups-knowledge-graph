<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Leake> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Raymond Leake (born November 12, 1987) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds, San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, Seattle Mariners, and Arizona Diamondbacks. Leake played college baseball for the Arizona State Sun Devils of Arizona State University. The Reds selected Leake in the first round of the 2009 MLB draft. They promoted him to the major leagues at the start of the 2010 season without having him pitch in the minor leagues, making him the 21st player to go straight from the draft to the major league team that drafted him. Leake pitched for the Reds through 2015, at which point he was traded to the Giants. A free agent that offseason, he signed with the Cardinals. The Cardinals traded him to the Mariners in 2017. He was traded for a third time in his career in 2019 as the Arizona Diamondbacks agreed to acquire him at the Trade Deadline." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Leake> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/LaWanda_Page> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "LaWanda Page (born Alberta Peal; October 19, 1920 – September 14, 2002) was an American actress, comedian, and dancer whose career spanned six decades. Crowned \"The Queen of Comedy\" or \"The Black Queen of Comedy\", Page melded blue humor, signifyin', and observational comedy to joke about sexuality, race relations, African-American culture, and religion. She released five solo albums, including the 1977 gold-selling Watch It, Sucker!. She also collaborated on two albums with comedy group Skillet, Leroy & Co. As an actress, Page is best known for portraying the Bible-toting and sharp-tongued \"Aunt\" Esther Anderson in the popular television sitcom Sanford and Son, which originally aired from 1972 until 1977. Page later reprised this role in the short-lived television shows Sanford Arms (1976–1977) and Sanford (1980–1981). She also co-starred in the 1979 short-lived series Detective School. Throughout her career, Page advocated for fair pay and equal opportunities for Black performers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/LaWanda_Page> .

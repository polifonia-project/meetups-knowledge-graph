<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Osborne> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John James Osborne (12 December 1929 â€“ 24 December 1994) was an English playwright, screenwriter and actor, known for his prose that criticized established social and political norms. The success of his 1956 play Look Back in Anger transformed English theatre. Osborne was notorious for his violent language, not only on behalf of the political causes he supported but also against his own family, including his wives and children. Osborne was one of the first writers to address Britain's purpose in the post-imperial age." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Osborne> .

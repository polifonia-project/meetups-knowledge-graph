<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawne_Merriman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shawne DeAndre Merriman (born May 25, 1984), nicknamed \"Lights Out\", is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Maryland Terrapins and was selected 12th overall by the San Diego Chargers in the 2005 NFL Draft. He earned NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year honors in his first season and recorded 39+1‚ÅÑ2 quarterback sacks in his first three seasons, also making three Pro Bowls as well as two All-Pro selections. He was hampered by injuries his next three seasons, and the Chargers waived Merriman midseason in 2010. He was picked up through waivers by the Buffalo Bills that season, but he only played minimally with the Bills due to continued injuries. He was released by the Bills before the 2012 season before they re-signed him mid-season. He retired at the end of the 2012 season." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shawne_Merriman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorenzo_Regazzo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lorenzo Regazzo, (born in Venice) is an opera singer. His voice can be categorised as bass, bass-baritone or basso cantante. He is especially well known for interpreting Baroque, Classical, and bel canto repertoire. Among the qualities frequently noted by the critical press are his virtuosic coloratura technique, sumptuous tone, and vivid stage presence. Performing at the major opera and concert venues of Europe, as well as in Japan and the USA, Regazzo has also been a regular guest at musical events such as the Salzburg Festival and the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro. Among the conductors he collaborated with are Simon Rattle, Riccardo Muti, Lorin Maazel, Colin Davis, Claudio Abbado, Riccardo Chailly, Daniele Gatti, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Jesús López-Cobos and Marcello Viotti. He has made Baroque music recordings and took part in live performances with such specialists of the genre as René Jacobs, Emmanuelle Haïm, Rinaldo Alessandrini, Jean-Christophe Spinosi, Fabio Biondi, Claudio Scimone, and Andrea Marcon. Regazzo holds degrees in singing, piano, choral music, and choral conducting, and has studied voice with Sesto Bruscantini and Regina Resnik. His operatic début (in Rossini's L'inganno felice) took place in 1994 at the Pesaro Festival." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorenzo_Regazzo> .

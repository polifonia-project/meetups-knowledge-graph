<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_B._Anderson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Bernard Anderson (June 4, 1910 â€“ August 14, 1989) was an American administrator, politician, and businessman. He served as the Secretary of the Navy between February 1953 and March 1954. He also served as the Secretary of the Treasury from 1957 until 1961, and was one of President Dwight Eisenhower's closest confidants. Two years before his death from cancer, he was disbarred for illegal banking operations and tax evasion. In the 1980s, Anderson illegally operated an Anguilla-based bank. The bank was involved in money laundering for drug traffickers. Anderson pleaded guilty to criminal violations of the banking laws, and was sentenced to prison." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_B._Anderson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dannii_Minogue> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Danielle Jane Minogue (/mɪˈnoʊɡ/; born 20 October 1971) is an Australian singer, television personality, and actress. She initially gained recognition for her appearances on the television show Young Talent Time (1982–1988) and for her role as Emma Jackson on the soap opera Home and Away (1989–1990). Minogue began her music career in the early 1990s, achieving early success with her debut studio album, Love and Kisses (1991); the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry and included the hit singles \"Love and Kisses\", \"Baby Love\", \"Jump to the Beat\" and \"Success\". Following the release of her second studio album, Get into You (1993), Minogue's popularity as a singer had declined, leading her to make a name for herself with award-winning performances in theatre productions. The late 1990s saw a brief return to music after Minogue reinvented herself as a dance artist with her third studio album, Girl (1997), and its lead single \"All I Wanna Do\". Her fourth studio album, Neon Nights (2003), became the most successful of her career and spawned the hit singles \"Who Do You Love Now?\", \"I Begin to Wonder\", \"Put the Needle on It\", and \"Don't Wanna Lose This Feeling\". In 2007, she released her fifth studio album, Club Disco. In the UK, Minogue has achieved nine UK Top 10 singles and 13 consecutive number one dance singles, becoming the best-performing artist on the UK Dance Chart. In Australia, she has achieved twelve Top 30 singles and six Gold certified singles. Minogue has sold over 8 million records worldwide. Since 2007, Minogue has served as a judge on multiple television talent shows, including The X Factor UK (2007–2010), Australia's Got Talent (2007–2012), Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model (2013), The X Factor Australia (2013–2015), Let It Shine (2017), and The Masked Singer Australia (2019–2021). She starred in her own reality series Style Queen (2010), and has presented the television shows It's Not Just Saturday (1996), Dance Boss (2018), and Ultimate Beastmaster (2018)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dannii_Minogue> .

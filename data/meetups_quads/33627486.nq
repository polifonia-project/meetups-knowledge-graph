<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Klose> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Friedrich Klose (born 29 November 1862 in Karlsruhe, Germany; died 24 December 1942 in Ruvigliana, Switzerland) was a German composer. He studied with Vinzenz Lachner in Karlsruhe, and then with Anton Bruckner in Vienna, and recorded his impressions of his time with Bruckner in a book. His Mass in d-minor was written in response to Franz Liszt's death. His opera (1903) is inspired by the music of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, and the plot is based on the Brothers Grimm tale of a fisherman who catches a huge fish which grants ever increasingly more greedy wishes and this is reflected in the increasing complexity of orchestration during the opera. It was premiered in 1903 in Karlsruhe under the direction of Felix Mottl. He ended his career as a composer and a teacher in 1919 and retired to Switzerland." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Klose> .

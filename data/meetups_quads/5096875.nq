<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Barr> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Leland Barr (born February 10, 1948) is an American former professional baseball right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the San Francisco Giants (1971–1978, 1982–1983) and California Angels (1979–1980). In 1972, Barr set an MLB record when he retired 41 consecutive batters over the course of two starts. The record was later tied by Bobby Jenks in 2007, and then broken by Mark Buehrle on July 28, 2009 and again by Yusmeiro Petit on August 28, 2014. Barr remains the only pitcher to retire at least 41 consecutive batters in the course of only two games; his streak began in the third inning of a complete-game win and extended through the seventh inning of another complete-game win (Beurhle's streak included his perfect game and the starts before and after, while the streaks of Jenks and Petit included a number of relief appearances)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Barr> .

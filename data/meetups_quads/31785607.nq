He currently competes for the National Wrestling Alliance. He is best known for his time in Ring of Honor (ROH), where he is a former ROH World Tag Team Champion, and also competed in the WWE under the ring name Mike Kanellis and Impact Wrestling where he was a member of Honor No More After a few years on the independent circuit, Bennett made his Ring of Honor (ROH) debut in 2008; his character was named The Prodigy. With his then-girlfriend Maria Kanellis, he worked as part of \"The Kingdom\" stable, winning the ROH World Tag Team Championship with Matt Taven. ROH's talent-sharing agreement with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) enabled the tag team to make limited appearances in Japan, where they won NJPW's IWGP Tag Team Championship. Bennett and Taven also operate a wrestling school in West Warwick, Rhode Island. Bennett left ROH in late-2015 to sign with rival promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he won the TNA X Division Championship. In 2017, Bennett joined his wife Maria in WWE (whose maiden name was used as his character's surname), where held the WWE 24/7 Championship twice." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Bennett_(wrestler)> .

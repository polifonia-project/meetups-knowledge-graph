He has held five ministerial positions and six shadow ministerial positions. Hayes was appointed as a Privy Councillor in April 2013, and a Knight Bachelor in November 2018. Hayes is considered a social conservative, economic protectionist, communitarian and Eurosceptic. He strongly supported Britain's withdrawal from the EU and has spoken regularly about his belief in conservative ideas and philosophy. Hayes is known for speaking passionately and theatrically in the House of Commons chamber and has been described as a \"colourful character\" who is \"popular and influential on the Tory right\". First elected in 1997, Hayes is the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of South Holland and The Deepings - the safest Conservative seat in the United Kingdom. South Holland delivered the nation's second-highest Leave vote in the 2016 referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union. 73.6% of voters voted for withdrawal from the EU, second only to neighbouring Boston." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hayes_(British_politician)> .

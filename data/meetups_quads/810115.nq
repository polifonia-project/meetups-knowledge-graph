<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Russell_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bruce Russell (born 1960) is a New Zealand experimental musician and writer. He is a founding member and guitarist of the noise rock trio The Dead C and the free noise combo A Handful of Dust (with Alastair Galbraith). He has released solo albums featuring guitar and tape manipulation, and has contributed articles to British music magazine The Wire. He established the Xpressway record label, which was active from 1985 until the early 1990s, releasing mostly cassettes and a few records. Russell then founded the Corpus Hermeticum record label. Xpressway released only music by New Zealanders, usually song-based. Corpus Hermeticum releases, in contrast, may feature New Zealand or international artists, and they eschew song forms in favour of free-form, experimental, usually improvised sounds. In summer of 2013, Bruce Russell's daughter Olive Russell uploaded a documentary of her father that she shot and edited herself called \"27 Minutes with Mr. Noisy: A Documentary about Bruce Russell\" to Vimeo.com." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Russell_(musician)> .

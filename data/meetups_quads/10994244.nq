He is Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University, and was Dean of Harvard College from 1995 to 2003. Lewis has been honored for his \"particularly distinguished contributions to undergraduate teaching\"; his students have included future entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, and numerous future faculty members at Harvard and other schools.The website \"Six Degrees to Harry Lewis\", created by Zuckerberg while at Harvard, was a precursor to Facebook. A new professorship in Engineering and Applied Sciences, endowed by a former student, will be named for Lewis and his wife upon their retirements." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_R._Lewis> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Smith_(darts_player)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dennis Smith (born 2 August 1969) is an English professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events. He is a stalwart on the PDC circuit, having played there since 1994, but has yet to capture a major title to add to his collection of Open wins. Smith has a very unusual throwing action, turning the dart into a 'flight first' position before returning it to a 'point first' position, rolling his eyes and then throwing. He has a unique, measured action learning his trade under the tutelage of Bob Anderson." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Smith_(darts_player)> .

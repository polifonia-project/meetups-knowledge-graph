<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Chamberlain> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Leigh Chamberlain (27 February 1944 â€“ 9 January 2017) was a New Zealand-Australian writer, teacher and pastor falsely implicated in the August 1980 death of his missing daughter Azaria, which was later demonstrated to be the result of a dingo attack while the family was camping near Uluru (then usually called Ayers Rock) in the Northern Territory, Australia. Chamberlain's then-wife Lindy was falsely convicted of the baby's murder in 1982 and he was convicted of being an accessory after the fact. The findings of a 1987 royal commission ultimately exonerated the couple, but not before they were subjected to sensationalist reporting and intense public scrutiny." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Chamberlain> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Giovanni Domenico Cassini, also known as Jean-Dominique Cassini (8 June 1625 â€“ 14 September 1712) was an Italian (naturalised French) mathematician, astronomer and engineer. Cassini was born in Perinaldo, near Imperia, at that time in the County of Nice, part of the Savoyard state. Cassini is known for his work on astronomy and engineering. He discovered four satellites of the planet Saturn and noted the division of the rings of Saturn; the Cassini Division was named after him. Giovanni Domenico Cassini was also the first of his family to begin work on the project of creating a topographic map of France. The Cassini space probe, launched in 1997, was named after him and became the fourth to visit the planet Saturn and the first to orbit the planet." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophie_Treadwell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sophie Anita Treadwell (October 3, 1885 â€“ February 20, 1970) was an American playwright and journalist of the first half of the 20th century. She is best known for her play Machinal which is often included in drama anthologies as an example of an expressionist or modernist play. Treadwell wrote dozens of plays, several novels, as well as serial stories and countless articles that appeared in newspapers. In addition to writing plays for the theatre, Treadwell also produced, directed and acted in some of her productions. The styles and subjects of Treadwell's writings are vast, but many present women's issues of her time, subjects of current media coverage, or aspects of Treadwell's Mexican heritage." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophie_Treadwell> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leslie_Mitchell_(broadcaster)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Leslie Scott Falconer Mitchell (4 October 1905 â€“ 23 November 1985) was a British announcer who was heard on newsreel soundtracks, radio and television. He was the first voice heard on BBC Television at its inception on 2 November 1936, and also made the first announcement on Associated-Rediffusion, the first ITV company, on 22 September 1955. His voice was perhaps most recognised, however, from his long association with British Movietone News, for whose newsreels he commentated during the Second World War and for many years afterwards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leslie_Mitchell_(broadcaster)> .

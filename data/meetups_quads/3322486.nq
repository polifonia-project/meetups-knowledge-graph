<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juan_Ponce_Enrile> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Juan Valentin Furagganan Ponce Enrile Sr., CLH (born Juanito Furagganan; February 14, 1924), also referred to by his initials JPE, is a Filipino politician and lawyer known for his role in the administration of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos; his role in the failed coup that helped hasten the 1986 People Power Revolution and the ouster of Marcos; and his tenure in the Philippine legislature in the years after the revolution. In 2022, at the age of 98, he returned to government office as the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel in the administration of Bongbong Marcos. Enrile was a protégé of President Ferdinand Marcos and served as Justice Secretary and Defense Minister during the Marcos administration. Enrile played a key role in the planning and documentary legwork for Martial Law, and was in charge of the Philippine Military during its implementation. Other roles in this period included Presidency of the Philippine Coconut Authority through which he gained control of the copra industry together with Danding Cojuangco, and being the general put in charge of logging in the Philippines under martial law - a period during which lumber exports were so extensive that the forest cover of the Philippines shrank until only 8% remained. By the 1980s, however, rising factionalism in the Marcos administration led to a reduction in Enrile's influence within the administration. Enrile and General Fidel Ramos, along with several other military officers, withdrew their support for Marcos in February 1986. Before Marcos could put down the leaders of the failed coup, civilians who were already preparing mass protests in response to electoral fraud during the 1986 Philippine presidential election went en masse to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue near where Enrile and Ramos were encamped, preventing Marcos from assaulting the coup organizers. This was one of the key moments of the 1986 People Power Revolution that drove Marcos out of power and into exile. Enrile has continued to be a politician since then; he was the Senate President from November 2008 until his resignation on June 5, 2013. He remained a Senator until 2016, latterly as Minority Leader." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Juan_Ponce_Enrile> .

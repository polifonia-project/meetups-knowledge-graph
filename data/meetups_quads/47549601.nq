<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lloyd_Newson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lloyd Newson OBE (born 1957) is a director, dancer and choreographer. He formed DV8 Physical Theatre and has led the company since its inception in 1986. He studied psychology and social work at Melbourne University and after graduating began his dancing career in New Zealand, initially as a dancer but later also as a choreographer. DV8 Physical Theatre was formed as a response to Newson's increasing frustration with the superficiality of contemporary dance. DV8's work is characterised by the desire to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously, with a focus on socio-political issues. Under the banner of DV8 Physical Theatre, Newson's work has won 55 national and international awards. He has choreographed and directed DV8's work since its inception, with the exception of My Sex; Our Dance (1986) which was co-created with performer Nigel Charnock. Between 1986 and 1992 Newson frequently collaborated with performers Michelle Richecoeur, Nigel Charnock and Wendy Houstoun. Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men premiered in 1988, and was the first of Newson's work to be adapted for film (1990). Further film translations of stage shows include Strange Fish (1992), Enter Achilles (1995), and The Cost of Living (2004). Living Costs (2003) was the company's first site specific performance, in collaboration with Tate Modern, and featured elements from the stage production The Cost of Living. In 2004 Newson conceived and directed the film version of this work which was set on location in Cromer, an English seaside town. Since 2007, Newson's work has combined his individual style of movement with verbatim text. These verbatim-dance works deal with contemporary issues: religious tolerance and intolerance towards sexuality in To Be Straight With You (2007–09), censorship and freedom of speech in Can we Talk About This? (2011–12) and a man's attempt to escape his criminal background and redeem his life in JOHN (2014–15)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lloyd_Newson> .

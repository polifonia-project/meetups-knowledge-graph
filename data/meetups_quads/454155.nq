He was a game show and talk show host and a \"mainstay of Los Angeles’ small theater scene.\" He appeared frequently on several televised game shows from the 1960s through the 1980s and was a longtime panelist on the television game show To Tell the Truth. \"A storyteller par excellence\", he was a favorite of Johnny Carson, appearing on The Tonight Show more than 200 times. In the 1960s, Bean remarked in an interview that he became known as a \"neocelebrity who's famous for being famous\" for his appearances as a panellist on television prime-time gameshows." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orson_Bean> .

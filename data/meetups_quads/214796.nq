<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lizzie_Borden> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lizzie Andrew Borden (July 19, 1860 â€“ June 1, 1927) was an American woman tried and acquitted of the August 4, 1892 axe murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River, Massachusetts. No one else was charged in the murders, and despite ostracism from other residents, Borden spent the remainder of her life in Fall River. She died of pneumonia at age 66, just days before the death of her older sister, Emma. The Borden murders and trial received widespread publicity throughout the United States, and along with Borden herself, they remain a topic in American popular culture to the present day. They have been depicted in numerous films, theatrical productions, literary works, and folk rhymes and are still very well-known in the Fall River area." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lizzie_Borden> .

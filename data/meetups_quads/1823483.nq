<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Majrooh_Sultanpuri> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Asrar ul Hassan Khan (1 October 1919 − 24 May 2000), better known as Majrooh Sultanpuri, was an Indian Urdu poet and lyricist in India's Hindi language film industry. He wrote Hindustani lyrics for numerous Hindi film soundtracks. He was one of the dominating musical forces in Indian cinema in the 1950s and early 1960s, and was an important figure in the Progressive Writers' Movement. He is considered one of the finest avant-garde Urdu poets of 20th century literature. In his career spanning six decades, he worked with many music directors. He won the Filmfare Best Lyricist Award in 1965 for \"Chahunga Main Tujhe\" in the film Dosti, and the highest award in Indian cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for lifetime achievement in 1993. In the 1980s and 1990s, most of his work was with Anand–Milind, their most notable collaborations being Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Lal Dupatta Malmal Ka, Love, Kurbaan and Dahek. He also wrote timeless classics with Jatin-Lalit for films like Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (including the song “Pehla Nasha”) and their debut film Yaara Dildara (including the song “Bin Tere Sanam”), which are both often heard to this day on the Indian musical airwaves." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Majrooh_Sultanpuri> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Thompson_(painter)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bob Thompson (June 26, 1937 â€“ May 30, 1966) was an African-American figurative painter known for his bold and colorful canvases, whose compositions were influenced by the Old Masters. His art has also been described as synthesizing Baroque and Renaissance masterpieces with the jazz-influenced Abstract Expressionist movement. He was prolific in his eight-year career, producing more than 1,000 works before his death in Rome in 1966. The Whitney Museum mounted a retrospective of his work in 1998. He also has works in numerous private and public collections throughout the United States." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Thompson_(painter)> .

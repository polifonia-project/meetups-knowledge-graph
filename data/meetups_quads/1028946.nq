Considered one of the most influential surgeons in medical history. His sudden murder in 1991 stunned Australia, and is considered one of the most notorious in the country's history. Chang was given a state funeral, and in 1999, he was voted Australian of the Century at the People's Choice Awards. After completing his medical studies at the University of Sydney and working in St Vincent's Hospital, he trained in the United Kingdom and the United States as a surgeon before returning to Australia. In St Vincent's Hospital, he helped establish the National Cardiac Transplant Unit, the country's leading centre for heart and lung transplants. Chang's team had a high success rate in performing heart transplantations and he pioneered the development of an artificial heart valve. In 1986, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his \"service to international relations between Australia and China and to medical science\". In 1991, Chang was murdered by two young men in a failed extortion attempt. His legacy includes setting up his own Foundation, the Victor Chang Foundation. Additionally, after his death the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute was created, and the Victor Chang Lowy Packer Building at St Vincent's Hospital was established." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Chang> .

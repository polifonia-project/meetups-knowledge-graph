<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linda_Schuyler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Linda Schuyler, CM OOnt (/ˈskaɪlər/; née Bawcutt; born February 12, 1948) is a Canadian television producer. She is best known for being the co-creator and producer of the Degrassi teen drama franchise, which has spanned five series over four decades. She is a co-founder of Playing With Time, Inc. (with Kit Hood), and of Epitome Pictures (with Stephen Stohn), the production companies involved with the franchise over its 40-year-long history respectively. Born in London, Schuyler immigrated to Canada with her family in the 1950s. As a school teacher, she began creating short films, and formed a creative partnership with television commercial editor Kit Hood. In 1979, Schuyler purchased the rights to adapt the Kay Chorao book Ida Makes A Movie into a film, of which ultimately became the genesis of Degrassi. Schuyler also created Instant Star, another commercially successful Epitome production. Schuyler has received multiple awards and accolades for her work. In 1994, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada, and in 2012, she was made a Member of the Order of Ontario." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linda_Schuyler> .

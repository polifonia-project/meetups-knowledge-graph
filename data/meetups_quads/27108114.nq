<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Terry_Waldo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Terry Waldo (born November 26, 1944) is an American pianist, composer, and historian of early jazz, blues, and stride music, and is best known for his contribution to ragtime and his role in reviving interest in this form, starting in the 1970s. Says Wynton Marsalis in his introduction to Waldo's book: \"He teaches Ragtime, he talks about Ragtime, he plays it, he embodies it, he lives it, and he keeps Ragtime alive.\" The book, This is Ragtime, published in 1976, grew out of the series of the same title that Waldo produced for NPR in 1974. Waldo is also a theatrical music director, producer, vocalist, and teacher. He is noted for his wit and humor in performance, as \"a monologist in the dry, Middle Western tradition.\" Eubie Blake describes his first impression of Waldo's performance thus: \"I died laughing...that's one of the hardest things to doâ€”make people laugh. Terry's ability to do this, combined with his musicianship, actually reminds me of Fats Waller.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Terry_Waldo> .

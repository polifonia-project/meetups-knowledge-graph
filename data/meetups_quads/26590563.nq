With a career spanning nearly three decades covering genres from techno to acid house to minimal, Robert has also been known under the pseudonyms Rob Acid, Acid Warrior, Department of Dance and Sontec amongst many others. He has released a number of well respected records on labels such as Kompakt, Systematic Recordings, , Bedrock, Intec Digital and 's , as well his own labels, Junkfood, Babiczstyle and Dirtcut. He is well known as a live performer rather than a DJ, as he uses synths and live equipment and improvises in every set he plays." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Babicz> .

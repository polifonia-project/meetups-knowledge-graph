<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thom_Gunn> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomson William \"Thom\" Gunn (29 August 1929 – 25 April 2004) was an English poet who was praised for his early verses in England, where he was associated with The Movement, and his later poetry in America, even after moving towards a looser, free-verse style. After relocating from England to San Francisco, Gunn wrote about gay-related topics—particularly in his most famous work, The Man With Night Sweats in 1992—as well as drug use, sex and his bohemian lifestyle. He won major literary awards; his best poems were said to have a compact philosophical elegance." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thom_Gunn> .

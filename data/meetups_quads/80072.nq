<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vandana_Shiva> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vandana Shiva (born 5 November 1952) is an Indian scholar, environmental activist, food sovereignty advocate, ecofeminist and anti-globalisation author. Based in Delhi, Shiva has written more than 20 books. She is often referred to as \"Gandhi of grain\" for her activism associated with the anti-GMO movement. Shiva is one of the leaders and board members of the International Forum on Globalization (with Jerry Mander, Ralph Nader, and Helena Norberg-Hodge), and a figure of the anti-globalisation movement. She has argued in favour of many traditional practices, as in her interview in the book Vedic Ecology (by Ranchor Prime). She is a member of the scientific committee of the Fundacion IDEAS, Spain's Socialist Party's think tank. She is also a member of the International Organization for a Participatory Society." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vandana_Shiva> .

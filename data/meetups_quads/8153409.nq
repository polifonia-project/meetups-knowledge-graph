<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dee_Barnes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Denise \"Dee\" Barnes (stage name Sista D) is an American rapper and former Fox television personality who performed in the West Coast hip hop female duo Body & Soul and hosted a radio show on KDAY, prior to gaining wider fame as the host of Fox's hip hop show Pump It Up!. On January 27, 1991, she was physically assaulted by Dr. Dre at a rap industry party. Barnes filed charges. Dre pled no contest. Despite being the victim, she was blacklisted from the rap industry. A public apology came years later but did not account specifically to the targets of his abuse, including artist Mi'chel'le: \"I apologize to the women I've hurt. I deeply regret what I did and know that it has forever impacted all of our lives.\"Barnes plans on writing a biography of her life, according to a 2019 VIBE Magazine article." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dee_Barnes> .

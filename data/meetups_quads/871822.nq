He was sworn in as the third Chief Minister of Jharkhand on 30 December 2009 after winning the Jharkhand Assembly elections. He resigned on 30 May 2010 after failing to obtain coalition support from the Bharatiya Janata Party, his national party partner. He previously represented the Dumka constituency of Jharkhand in the 14th Lok Sabha, and is the President of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) political party, a constituent of the UPA. On 9 January 2009, Soren was defeated in the by-election for the Tamar assembly constituency by political novice , alias Raja Peter, of the Jharkhand Party by a margin of over 9,000 votes. Soon he contested another by poll after the rebel BJP MLA resigned from his seat in his favour and Soren won the by election from that Jamtara constituency. But the Government could not last longer. In 2009 after the Assembly elections Soren once again formed the Government along with the BJP, and was sworn in as Chief Minister of Jharkhand on 30 December 2009. He was the Minister for Coal in the Union Cabinet in November 2006, when a Delhi district court found him guilty in the murder of his private secretary Shashi Nath Jha in 1994. He has also been indicted in the past on other criminal charges." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shibu_Soren> .

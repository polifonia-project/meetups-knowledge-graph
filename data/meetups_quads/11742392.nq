<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tonino_Baliardo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Antoine \"Tonino\" Baliardo is a French guitarist of Spanish Gitano descent. He is the lead guitarist for Gipsy Kings, a New Flamenco group from France that has sold more than 18 million albums worldwide. He was born in Montpellier. He is the nephew of guitarist Manitas de Plata. Most Gipsy Kings albums have between three and five instrumental cuts - all written by Baliardo; he also co-writes their vocal numbers. After his 2001 solo debut, Essences, Baliardo released an instrumental album under his homonimus name in 2003, of his own originals. \"Tonino is the most creative person in the band,\" said Chico Bouchikhi, a former member who co-wrote their biggest hit to date, \"Bambol√©o\". \"He has lots of ideas and a great imagination. He used to go to school with his guitar.\" Baliardo, like his bandmate Nicolas Reyes, does not read or write musical notation." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tonino_Baliardo> .

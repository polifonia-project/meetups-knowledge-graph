<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Jordan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 â€“ September 16, 2007), better known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was an American author of epic fantasy. He is known best for his series The Wheel of Time (finished by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's death) which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. He is one of several writers to have written original Conan the Barbarian novels; his are considered some of the best of the non-Robert E. Howard efforts by fans. Jordan also published historical fiction using the pseudonym Reagan O'Neal, a western as Jackson O'Reilly, and dance criticism as Chang Lung. Jordan claimed to have ghostwritten an \"international thriller\" that is still believed to have been written by someone else." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Jordan> .

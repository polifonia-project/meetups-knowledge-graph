<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olly_Wilson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Olly Woodrow Wilson, Jr. (September 7, 1937 â€“ March 12, 2018) was an American composer of contemporary classical music, pianist, double bassist, and a musicologist. He was one of the most preeminent composers of African American descent in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. He is known for developing a list of Heterogenous Sound Ideals that is widely used to dissect different aspects of music, with an emphasis on African culture. According to Wilson himself, \"The essence of Africanness consists of a way of doing something, not simply something that is done\" (1991). This motto is the basis of Wilson's work in the realm of ethnomusicology. He is also known for establishing the TIMARA (Technology in Music and Related Arts) program at Oberlin Conservatory, the first-ever conservatory program in electronic music. Olly's richly varied musical background included not only traditional compositions and academic disciplines, but also his professional experience as a jazz and orchestral musician, work in electronic media, and studies of African music in West Africa itself." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olly_Wilson> .

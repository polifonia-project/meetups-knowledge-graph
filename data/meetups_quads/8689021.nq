Initially deployed as a left winger in the early stages of his career, Boyd was used more frequently in an attacking midfield role as his career progressed. Boyd started his career in the youth academy at Charlton Athletic, before joining Stevenage Borough of the Football Conference in 2001. He made his first-team debut for Stevenage in 2002, aged 17, and spent five years there, scoring over thirty goals. He signed for League Two club Peterborough United for a fee of £260,000 in January 2007, and won successive promotions in the 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons. He joined Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the 2009–10 season. He returned to Peterborough and was part of the team that won promotion back to the Championship during the 2010–11 season. A loan move to Hull City followed for the remainder of the 2012–13 season, helping the club earn promotion back to the Premier League during the three-month agreement. The move was made permanent and he would go on to be a part of the Hull team that made the FA Cup final in 2014. He signed for Burnley, also of the Premier League, in September 2014, where he spent three seasons. During this time, Boyd gained coverage for his running statistics, running the highest average distance per game in the Premier League during the 2014–15 season. He helped Burnley back to the Premier League during the 2015–16 season. Boyd subsequently joined Sheffield Wednesday in July 2017 and made 50 appearances over two seasons there. He returned to Peterborough United for the 2019–20 season and then spent the following season at Salford City of League Two. Boyd announced his retirement from playing professional football in October 2021. He also played for the England National Game XI team, who represent England at non-League level, from 2005 to 2006, earning six caps and scoring one goal. Boyd qualified to play for Scotland through his maternal grandfather. After playing for the Scotland B team in 2009, he earned his first cap at senior level in 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Boyd_(footballer)> .

Greenlee was educated at Iowa State University where he received his B.A. in 1963 and M.A. in 1968. Decades later, in 1997, Iowa State initiated the Greenlee School of Journalism and Mass Communication in response to a large donation. After a career in advertising, Bob, with wife Diane, moved to Boulder, Colorado in 1975 and bought radio station KADE. In 1978, the Greenlees launched and developed the very successful KBCO, an FM station programming adult album alternative (AAA) format, which they sold in 1988 for $27M to Noble Broadcasting, now part of the iHeartRadio conglomerate. Greenlee also co-founded what would become CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries, of which he is still a board member. He is president of Centennial Investment & Management Company, Inc., a Boulder-based venture capital and real estate firm. Greenlee was the Republican mayor of Boulder from 1998 to 1999 and city council member from 1983-1999. In 1998, he ran a narrowly unsuccessfully race as a moderate pro-choice Republican against Mark Udall in 1998 for Colorado's 2nd Congressional District. In late December 2016, Greenlee was seriously injured when he caused a highway accident in southern Colorado involving 5 vehicles. Another driver was killed and two other people were injured. Greenlee was driving the SUV at 89 MPH that apparently started the chain reaction. Greenlee and his wife, Diane, have two children." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Greenlee> .

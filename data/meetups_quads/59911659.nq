A strong big man who primarily played as a center, he was one of the top prospects in the 1981 high school class. He was a 4-year starter playing college basketball for the Florida Gators, and he was a 3rd-round pick in the 1985 NBA Draft; however, he never played in the NBA and he had a 7-year career playing professional basketball in Europe (Italy, Spain and Turkey) and in the CBA. He died in 1995 of an enlarged heart. He was inducted in the SEC Hall of Fame in 2009." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eugene_McDowell> .

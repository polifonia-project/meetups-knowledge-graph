<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kirk_Watson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kirk Preston Watson (born March 18, 1958) is an American attorney and politician from Austin, Texas. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as Mayor of Austin from 1997 to 2001. He ran unsuccessfully for Texas Attorney General in the 2002 election, when he was defeated by Republican Greg Abbott, later governor of Texas. In 2006, Watson was elected to the Texas Senate from District 14. In 2011, Watson was chosen by his Democratic colleagues to chair the Senate Democratic Caucus and served until 2015. On the first day of the 86th Legislature, he was chosen by his colleagues—Democrats and Republicans—to serve as president pro tempore. The position typically goes to the most senior member, regardless of party, who has not yet served as President Pro Tem, and is second in line of succession to the Governor. It was announced by the Austin American-Statesman that Watson planned to resign from the Texas State Senate to become the first dean of the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs. His resignation was effective April 30, 2020. He is currently running in the 2022 Austin mayoral election to become Mayor of Austin for the second time." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kirk_Watson> .

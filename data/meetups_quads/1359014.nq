<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guy_Johnson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Guy Johnson (c. 1740 â€“ 5 March 1788) was an Irish military officer and diplomat. He served on the side of the British during the Revolutionary War, having migrated to the Province of New York as a young man and worked with his uncle, Sir William Johnson who served as the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the northern colonies. Guy was appointed as William's successor in 1774. The following year, Johnson relocated with Loyalist supporters to Canada as tensions rose in New York during the American Revolution. He directed joint militia and Mohawk military actions in the Mohawk Valley. Accused of falsifying reports, he went to London to defend himself after the war, and died there in 1788." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guy_Johnson> .

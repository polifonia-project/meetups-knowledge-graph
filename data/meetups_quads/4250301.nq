In an 18-year career in the Premier League and the English Football League, he made 550 competitive appearances for six different clubs. He both captained a team and scored a goal in each of the top four divisions of English football. He also gained 41 caps for Wales in a ten-year international career, captaining the side once, before he retired from international football in September 2006. A defender, he began his career with Watford in 1993, whom he would captain to two promotions, winning the Second Division title in 1997–98 and the First Division play-off final in 1999. He went on to be voted the club's Player of the Season in their 1999–2000 Premier League campaign. He was sold to Sheffield United for a £350,000 fee in September 2001 and helped the club to reach the First Division play-off final in 2003, as well the semi-finals of the FA Cup and League Cup. He signed with Cardiff City in July 2004, before moving on to Coventry City in February 2005. He joined Huddersfield Town in January 2008, before moving on to Chesterfield in May 2008 and announcing his retirement in March 2011. He worked as a coach at Port Vale for three years before he was appointed as manager, initially on a caretaker basis, in September 2014. In May 2016, he was appointed manager of Northampton Town on a three-year contract, but was sacked in January 2017. He was appointed Wales under-21 manager two months later, before becoming assistant manager for the senior team, led by Ryan Giggs, in August 2019. He became the team's caretaker manager in November 2020, when Giggs was suspended from duty, and oversaw two victories in the UEFA Nations League that secured Wales promotion into League A. He coached Wales at UEFA Euro 2020, where they would reach the Round of 16. In June 2022, he led Wales to qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the country's first World Cup appearance since 1958." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rob_Page> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Houseman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Houseman (born Jacques Haussmann; September 22, 1902 â€“ October 31, 1988) was a Romanian-born British-American actor and producer of theatre, film, and television. He became known for his highly publicized collaboration with director Orson Welles from their days in the Federal Theatre Project through to the production of Citizen Kane and his collaboration, as producer of The Blue Dahlia, with writer Raymond Chandler on the screenplay. He is perhaps best known for his role as Professor Charles W. Kingsfield in the film The Paper Chase (1973), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He reprised his role as Kingsfield in the 1978 television series adaptation. Houseman was also known for his commercials for the brokerage firm Smith Barney. He had a distinctive English accent, a product of his schooling." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Houseman> .

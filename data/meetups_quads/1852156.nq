He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from 1956 through 1967. Sanford was notable for the meteoric start to his career when, he led the National League with 188 strikeouts as a 28-year-old rookie for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1957. He later became a 20-game-winner and made his only World Series appearance as a member of the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the California Angels and the Kansas City Athletics." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_Sanford> .

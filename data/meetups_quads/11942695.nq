<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herman_Wright> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Herman Wright was a jazz bassist. He was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1932, and, in 1960, moved to New York City, where he resided until his death in 1997. He began on drums as a teen before ultimately settling on upright bass. He worked with Dorothy Ashby, Terry Gibbs, beat poet Allen Ginsberg, Yusef Lateef, George Shearing, Doug Watkins and on one occasion substituted Charles Mingus when the latter wanted to play piano. He can also be heard on Allen Ginsberg's Ginsberg Sings Blake. He had three sons, Herman Wright Jr. (brass and woodwinds), Paris Wright (drums), and Dewayne Wright (piano)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herman_Wright> .

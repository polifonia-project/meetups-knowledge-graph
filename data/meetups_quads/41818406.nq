Basnet debuted as a film director with the crime-thriller Loot, which earned 25.5 million Nepalese rupees (NPR) and became a \"cult classic\" and the highest grossing Nepali film ever. After his successful debut as a director, he debuted as an actor in Uma (2013). Basnet later directed the dark comedy Talakjung vs Tulke, which was critically acclaimed and commercially successful. The film was selected as the Nepalese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.

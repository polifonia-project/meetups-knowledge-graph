<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Webster_(opera_manager)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir David Lumsden Webster KCVO Kt FRCM (3 July 1903 â€“ 9 May 1971) was the chief executive of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, from 1945 to 1970. He played a key part in the establishment of the Royal Ballet and Royal Opera companies. From a retail background, Webster became chairman of the Liverpool Philharmonic during the Second World War. From there he was asked to set up opera and ballet companies at Covent Garden. He persuaded the existing Sadler's Wells Ballet to move to the opera house but found no established opera company suitable to do the same, and he set up a new opera company from scratch. At first, Webster presented opera in English with a permanent company, but as Covent Garden flourished and international stars were attracted to appear, the policy gradually changed to presenting operas in their original language. By the time of Webster's retirement, the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet were world-famous." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Webster_(opera_manager)> .

The band's single \"Brother Louie\" rose to No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in August 1973. In 1971, Michael Brown and Ian Lloyd formed Stories. They released two albums (Stories and About Us) with a handful of Billboard Top 100 charting singles. Brown left before the band recorded their third (and final) album, Traveling Underground, which was released under the name, Ian Lloyd and Stories, and included the Billboard #50 hit \"Mammy Blue\". After Stories, he pursued a solo career, with six albums to his credit. Lloyd has performed with numerous recording artists, assuming the role of a session musician. His long discography of work includes background vocal work with artists such as Foreigner, Billy Joel, Peter Frampton, and Yes. Lloyd continues to record, perform, and write, his most recent release being \"Everybody's Happy 'Cause It's Christmas Time\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ian_Lloyd_(musician)> .

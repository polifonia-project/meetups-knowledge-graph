<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Fleming_(writer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Fleming (2 January 1940 â€“ 29 November 2010) was an economist, cultural historian and writer on environmental issues, based in London. He was among the first to reveal the possibility of peak oil's approach and invented the influential TEQs system, designed to address this and climate change. He was also a pioneer of post-growth economics, and a significant figure in the development of the UK Green Party, the Transition Towns movement and the New Economics Foundation, as well as a Chairman of the Soil Association. Alongside these roles, his wide-ranging independent analysis culminated in two critically acclaimed books, and (published posthumously in 2016). A feature film about his perspective and legacy, The Sequel: What Will Follow Our Troubled Civilisation?, was released in 2020, directed by Peter William Armstrong." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Fleming_(writer)> .

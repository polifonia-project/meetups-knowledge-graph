<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cameron_Mooney> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Cameron Mooney (born 26 September 1979) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the North Melbourne and Geelong Football Clubs in the Australian Football League (AFL). A forward, 1.97 metres (6 ft 6 in) tall and weighing 99 kilograms (218 lb), Mooney is renowned for his passion, as well as his poor tribunal history where he holds the record for the most suspensions in a single season by a VFL/AFL player. Mooney was selected in the 2007 All-Australian Team, and was part of Geelong's AFL premiership-winning team in the same year. He also represented the Dream Team state team in the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match in 2008, as well as being the leading goalkicker for Geelong in 2007." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cameron_Mooney> .

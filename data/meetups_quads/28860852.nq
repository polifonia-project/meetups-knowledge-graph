<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giuseppe_Campanari> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Giuseppe Campanari (17 November 1855 â€“ 31 May 1927) was an Italian-born operatic baritone and cellist. He later became an American citizen. Campanari performed initially as a cellist at Milan's La Scala and on tour in other parts of Europe, but he later emigrated to the United States, where he played first solo cello for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and was subsequently appointed professor of cello at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. He resigned from both positions to devote himself to singing, which he had studied as a second 'instrument' for years, becoming a major opera star with the Metropolitan Opera. In addition, he appeared at most of the major opera houses in Europe, including several seasons spent at the Royal Opera in London's Covent Garden, and participated in concert tours with the great sopranos Nordica, Sembrich, Melba and Eames." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giuseppe_Campanari> .

She is a graduate of Sussex University who trained at East 15 Acting School. De Angelis began her career in the 1980s as an actress with the theatre company. In 1987, her play Breathless was a prize winner at the 1987 Second Wave Young Women's Writing Festival. Her plays often feature historical figures. Playhouse Creatures and A Laughing Matter are set in the London theatrical milieu of the 17th and 18th centuries respectively. Wanderlust examines Victorian colonialism and Ironmistress is a verse play exploring Lady Charlotte Guest's factory ownership. As a librettist, De Angelis contributed to the opera The Silent Twins (2007), composed by Errollyn Wallen, which is based on the case of June and Jennifer Gibbons. De Angelis tends to write to commission and several of her plays have been produced by Max Stafford-Clark's Out of Joint theatre company." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/April_De_Angelis> .

At a young age, Fortuna took an interest in music and at the age of 11, wrote his first song, which led him to discover his talent in music and writing. At the age of 15, he created his own recording studio in his home where he was able to begin his journey of further exploring his musical talent. In August 2011, Fortuna participated in Red Bull Talento de Calle singing competition, where he landed in the top 10. Now, in 2012, this young talented individual received the support of Emiliano Vasquez (CEO of EVT Music), whom he signed with and joined the EVT Music/ Sony Music collection of artists.

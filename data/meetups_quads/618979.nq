<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Buscema> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Buscema (/bjuːˈsɛmə/; Italian: [buʃˈʃɛːma]; born Giovanni Natale Buscema, December 11, 1927 – January 10, 2002) was an American comic book artist and one of the mainstays of Marvel Comics during its 1960s and 1970s ascendancy into an industry leader and its subsequent expansion to a major pop-culture conglomerate. His younger brother Sal Buscema is also a comic book artist. Buscema is best known for his run on the series The Avengers and The Silver Surfer, and for over 200 stories featuring the sword-and-sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. In addition, he pencilled at least one issue of nearly every major Marvel title, including long runs on two of the company's top magazines, Fantastic Four and Thor. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2002." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Buscema> .

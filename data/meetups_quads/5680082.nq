<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perez_Hilton> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mario Armando Lavandeira Jr. (born March 23, 1978), known professionally as Perez Hilton, is an American blogger, columnist, and media personality. His blog is known for posts covering gossip items about celebrities, and for posting tabloid photos over which he has added his own captions or \"doodles\". His blog has garnered controversy for its attitude, its former practice of outing alleged closeted celebrities, and its role in the increasing coverage of celebrities in all forms of media. In addition to his blogging, Hilton has written four books, hosts a podcast with Chris Booker, runs two YouTube channels, has appeared in various films and television shows, and has acted in two off-Broadway shows. In 2018, he was dubbed \"the original celebrity social media influencer\" by BroadwayWorld." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perez_Hilton> .

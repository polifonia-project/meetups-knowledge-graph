<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Morrison> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tommy \"The Duke\" Morrison (January 2, 1969 â€“ September 1, 2013) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1988 to 2008, and held the WBO heavyweight title in 1993. He retired from boxing in 1996 when he tested positive for HIV. Morrison is also known for his acting career, having starred alongside Sylvester Stallone in the 1990 film Rocky V as Tommy Gunn. Morrison had previously attempted a comeback to boxing in 2007 when the Nevada commission lifted the indefinite worldwide suspension in July 2006. In August 2013, Morrison's mother announced that her son was in the final stages of AIDS, and he died on September 1, 2013 at the age of 44 from sepsis, septic shock, multi-system organ failure and, ultimately, cardiac arrest." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Morrison> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Howard_Paul> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "George Henry Howard Paul (18 November 1830 â€“ 9 December 1905), known on stage as Howard Paul, was an American writer, playwright, comic actor and theatrical manager who made his name and spent most of his career in the United Kingdom. In 1854 he married the British singer and actress Isabella Hill, and the two appeared together in Britain and the United States as Mr and Mrs Howard Paul for more than two decades, in comic pieces written by Paul. The couple separated around 1877, after he began an affair with the actress Letty Lind. After that affair ended, Paul continued to write through the 1880s and acted as a theatre manager in Britain." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Howard_Paul> .

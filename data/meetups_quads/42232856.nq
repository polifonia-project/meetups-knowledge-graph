Voters elected Shaw to the New Zealand parliament at the 2014 general election as a list representative of the Green Party. The party selected Shaw as its male co-leader in May 2015. Following Metiria Turei's resignation in August 2017, Shaw became the party's sole leader for the duration of the 2017 general election. In October 2017 the Green Party agreed to support a Labour-led government. Shaw became the Minister of Statistics, Minister for Climate Change and Associate Minister of Finance (outside Cabinet). Following the 2020 general election, the Greens agreed to cooperate with the Labour majority government, and Shaw was re-appointed as the Minister for Climate Change." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Shaw_(New_Zealand_politician)> .

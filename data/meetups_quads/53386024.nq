After Tommy Moore left the group in June 1960, Chapman joined the Silver Beetles. However, Chapman only played three shows with the group in June 1960 before he left due to being called up for national service. He was replaced in the group by Pete Best. After finishing his time in the national service he played with several local bands, including Ernie Mack and The Saturated Seven. Chapman died of cancer in July 1995 at the age of 58." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norman_Chapman> .

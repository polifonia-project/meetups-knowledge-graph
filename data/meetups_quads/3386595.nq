<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hill_Hewitt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Hill Hewitt (July 11, 1801, New York City â€” October 7, 1890, Baltimore) was an American composer, playwright, and poet. He is best known for his songs about the American South, including \"A Minstrel's Return from the War\", \"The Soldier's Farewell\", \"The Stonewall Quickstep\", and \"Somebody's Darling\". His output during the American Civil War earned him the epithets \"Bard of the Stars and Bars\" and \"Bard of the Confederacy\". Over his career, Hewitt wrote over 300 songs, a number of cantatas and operettas, and one oratorio, as well as plays, poems, and articles for magazines and newspapers. He also worked as a theatre manager, magazine and newspaper editor, concert performer, and music teacher at seminaries for women." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Hill_Hewitt> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Veeck> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Louis Veeck Jr. (/ˈvɛk/ VECK; February 9, 1914 – January 2, 1986), also known as \"Sport Shirt Bill\", was an American Major League Baseball franchise owner and promoter. Veeck was at various times the owner of the Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns and Chicago White Sox. As owner and team president of the Indians in 1947, Veeck signed Larry Doby, thus beginning the integration of the American League, and the following year won a World Series title as Cleveland's owner/president. Veeck was the last owner to purchase a baseball franchise without an independent fortune, and is responsible for many innovations and contributions to baseball. Unable to compete in the new era of salary escalation ignited by arbitration and free agency, Veeck sold his ownership interests after the 1980 Chicago White Sox season. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_Veeck> .

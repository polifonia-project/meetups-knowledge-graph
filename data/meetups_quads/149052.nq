His 2000 film Chicken Run is the highest-grossing stop motion animated film. For his work in animation, in 2012, Park was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of Blake's most famous artwork—the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Park> .

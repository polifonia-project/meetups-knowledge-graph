<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikola_Gruevski> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nikola Gruevski (Macedonian: Никола Груевски, pronounced [ni'kɔla ɡru'ɛfski]; Hungarian: Nikola Gruevszki; born 31 August 1970) is a Macedonian politician who served as Prime Minister of Macedonia from 2006 until his resignation, which was caused by the 2016 Macedonian protests, and led the VMRO-DPMNE party from 2004 to 2017. Under the Pržino Agreement mediated by the European Union, Gruevski agreed to resign and left his post on 18 January 2016. In May 2018 he was sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges. In November 2018 he was ordered to serve his sentence but failed to check-in with authorities and instead fled to Hungary, where he sought and was granted political asylum. He has been accused of promoting the controversial identity politics called antiquization. Under his leadership the country which had pro-European and pro-NATO policy, has changed sides to pro-Russian, pro-Serbian and anti-Western one. He has opposed to the Friendship treaty signed with Bulgaria in 2017 and the Prespa agreement signed with Greece in 2018, despite both neighboring states being NATO and EU members. In April 2022, he was added to the US Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals List of individuals facing Balkans-related sanctions. Also in April, he was sentenced in Skopje to 7 years in prison on charges of money laundering and illegal acquisition and concealment of state property." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikola_Gruevski> .

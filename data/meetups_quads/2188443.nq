His body of work includes supporting work in big-budget mainstream productions and starring roles in independent projects in both the American and the British film industries. He has received several accolades, including nominations for a British Academy Film Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. He appeared in the 2012 edition of Forbes 30 Under 30. Hoult was drawn to acting from a young age and appeared in local theatre productions as a child. He made his screen debut at age seven in the 1996 film Intimate Relations, and appeared in several television programmes between 1998 and 2001. His breakthrough came with the 2002 comedy-drama About a Boy. He achieved wider recognition for his performance as Tony Stonem in the E4 teen series Skins (2007–2008). His transition to adult roles began with the 2009 drama film A Single Man, for which he earned a BAFTA Rising Star Award nomination, and the fantasy film Clash of the Titans (2010). He played the mutant Hank McCoy in the 2011 superhero film X-Men: First Class, a role he reprised in later instalments of the series. Hoult starred as a zombie in the romantic comedy Warm Bodies (2013), and had a supporting role in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). He starred in a number of independent films before portraying various historical figures such as Robert Harley in the black comedy The Favourite (2018), writer J. R. R. Tolkien in Tolkien (2019), and Peter III in the Hulu comedy-drama series The Great (2020–present). The lattermost earned him nominations for two Golden Globes and a Primetime Emmy Award. Hoult has since starred in the black comedy The Menu (2022). Outside of film, Hoult voiced Elliot in Lionhead Studios' 2010 action role-playing game Fable III, appeared in the 2009 West End play New Boy, and is involved in philanthropy, supporting such charitable organisations as Teenage Cancer Trust and Christian Aid." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_Hoult> .

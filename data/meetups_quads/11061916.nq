<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calvin_Johnson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Calvin Johnson Jr., (born September 29, 1985) is an American former football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons with the Detroit Lions. He played college football at Georgia Tech, where he twice received first-team All-American honors, and was selected by the Lions second overall in the 2007 NFL Draft. Nicknamed \"Megatron\" after the Transformers character of the same name, he is regarded as one of the greatest wide receivers of all time. Johnson was noted for having a rare combination of size (6 ft 5 in and 239 lbs), catching ability, speed (40-yard dash in 4.35 seconds), strength, leaping ability, and body control. In 2012, he set the NFL season record for receiving yards. Johnson is also tied with Michael Irvin for 100-yard games in a season, tied with Adam Thielen for consecutive 100-yard games, and holds the record for consecutive games with 10 or more receptions. He appeared in six consecutive Pro Bowls from 2010 to 2015 and received three consecutive first-team All-Pro selections from 2011 to 2013. While still regarded as being in his prime, Johnson retired after the 2015 season, citing a loss of passion for the game due to health concerns and the Lions' lack of overall success during his tenure. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2018 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Calvin_Johnson> .

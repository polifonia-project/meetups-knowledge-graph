<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Stevens> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anthony Stevens (born 2 July 1971) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the North Melbourne Kangaroos. He was named as ruck rover in the club's official 'Team of the Century'. Stevens was a member of North Melbourne premiership sides in 1996 and 1999. In 1998, he was an All-Australian; additionally, in the same year, he represented Victoria at State of Origin football. He was a Best and Fairest winner for his club twice, in 1997 and 1999. Stevens lost two litres of blood and had two operations after injuries caused when falling glass hit Stevens outside the Redback Brewery Hotel in North Melbourne on 11 March 2000. Stevens suffered a 20-centimetre gash from the corner of his mouth along his right cheek and down the side of his mouth. In 2002, he was involved in a much-publicised controversy involving Wayne Carey after it was revealed that Carey had been having an extramarital affair with his wife Kelli Stevens. The condemnation from Anthony Stevens and his teammates caused Carey to resign from the North Melbourne Football Club. Stevens retired at the end of the 2004 season, but he and former Kangaroos teammate Glenn Archer got together to play one match for the Caulfield Grammarians Football Club. After he retired from the AFL, Stevens accepted an ambassadorship with the VCFL. He played with Benalla in the Goulburn Valley Football League for a number of years." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Stevens> .

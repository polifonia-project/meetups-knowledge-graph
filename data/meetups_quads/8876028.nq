He was a prominent member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or the \"Wobblies\"), a left-wing trade union which was influential during his time. In an era when few African Americans were permitted in American unions and fewer still belonged to more left-wing organizations, Fletcher was nationally known. Fletcher co-founded and helped lead the interracial Local 8 branch of the IWW’s Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Fletcher> .

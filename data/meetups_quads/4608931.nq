<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shao_Kang> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shao Kang (Chinese: 少康; pinyin: Shào Kāng, his surname was Sì 姒) was the sixth king of the Xia dynasty of ancient China. He was the son of Xiang. His father was killed in a battle against Han Zhuo's two sons, Han Jiao and Han Yi; Shao Kang's mother Ji managed to escape and had him after a few months. After he grew up, Shao Kang and his followers engaged in a battle against Han Zhuo, defeated and killed him, and restored the Xia Dynasty. He was succeeded as king by his son Zhu; another son was traditionally credited with civilizing the Yue of Zhejiang and establishing the state of Yue at Kuaiji. Shao Kang is sometimes identified with Du Kang, the legendary inventor of wine in Chinese mythology." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shao_Kang> .

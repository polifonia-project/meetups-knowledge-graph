He is the only person ever to have represented South Africa at the Winter Paralympic Games, and he is one of only two Africans (along with Ugandan Tofiri Kibuuka) to have competed at the Games to date. Warner lost a leg in a car crash in 1988. Having previously intended to make a career in hockey, he subsequently embarked on a career in skiing. In addition to the Paralympic Games, he has competed in events such as the Disabled World Championships. He is an electrical engineer by profession." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Warner> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_McKay> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Kenneth McManus (September 24, 1921 – June 7, 2008), better known professionally as Jim McKay, was an American television sports journalist. McKay was best known for hosting ABC's Wide World of Sports (1961–1998). His introduction for that program has passed into American pop culture, in which viewers were reminded of the show's mission (\"Spanning the globe to bring you the constant variety of sports\") and what lay ahead (\"the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\"). He is also known for television coverage of 12 Olympic Games, and is universally respected for his memorable reporting on the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. McKay covered a wide variety of special events, including horse races such as the Kentucky Derby, golf events such as the British Open, and the Indianapolis 500. McKay's son, Sean McManus, a protégé of Roone Arledge, is the chairman of CBS Sports." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_McKay> .

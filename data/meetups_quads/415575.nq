<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edith_Wilson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edith Wilson (née Bolling, formerly Galt; October 15, 1872 – December 28, 1961) was the first lady of the United States from 1915 to 1921 and the second wife of President Woodrow Wilson. She married the widower Wilson in December 1915, during his first term as president. Edith Wilson played an influential role in President Wilson's administration following the severe stroke he suffered in October 1919. For the remainder of her husband's presidency, she managed the office of the president, a role she later described as a \"stewardship,\" and determined which communications and matters of state were important enough to bring to the attention of the bedridden president." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edith_Wilson> .

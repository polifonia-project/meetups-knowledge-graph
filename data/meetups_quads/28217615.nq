Armour (born May 15, 1984), better known by his stage name Johnny Polygon, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and music producer. Raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Polygon would meet American producer DJ Green Lantern in 2008, who offered him a record deal with his label imprint, Invasion Music Group. In 2009, Polygon released his first project under the label, an extended play (EP) titled Group Hug, which URB Magazine called \"risky yet authentic.\" In 2010, Polygon followed his EP with Rebel Without Applause, his first official mixtape, which included the promotional single, \"The Riot Song\". The single went on to be featured on MTV, VH1 and Centric, as well as the HBO television series, How to Make it in America. Johnny Polygon has worked with high-profile musicians such as Nas and Kid Cudi. He frequently collaborates with his longtime friend and fellow Oklahoman Gabriel Royal, and has also worked with Amanda Diva, Dead Prez and Yelawolf. In 2012, MSN.com named Polygon one of their \"Top 5 Up-And-Comers You Should Know.\" Since 2001, Polygon has released ten studio albums, with his latest being Teddy Bear Massacre 2 (2022). Polygon is also looking to new opportunities with Armatura Production Haus, a new endeavor that will umbrella various multimedia projects: music video production, television, film, and a new children’s books he's working on. “It’s just a fan-funded production company,” he said. “My label is my fans.”" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Polygon> .

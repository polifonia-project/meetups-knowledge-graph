He has been a most prolific contributor to the journal Nuytsia, contributing to the first issue in 1970 and to the 12th volume in 1998, which was dedicated to him for his contributions to plant taxonomy and to celebrate his 70th birthday. Since his retirement from the Western Australian Herbarium in 1993, he has helped to maintain a comprehensive census of the flora of Western Australia. Wilson has mostly published papers dealing with the plant families Rutaceae, Asteraceae and Chenopodiaceae." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Graham_Wilson> .

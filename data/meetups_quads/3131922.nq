<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Collins_(Australian_musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Collins (born 27 April 1970) is the mainstay bass guitarist for Australian rock band Powderfinger since 1989. He is one of the founding members of the band, along with guitarist Ian Haug, forming at their high school, Brisbane Grammar School, as a three-piece. Powderfinger has released seven studio albums, a greatest-hits album, and a double CD live album. After they released their first best-of album, Fingerprints, in 2004, they decided to take a break. During the hiatus, Collins played with fellow Powderfinger member Darren Middleton in his new band Drag on a number of occasions as well as performing with Ian Haug and Steven Bishop in The Predators. Collins is often referred to as \"J.C.\" by his fellow band members, as they are his initials and to distinguish him from the group's drummer Jon Coghill. Initially, the nickname was given to him following the group's song \"JC\" from their second album, Double Allergic, which referred to Jesus Christ." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Collins_(Australian_musician)> .

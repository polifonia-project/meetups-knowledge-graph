<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_J._B._Wilson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John J. B. Wilson (born May 24, 1954) is an American copywriter and publicist. He majored in film and television at University of California, Los Angeles, and after graduation worked on film marketing campaigns. Wilson is the co-founder of the Golden Raspberry Awards (also known as the Razzies) along with Mo Murphy, an annual ceremony dedicated to \"honoring\" the worst in film. In 1981, while hosting a potluck dinner at his house on the night of the Academy Awards, Wilson invited his friends to give impromptu award presentations in his living room. The following year, Los Angeles Daily News covered the event, the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards, and from behind a cardboard podium Wilson announced the Village People feature film Can't Stop the Music as the first Razzie Award for Worst Picture. Attendance doubled at Razzie award ceremonies in the following years, and by the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards the event received coverage from CNN and two major news wires. Wilson has retained an active role in the awards, and is referred to as the \"Head Razzberry\". His book The Official Razzie Movie Guide was published in 2005 for the 25th anniversary of the Razzie Awards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_J._B._Wilson> .

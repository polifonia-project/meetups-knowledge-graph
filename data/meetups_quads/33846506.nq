Woods, who was an early blues pioneer in lap steel, slide guitar playing, recorded thirty-five tracks between 1930 and 1940. He recorded solo and as part of a duo, the Shreveport Home Wreckers, and with a six- or seven-piece group, the Wampus Cats. Early in his career he backed Jimmie Davis on some of his recordings. Woods's best-known song was \"Lone Wolf Blues\", from which came his billing as \"The Lone Wolf\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oscar_%22Buddy%22_Woods> .

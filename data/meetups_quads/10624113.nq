They include 2000's critically acclaimed Guitar Lullaby, out on Ellipsis Arts and Latin American Guitar Music, out on Naxos. Cobo has also recorded Leo Brouwer's 3rd and 4th guitar concertos, and his performance of Brouwer's \"Concerto de Toronto\" with the San Antonio Symphony was called \"extrovert, lyrical and rhythmically alive...Cobo's performance was characterized by generosity of spirit, to say nothing of knockout virtuosity.\" Cobo's virtuosity is widely recognized, and in 2012, partnered with him to create a signature \"Ricardo Cobo\" guitar. Cobo can be seen performing on his Alhambra on the guitar-maker's website.

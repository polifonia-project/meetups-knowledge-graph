She is known for her work in independent productions and has received numerous accolades, including a British Academy Television Award, a British Independent Film Award and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a British Academy Film Award. Morton was a member of the Central Junior Television Workshop in her native Nottingham and began her career in British television in 1991. She guest-starred in four episodes of Soldier Soldier that year, two episodes of Cracker in 1994, and one episode of Peak Practice that same year. She had a bigger role, a dozen episodes, in the ITV series Band of Gold (1995–1996). Morton made the transition to film with lead roles in the dramas Emma (1996), Jane Eyre (1997), and the well-received Under the Skin (1997). She also starred alongside Max Beesley in BBC's mini series production of The History of Tom Jones: a Foundling in 1997 to critical acclaim. The next year, Woody Allen cast Morton in Sweet and Lowdown (1999), which earned her nominations for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Established as a prominent force on the independent film scene by the early 2000s, Morton starred in Morvern Callar (2002), which garnered her the BIFA Award for Best Actress, and she received her second Academy Award nomination for her performance in In America (2003), this time for Best Actress. Her role in the commercially successful sci-fi thriller Minority Report (2002) was followed by biographical portrayals of Myra Hindley in Longford (2006), Deborah Curtis in Control (2007), and Mary, Queen of Scots in Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007). For her role in Longford, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

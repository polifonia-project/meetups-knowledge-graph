<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Corps_Malade> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Fabien Marsaud (born 31 July 1977), known professionally as Grand Corps Malade (GCM), is a French slam poet and lyricist. He has released seven studio albums so far, all of them reaching top-five status on the French SNEP chart. GCM started writing and performing a capella at slam events in 2003. Three years later, he signed with Universal's AZ affiliate and released his debut album Midi 20, which became a top-ten selling record of the year in France. Grand Corps Malade's follow-up album, Enfant de la ville (2008), and third album 3ème temps (2010), were less successful commercially. In 2013, he released his family-inspired Funambule album, while Il nous restera ça (2015) featured 11 collaborations with other musicians. His sixth album, Plan B (2018), reached number two on the SNEP album chart. In 2020, he released Mesdames (Ladies), featuring ten duets with women, which topped the French charts. Its lead single, \"Mais je t'aime\" (But I love you), a duet with Camille Lellouche, became his highest-ranking song on the French singles chart. GCM's accolades include three Victories of Music awarded by the French Ministry of Culture. His stage name means \"tall, sick body\" in French, a reference to his height (nearly 6'4\" or 1.94m) and to a spinal injury that forces him to walk with a crutch, due to a diving accident in 1997 that initially led doctors to tell him he would never walk again." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grand_Corps_Malade> .

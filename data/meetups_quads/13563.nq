<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herman_Brood> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hermanus \"Herman\" Brood (Dutch pronunciation: [ɦɛrˈmaːnɵs ˈɦɛrmɑn ˈbroːt]; 5 November 1946 – 11 July 2001) was a Dutch musician, painter, actor and poet. As a musician he achieved artistic and commercial success in the 1970s and 1980s, and was called \"the greatest and only Dutch rock 'n' roll star\". Later in life he started a successful career as a painter. Known for his hedonistic lifestyle of \"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll\", Brood was an enfant terrible and a cultural figure whose suicide by jumping from a hotel roof, apparently influenced by a failure to kick his drug and alcohol habit, strengthened his controversial status; according to a poll organised to celebrate fifty years of Dutch popular music, it was the most significant event in its history." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herman_Brood> .

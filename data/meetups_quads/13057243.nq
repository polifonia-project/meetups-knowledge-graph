<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ruby_Neri> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ruby Rose Neri (born 1970) is an American artist based in Los Angeles, California. She was born and raised in California's Bay Area, drawing creative influence from her parents and their friends. Her father is Manuel Neri, a prolific sculptor associated with the Bay Area Figurative Movement, and her mother, Susan Neri, is a graphic designer. Neri is both a painter and a sculptor, and has worked with a wide array of materials including clay, plaster, bronze, steel, fiberglass, glaze, acrylic, oil, and spray paint.[8] Lately, Neri has focused her practice and is primarily making clay sculpture.[7] Her work is based in abstraction and figuration, drawing inspiration from Bay Area Figuration, German Expressionism, graffiti, and folk art. Neri uses horses as a common motif in her work, which serves as a personal symbol of her youth. Reminisce (aka REM, pseudonyms of Ruby Rose Neri) is a sculptor, painter, and former street artist from San Francisco and Los Angeles, California, known for her portrayal of horses." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ruby_Neri> .

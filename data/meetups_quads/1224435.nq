He had a second career as a Senior PGA Tour professional golfer, and was a television broadcaster for both sports. During various years of his NFL career, Brodie led the League in passing yardage, passing touchdowns, fewest sacks, and lowest percentage of passes intercepted. He retired as the third most prolific career passer in NFL history, and was the league MVP in 1970 and a two-time Pro Bowler." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Brodie> .

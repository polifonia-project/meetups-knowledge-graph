<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Sutter> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Augustus Sutter (February 23, 1803 â€“ June 18, 1880), born Johann August Sutter and known in Spanish as Don Juan Sutter, was a Swiss immigrant of Mexican and American citizenship, known for establishing Sutter's Fort in the area that would eventually become Sacramento, California, the state's capital. Although he became famous following the discovery of gold by his employee James W. Marshall and the mill-making team at Sutter's Mill, Sutter saw his own business ventures fail during the California Gold Rush. Those of his elder son, John Augustus Sutter Jr., were more successful." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Sutter> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Gould_Shaw> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Gould Shaw (October 10, 1837 â€“ July 18, 1863) was an American officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born into a prominent Boston abolitionist family, he accepted command of the first all-black regiment (the 54th Massachusetts) in the Northeast. Supporting the promised equal treatment for his troops, he encouraged the men to refuse their pay until it was equal to that of white troops' wage. He led his regiment at the Second Battle of Fort Wagner in July 1863. They attacked a beachhead near Charleston, South Carolina, and Shaw was shot and killed while leading his men to the parapet of the Confederate-held fort. Although the regiment was overwhelmed by firing from the defenses and driven back, suffering many casualties, Shaw's leadership and the regiment became legendary." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Gould_Shaw> .

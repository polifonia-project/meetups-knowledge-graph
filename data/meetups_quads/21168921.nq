<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawrence_Brownlee> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lawrence Brownlee (born November 24, 1972) is an American operatic tenor particularly associated with the bel canto repertoire. Describing his voice, Speight Jenkins, general director of the Seattle Opera, said: \"There are other singers that sing this repertory very well, but I don't think anyone else has quite as beautiful a sound and as rounded a tone,\" and praise his \"incredible top notes\", adding about his high F (F5) in \"Credeasi, misera\": \"With him it's not a scream, it's a beautiful sound.\" Mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato adds: \"He is always in service of the music. His natural instrument is just incredibly beautiful. The word 'honey' comes to mind. He also has technical prowess and agility.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawrence_Brownlee> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dani_Osvaldo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pablo Daniel \"Dani\" Osvaldo (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdaːni oˈzvaldo]; born 12 January 1986) is a former professional footballer who played as a forward. Born and raised in Argentina, Osvaldo represented the Italy national team internationally. Osvaldo began his career at Huracán in 2005 and the following year moved to Italy in a co-ownership deal between Serie B clubs Atalanta and Lecce, later playing in the top flight for Fiorentina and Bologna. After a loan to RCD Espanyol, he joined the Spanish club on a permanent basis before earning a return to Italy to Roma for an initial fee of €15 million in 2011. He spent two seasons at the club and was then signed by Southampton, where he spent most of his time out on loan, at Juventus, Internazionale and Boca Juniors, before joining Porto. He returned to Boca in January 2016, but was later sacked by the club in May. Osvaldo qualified to represent Italy through his ancestry, having played initially for the nation's under-21 team before making his senior debut in 2011. At times, Osvaldo has been disciplined for having participated in various ferocious incidents with opponents, teammates and managers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dani_Osvaldo> .

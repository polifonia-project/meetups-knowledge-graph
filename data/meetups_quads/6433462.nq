<http://dbpedia.org/resource/B_Angie_B> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Angela Roxanna Boyd (born March 9, 1968), known by the stage name B Angie B, is a rhythm and blues vocalist and dancer. Boyd was notable as a backing vocalist and protégé for MC Hammer, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1991, she recorded for Hammer's Bust It Records label. She also released a charting album and three singles of her own with the label. Subsequent albums were less successful commercially, but Boyd continued occasionally releasing music in the 2000s and 2010s. AllMusic credits Boyd with exploring neo soul musical aesthetics within urban contemporary music, and described her as a forerunner to other African American female soul singers such as Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu and Jill Scott." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/B_Angie_B> .

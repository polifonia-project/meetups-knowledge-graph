A Republican, Carlson's viewpoints are considered to be moderate. He first won election to the governors office in 1990. Carlson served as the governor from 1991 until 1999, winning reelection in 1994 Minnesota gubernatorial election. Born into poverty in New York City, he attended the Choate Rosemary Hall preparatory school on a scholarship. After graduating from Williams College, he went to graduate school at the University of Minnesota. In his first race for elected office, Carlson ran for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council in 1965 as a Republican. Winning the election, he served until 1967. With the Republicans in the majority, Carlson also served as city council majority leader. He ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1967 against incumbent Democratic mayor Arthur Naftalin. Carlson lost the close election. He went on to serve in the Minnesota House of Representatives from 1971 until 1979. Carlson then was the Minnesota State Auditor from 1979 until 1991. He launched a bid for the Republican nomination for governor of Minnesota in 1990. He lost the primary election to businessman Jon Grunseth. However, Grunseth became embroiled in a scandal weeks before the election causing Carlson to take his place on the ballot. He defeated incumbent governor Rudy Perpich. In 1994, he easily won reelection to a second term. Since his return to private life in 1999, he has been an active supporter of Democratic candidates but remains a Republican." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arne_Carlson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Balavoine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniel Xavier-Marie Balavoine (French pronunciation: ​[danjɛl ɡzavje maʁi balavwan]; 5 February 1952 – 14 January 1986) was a French singer and songwriter. He was hugely popular in the French-speaking world in the early 1980s; he inspired many singers of his generation such as Jean-Jacques Goldman, Michel Berger, who was his closest friend, as well as the Japanese pop-rock group Crystal King. Balavoine was a part of the original cast of the rock opera Starmania in 1978, which was written by Berger. Balavoine also took part in motorsports and French political life; he is known for a 1980 televised verbal confrontation with then-Socialist presidential candidate François Mitterrand. In the French music business, he earned his place with his powerful voice, wide range and recognisable lyrics, which were full of sadness and revolt. His songs dealt in themes of despair, pain and death, although hope was present as well." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Balavoine> .

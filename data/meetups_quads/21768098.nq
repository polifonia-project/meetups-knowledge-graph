<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Alder> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jonathan Alder (September 17, 1773 â€“ January 30, 1849) was an American pioneer, and the first white settler in Madison County, Ohio. As a young child living in Virginia, Alder was kidnapped by Shawnee Indians, and later adopted by a Mingo chief in the Ohio Country. He lived with the Native Americans for many years before returning to the white community. Alder settled near present-day Plain City, Ohio, where he became a farmer. He was reunited with his birth family, which moved to Ohio with him, and also had a short career as a military officer during the War of 1812. A middle school, high school, and school district in Plain City all bear his name." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Alder> .

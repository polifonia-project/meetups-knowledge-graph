<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darryl_Kile> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Darryl Andrew Kile (December 2, 1968 â€“ June 22, 2002) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher. He pitched from 1991 to 2002 for three Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, primarily for the Houston Astros. Kile was known for his sharp, big-breaking curveball. He died at the age of 33 of coronary artery disease in 2002 in Chicago, where he and the St. Louis Cardinals were staying for a weekend series against the Chicago Cubs. He was the first active major league player to die during the regular season since 1979, when the New York Yankees' Thurman Munson died in a plane crash." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darryl_Kile> .

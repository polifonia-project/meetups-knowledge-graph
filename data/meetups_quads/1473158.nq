<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Martin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hugh Martin (August 11, 1914 â€“ March 11, 2011) was an American musical theater and film composer, arranger, vocal coach, and playwright. He was best known for his score for the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis, in which Judy Garland sang three Martin songs, \"The Boy Next Door,\" \"The Trolley Song,\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\" The last of these has become a Christmas season standard in the United States and around the English-speaking world. Martin became a close friend of Garland and was her accompanist at many of her concert performances in the 1950s, including her appearances at the Palace Theater." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Martin> .

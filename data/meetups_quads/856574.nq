<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joan_Vollmer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joan Vollmer (February 4, 1923 â€“ September 6, 1951) was an influential participant in the early Beat Generation circle. While a student at Barnard College, she became the roommate of Edie Parker (later married to Jack Kerouac). Their apartment became a gathering place for the Beats during the 1940s, where Vollmer was often at the center of marathon, all-night discussions. In 1946, she began a relationship with William S. Burroughs, later becoming his common-law wife. In 1951, Burroughs killed Vollmer. He claimed, and shortly thereafter denied, the killing was a drunken attempt at playing William Tell." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joan_Vollmer> .

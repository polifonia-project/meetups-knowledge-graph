Known as one of the first martial arts tricksters in open martial art competitions and early pioneers of non-traditional forms (NASKA), Ho helped to popularize the 540 kick and the Hawkeye Kick in the mid-eighties. Many consider Ho's influence, particularly his 540 kick, to be the beginning of the tricking movement. Ho is also well regarded for his stunt work as Donatello in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993) and his role as \"Chan\" in Mortal Kombat (1995). For the much anticipated Britney Spears music video, \"Hold It Against Me\", Ho trained Spears and fight choreographed the Britney vs. Britney fight for director Jonas Ã…kerlund. Ho was featured as himself on the ABC television reality series The Bachelor, where he directed a series of action scenes for Brad Womack and the contestants. The episode aired on 17 January 2011. He also featured himself on Bachelor Pad in season 3, as he taught and choreographed a fight scene for contestants Chris and Sarah. The episode aired on 13 August 2012. Ho co-founded Plush Home, Inc., an all-encompassing interior design firm and furniture line, in 2003 with his wife, Nina Petronzio, an American interior and furniture designer known for her high-end Transitional Style designs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Ho_(martial_artist)> .

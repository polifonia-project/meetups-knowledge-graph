<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trauma_I> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Trauma I (born March 27, 1985) is a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler, working on the Mexican independent circuit and as a freelance wrestler for promotions such as International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG), portraying a tecnico (\"Good guy\") wrestling character. Trauma I's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. Trauma I is a second-generation wrestler, the son of Miguel Calder√≥n Navarro, better known under his ring name Negro Navarro. He is the younger brother of Trauma II, who he regularly teams up with under the name Los Traumas. Trauma I is a freelance wrestler and thus is not exclusively working for one specific professional wrestling promotion but has worked for many Mexican wrestling promotions including working matches on shows promoted by the largest Mexican based promotions such as Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), and International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trauma_I> .

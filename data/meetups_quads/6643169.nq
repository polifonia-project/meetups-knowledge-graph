He has played in the Football League for Barnsley, Grimsby Town and York City and in the Scottish Premiership for St Johnstone. Coulson started his career with hometown club Scarborough, making his first-team debut in a Conference National match in 2004. His first goal for Scarborough, scored later that year, made him the youngest goalscorer in the club's history. He signed for Championship club Barnsley in 2006, before making a return to Conference Premier football with a loan at Northwich Victoria in 2007. Coulson suffered two cruciate ligament injuries in the space of a year before being loaned to Chester City of the Conference Premier in 2009. Coulson joined League Two club Grimsby Town on loan later that year, signing for the club permanently in 2010 after their relegation to the Conference Premier. He left Grimsby in 2012, signing for League Two club York City. In 2016, after four years with York, Coulson signed for Scottish Premiership club St Johnstone." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Coulson_(footballer)> .

She is a University Professor at Columbia University and a founding member of the establishment's Institute for Comparative Literature and Society. Considered one of the most influential postcolonial intellectuals, Spivak is best known for her essay \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" and her translation of and introduction to Jacques Derrida's De la grammatologie. She has also translated many works of Mahasweta Devi into English, with separate critical notes on Devi's life and writing style, notably Imaginary Maps and Breast Stories. Spivak was awarded the 2012 Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for being \"a critical theorist and educator speaking for the humanities against intellectual colonialism in relation to the globalized world.\" In 2013, she received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award given by the Republic of India. Although associated with postcolonialism, Spivak confirmed her separation from the discipline in her book \" (1999), a position she maintains in a 2021 essay titled \"How the Heritage of Postcolonial Studies Thinks Colonialism Today\", published by Janus Unbound: Journal of Critical Studies." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gayatri_Chakravorty_Spivak> .

His Tuscan roots have guided him through a career that celebrates simplicity and quality of ingredients. He was the man behind celebrated New York restaurants such as Beppe and Maremma in the 2000s. These days, Chef Casella acts as Chief of the Department of Nourishment Arts at the Center for Discovery nestled in the Catskills, and as Dean of Italian Studies at the International Culinary Center. He operates his own salumi company, Casella's Salumi, where he makes prosciutto from heritage breed pigs, true to the classic Italian recipes and flavors of his childhood in Tuscany. He has written several books including True Tuscan and The Fundamental Techniques of Italian Cooking, and most recently, Feeding the Heart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cesare_Casella> .

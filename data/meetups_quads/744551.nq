<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Drew_Jr.> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Drew Jr. (November 13, 1853 â€“ July 9, 1927), commonly known as John Drew during his life, was an American stage actor noted for his roles in Shakespearean comedy, society drama, and light comedies. He was the eldest son of John Drew Sr., who had given up a blossoming career in whaling for acting, and Louisa Lane Drew, and the brother of Louisa Drew, Georgiana Drew, and Sidney Drew. As such, he was also the uncle of John, Ethel, and Lionel Barrymore, and also great-great-uncle to Drew Barrymore. He was considered to be the leading matinee idol of his day, but unlike most matinee idols Drew's acting ability was largely undisputed." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Drew_Jr.> .

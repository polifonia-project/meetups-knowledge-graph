He is best known for making parody videos of notable songs, for which Billboard dubbed him one of the most prolific makers of music parodies. Baker is prominent on YouTube, where at one point his self-titled channel peaked at 10 million subscribers. Baker is also a top-earning broadcaster on the platforms Vine and Live.ly. His subsequent ventures include appearing in the 2016 film Laid in America, and uploading content onto the social media app Kwai and Douyin, where his English covers of Chinese songs have gained a following. In 2018, Baker was signed to World Star Hip Hop, with whom he released his debut single \"Popper\" under the stage name of Lil Kloroxxx." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bart_Baker> .

(\"Black Pearl\") in the late 1960s and 1970s. Wine also sang the female vocals for the cartoon music group The Archies, most notably on their #1 hit song \"Sugar, Sugar\" (singing the line \"I'm gonna make your life so sweet\"). She shared the lead vocals in the Archies' subsequent single, \"Jingle Jangle\" with Ron Dante using his falsetto voice. In addition, Wine was a backing vocalist on \"It Hurts to Be in Love\" (originally recorded for Neil Sedaka, whose vocals were replaced by those of Gene Pitney after Sedaka moved to RCA) and on Willie Nelson's \"Always on My Mind.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toni_Wine> .

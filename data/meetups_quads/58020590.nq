He was briefly a member of rock 'n' rollers the Delltones (1965–66) on vocals, pop group the Executives (1968–69) on guitar and vocals, progressive rockers Leo de Castro and Friends (1973) on guitar, and jazz fusion band Ayers Rock (1973–74) on guitar and vocals. In 1971 Burton was working in the United States where he co-wrote \"I Am Woman\" with fellow Australian, Helen Reddy, which became a number-one hit for her on the Billboard Hot 100 late in the following year. Another song written by the pair, \"Best Friend\", was sung by Reddy while she was also acting in a disaster film, Airport 1975 (October 1974). As a solo artist, Burton issued an album, Dreamers and Nightflyers and two associated singles, \"Too Hard to Handle\" and \"Paddington Green\", in 1978 in Australia. He returned to the US where he worked as a song writer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ray_Burton_(musician)> .

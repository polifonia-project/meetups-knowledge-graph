Most of his well-known work was in collaboration with Dee Dee Wood to whom he was married for many years.

In 1948 he appeared on Broadway in the original cast of Kiss Me, Kate at the New Century Theatre in New York City and in 1958 he appeared in Li'l Abner at the St. James Theatre, also in New York City.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baba_Tahir> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Baba Tahir or Baba Taher Oryan Hamadani (Persian: باباطاهر عریان همدانی) was an 11th-century Persian dervish poet from Hamadan, Iran who lived during the reign of Tugril of the Seljuk dynasty over Iran. This is almost all that is known of him as he lived a mysterious lifestyle. Although prefix \"Baba\" (roughly meaning 'The Wise' or 'The Respected') has been thought as part of his name in all known sources, his nickname \"Oryan\" ( meaning 'The Naked' ) did not appear until about 17th-century. The nickname was probably attributed to him because he seemed to lead a very spiritual and stoic lifestyle and thus was figuratively not clothed with worldly and material needs. His poetry is written in the Hamadani dialect of the Persian language. According to L. P. Elwell-Sutton he probably wrote in the Hamadani dialect, adding: \"Most traditional sources call it loosely Luri, while the name commonly applied from an early date to verses of this kind, Fahlaviyat, presumably implies that they were thought to be in a language related to the Middle Persian language. Rouben Abrahamian however found a close affinity with the dialect spoken at the present time by the Jews of Hamadan.\" According to The Cambridge History of Iran, Baba Tahir spoke a certain Persian dialect." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baba_Tahir> .

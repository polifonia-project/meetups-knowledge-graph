<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amy_Elsie_Horrocks> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Amy Elsie Horrocks (23 February 1867 – 1919) was an English music educator, composer and pianist. She was born to English parents (Francis James Horrocks 8 July 1829 – 27 April 1913) and Hannah Horrocks (née Allen 1833 – 22 April 1913) in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and in 1882 studied piano and composition at the Royal Academy of Music with Adolf Schlösser and Francis William Davenport. She won the Potter Exhibition prize in 1888 and the Bennett Prize in 1889. After completing her studies, she performed as a pianist and taught music in London. There are claims that she was proposed to by Sir Henry Wood, whom she turned down. One of her compositions, Romaunt of the Page, had its premiere at one of the Promenade Concerts on 6 October 1899. She eventually married Nicholas Paramythioti (1871–1943) a businessman from Corfu, on 22 August 1903, one of many lodgers at the house in Hampstead (17 Goldhurst Terrace) that the family used to let rooms to. Around this time she and Nicholas moved to France (where her two children were born, John in 1904 and Pamela in 1906) and she divided her time between France and Margate (where her parents had retired to and where they are both buried, having succumbed to the influenza epidemic, dying within a few days of each other in 1913). She kept a diary, (which spans the years 1907 to 1918) which she wrote as a sort of ‘life-guidance manual’ for her two children. These few entries give an insight into her opinions about music and composition." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amy_Elsie_Horrocks> .

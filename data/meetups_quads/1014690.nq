<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Namlook> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pete Namlook (born 25 November 1960 as Peter Kuhlmann [ˈkuːlmaːn] in Frankfurt, West Germany, died on 8 November 2012) was an ambient and electronic music producer and composer. In 1992, he founded the German record label FAX +49-69/450464, which he oversaw. He was inspired by the music of Eberhard Weber, Miles Davis, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Chopin, Wendy Carlos, Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd, and most importantly Klaus Schulze. Pete Namlook released many solo albums, as well as collaboration albums with notable artists such as Klaus Schulze, Bill Laswell, Geir Jenssen (Biosphere), Gaudi, Richie Hawtin, Tetsu Inoue, Uwe Schmidt (Atom™), (Dr. Atmo), and David Moufang (Move D). By August 2005, Namlook and collaborators had released 135 albums (excluding re-releases, vinyl singles, compilations of existing material, and FAX releases beginning with PS, in which he personally was not involved in the music making). \"Namlook\" is \"Koolman\", a phonetic rendering of his real name, spelled backwards. Kuhlmann died on 8 November 2012 after suffering a heart attack." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Namlook> .

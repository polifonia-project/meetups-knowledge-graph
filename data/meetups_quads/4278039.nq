<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_McComb> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Richard McComb (17 February 1962 – 2 February 1999) was an Australian musician. He was the singer-songwriter and guitarist of the Australian bands, The Triffids (1976–89) and The Blackeyed Susans (1989–93). He also had a solo career including leading David McComb and The Red Ponies. Over his career McComb had bouts of alcoholism, and amphetamine and heroin abuse. He developed cardiomyopathy and in 1996 underwent a heart transplant. David McComb died on 2 February 1999 \"due to heroin toxicity and mild acute rejection of his 1996 heart transplant\", according to the coroner. In May 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named \"Wide Open Road\" by The Triffids – written by McComb – as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. On 1 July 2008 The Triffids were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame with McComb's contribution acknowledged by a tribute performance." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_McComb> .

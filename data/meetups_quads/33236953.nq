<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Morgan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Morgan Edwards (December 4, 1932 â€“ June 23, 2022), better known as Tommy Morgan, was an American harmonicist and session musician, who had been active since the 1950s. He was considered one of the most heard harmonica players in the world, playing in over 500 feature films. Morgan's extraordinarily prolific career spanned seven decades, and included playing on (and occasionally composing) themes and incidental music for hundreds of episodes of American television series, and dozens of major Hollywood films. Although frequently uncredited in his earlier career (as was typical for session musicians of that era), Morgan also has a huge list of credits in popular music -- among the most notable in that field are his prominent contributions to the seminal mid-1960s recordings by The Beach Boys, including the Pet Sounds album, their number one single \"Good Vibrations\" and the recordings made for their uncompleted Smile project. He retired after a stroke in late 2013 and died at the age of 89 on June 23, 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Morgan> .

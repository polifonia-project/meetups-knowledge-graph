He was best known as one of the stars of the MTV reality stunt show Jackass and its film franchise. Born in Medina, Ohio, Dunn rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of the CKY crew with his long-time friend Bam Margera, with whom he performed extreme stunts and pranks and recorded them on video, which led to the rise of Jackass. He also hosted the TV series Homewrecker and Proving Ground, and he appeared in the feature films Blonde Ambition and Street Dreams as well as in Margera's films Haggard and Minghags. Dunn died in a car crash in 2011 at the age of 34." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ryan_Dunn> .

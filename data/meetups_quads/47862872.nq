He was best known as one of the members of the Memphis rap group Three 6 Mafia, as well as a member of the rap collective Da Mafia 6ix alongside DJ Paul, Crunchy Black and Gangsta Boo. Phillips released a solo album produced by DJ Paul, Da Devil's Playground in 1994. The album was later mostly re-recorded as well as remastered in 1999 featuring an alternate tracklist. Unable to make shows and videos due to legal issues, he left Three 6 Mafia in 2000. He continued his solo work with albums Da K Project, De Inevitable, and The Mind of Robert Cooper. Beginning in 2012, Phillips started work on his latest studio album entitled Da Devil's Playground 2 and also a mixtape entitled Skrewged. He had also released A Murda 'N Room 8 EP (2010) and Decepticons – Return Of The Gods (2012).

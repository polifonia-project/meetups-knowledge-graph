<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Palmer_(folklorist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roy Ernest Palmer (10 February 1932 â€“ 26 February 2015) was a singer, teacher, folklorist, author and historian who wrote more than 30 books on folklore and folk song. In 2003 he was awarded the Gold Badge, the English Folk Dance and Song Society's highest honour. He had much experience of performing to an audience, setting him apart from better known folk song scholars and anthologists who collected material but were less concerned with singing it." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Palmer_(folklorist)> .

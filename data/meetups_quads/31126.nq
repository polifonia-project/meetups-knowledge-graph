<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Gainsborough> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Gainsborough RA FRSA (14 May 1727 (baptised) â€“ 2 August 1788) was an English portrait and landscape painter, draughtsman, and printmaker. Along with his rival Sir Joshua Reynolds, he is considered one of the most important British artists of the second half of the 18th century. He painted quickly, and the works of his maturity are characterised by a light palette and easy strokes. Despite being a prolific portrait painter, Gainsborough gained greater satisfaction from his landscapes. He is credited (with Richard Wilson) as the originator of the 18th-century British landscape school. Gainsborough was a founding member of the Royal Academy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Gainsborough> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Trinder> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Thomas Edward Trinder CBE (24 March 1909 â€“ 10 July 1989) was an English stage, screen and radio comedian whose catchphrase was \"You lucky people!\". Described by cultural historian Matthew Sweet as \"a cocky, front-of-cloth variety turn\", he was one of the United Kingdom's foremost entertainers during the Second World War. Known for his confident and direct style of comedy, Trinder first found recognition with his music hall revues in the late 1930s. During the war, he worked for ENSA and maintained a successful film career, starring in a string of Ealing Studios films including Sailors Three (1940), Champagne Charlie (1944) and Bitter Springs (1950). During the 1950s, Trinder became a television star, notably as the original host for Sunday Night at the London Palladium (1955-1958). In 1959, he was elected chairman of Fulham Football Club, a position he maintained until 1976. He continued to perform into the 1980s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Trinder> .

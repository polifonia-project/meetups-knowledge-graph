Turle was born at Taunton, Somerset, and started as a choirboy at Wells Cathedral. In 1817 he became a pupil of G. E. Williams, organist at Westminster Abbey in London, and after acting as deputy for some years he succeeded to this post himself in 1831 and held it until his death. He and Sir John Goss, the organist at St Paul's Cathedral, had been fellow pupils in London as boys. Turle was a great organist in his day, and composed a good deal of church music which was well known. His son Henry Frederic Turle (1835–1883) was a journalist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Turle> .

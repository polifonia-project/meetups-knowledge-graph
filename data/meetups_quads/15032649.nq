<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_James_Hutchison,_1st_Baronet> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir James Riley Holt Hutchison, 1st Baronet, DSO, TD, JP (10 April 1893 â€“ 24 February 1979) was a British army officer, company director and politician. He was the son of a Scottish shipowner and spent his commercial life in the same field and as a director of shipbuilders, but fought in both World Wars during a long military career. He distinguished himself as the principal British liaison officer with the French Resistance during the Second World War in which he needed plastic surgery to disguise his appearance from the Germans; he was nicknamed the \"Pimpernel of the Maquis\". At the end of the Second World War he was elected as a Unionist Member of Parliament in Glasgow, and although the city was turning against his party he enjoyed a 14-year Parliamentary career." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_James_Hutchison,_1st_Baronet> .

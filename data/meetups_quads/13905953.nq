<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clifford_Grey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clifford Grey (5 January 1887 â€“ 25 September 1941) was an English songwriter, librettist, actor and screenwriter. His birth name was Percival Davis, and he was also known as Clifford Gray. Grey contributed prolifically to West End and Broadway shows, as librettist and lyricist for composers including Ivor Novello, Jerome Kern, Howard Talbot, Ivan Caryll and George Gershwin. Among his best-remembered songs are two from early in his career, in 1916: \"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\" and \"Another Little Drink Wouldn't Do Us Any Harm\". His later hits include \"Got a Date with an Angel\" and \"Spread a Little Happiness\". For 35 years after 1979 it was widely believed that Grey secretly competed as an American bobsleigher, under the name Clifford \"Tippy\" Gray, in two Winter Olympics, in 1928 and 1932, winning gold medals, but it was finally shown that the sportsman was a different person." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clifford_Grey> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcial_Maciel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Marcial Maciel Degollado LC (March 10, 1920 – January 30, 2008) was a Mexican Catholic priest who founded the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi movement. He was general director of the Legion from 1941 to 2005. Throughout most of his career, he was respected within the Church as \"the greatest fundraiser of the modern Roman Catholic church\" and as a prolific recruiter of new seminarians. Late in his life, Maciel was revealed to have been a long time drug addict who sexually abused many boys and young men in his care. After his death, it came to light that he had also maintained sexual relationships with at least four women, one of whom was a minor at the time. He fathered as many as six children, two of whom he is alleged to have sexually abused. In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI removed Maciel from active ministry, based on the results of an investigation that he had started in his previous role as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith before his election as Pope in April 2005. Maciel was ordered \"to conduct a reserved life of prayer and penance, renouncing every public ministry\". He died in 2008. On March 25, 2010, a communiqué on the Legion's website acknowledged as factual the \"reprehensible actions\" by Maciel, including sexual abuse of minor seminarians. In May 2010, the Vatican denounced Maciel's actions and appointed a Papal Delegate to oversee the order and its governance." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcial_Maciel> .

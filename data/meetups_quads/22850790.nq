Mishra plays with an eclecticism well suited to his multicultural background combining both Eastern and Western influences. He has been quoted saying, \"I come from a tradition that has a lot of improvisation. Sometimes Western classical music can seem a little rigid, I had to find some middle ground.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanjay_Mishra_(musician)> .

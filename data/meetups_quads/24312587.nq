<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Bowermaster> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jon Bowermaster (born June 29, 1954) is an oceans expert, journalist, author, filmmaker, adventurer and six-time grantee of the National Geographic Expeditions Council. One of the Society’s ‘Ocean Heroes,’ his first assignment for National Geographic Magazine was documenting a 3,741 mile crossing of Antarctica by dogsled. Jon has written eleven books and produced/directed more than thirty documentary films. His feature documentaries include ‘Dear President Obama,’ ‘Antarctica, on the Edge,’ ‘After the Spill’ and ‘Ghost Fleet.’ He is a longtime contributor to magazines ranging from The New York Times Magazine and The Atlantic to Outside and Rolling Stone. His National Geographic-sponsored Oceans 8 project took him and his teams around the world by sea kayak over the course of ten years (1999-2008), bringing back stories from the Aleutian Islands to French Polynesia, Gabon to Tasmania, and more, reporting on how the planet’s one ocean, its residents and various coastlines are faring in today’s busy world. The project resulted in an eight-part television series for the National Geographic Channel. For the past several years, Jon and his One Ocean Media Foundation / Oceans 8 Films team have focused on Hudson River Stories, a series of short films about the environmental risks to and hopes for the Hudson River Valley, the birthplace of the American environmental movement. Jon is a Visiting Lecturer at Bard College, in the Environment and Urban Studies Department. He hosts weekly radio show/podcast, ‘The Green Radio Hour with Jon Bowermaster' on Radio Kingston. Jon lives in New York’s Hudson Valley and is the President of the One Ocean Media Foundation and Chairman of the Advisory Board of Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Bowermaster> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brad_Johnson_(American_football)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Bradley Johnson (born September 13, 1968) is a former American football quarterback. During his 17-year career in the National Football League (NFL), Johnson played for the Minnesota Vikings, Washington Redskins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Dallas Cowboys. He is best known for his time with the Buccaneers, whom he led to their Super Bowl XXXVII title over the Oakland Raiders. Johnson is also notable for being the first player in the NFL to complete a touchdown pass to himself, doing so in a 1997 game against the Carolina Panthers. He remained the only player to do so until Marcus Mariota repeated the feat in a 2018 postseason game." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brad_Johnson_(American_football)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamza_Hakimzade_Niyazi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hamza Hakimzade Niyazi (Uzbek: Hamza Hakimzoda Niyoziy / Ҳамза Ҳакимзода Ниёзий) (March 6 [O.S. February 22] 1889, Kokand – March 18, 1929, Shohimardon) was an Uzbek author, composer, playwright, poet, scholar, and political activist. Niyazi, along with Gʻafur Gʻulom, is widely seen as one of the leading figures in the early development of modern Uzbek literary tradition. He is generally considered the first Uzbek playwright, the founder of modern Uzbek musical forms, as well as the founder of Uzbek social realism. Niyazi also participated in the controversial Uzbek language reforms of the 1920s which were meant to codify a literary Uzbek language in place of the older, fading Chagatai. In addition to Uzbek, Niyazi knew many other languages, including Arabic, Persian, Russian, and Turkish. His works generally dealt with social issues, such as women's rights, social inequality, and the prevalence of superstition. Niyazi was stoned to death in the town of Shohimardon, by Islamic fundamentalists on the accusation of anti-religious activities. Niyazi became a National Writer of the Uzbek SSR in 1926. To honor his memory, in 1967 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan established the State Hamza Prize to recognize outstanding achievement in literature, arts, and architecture. Many institutions in Uzbekistan, including a station of Tashkent Metro, three theaters, as well as several schools and streets are named after him." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamza_Hakimzade_Niyazi> .

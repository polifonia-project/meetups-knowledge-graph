<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_Whitlock> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Simon Whitlock (born 3 March 1969) is an Australian professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments, having also played in the British Darts Organisation (BDO) between 2004 and 2009. He uses the nickname The Wizard for his matches. His walk-on music is \"Down Under\" by Men at Work. His greatest achievements to date are winning the 2012 European Championship and 2022 World Cup of Darts for Australia with Damon Heta.Whitlock has also finished runner-up at the 2008 BDO World Darts Championship and the 2010 PDC World Darts Championship. He claimed that the prize money gained from the latter tournament which included money for the highest checkout (joint with Phil Taylor) would allow him to move over to the UK from Australia and compete on the PDC Pro Tour. His defeat also made him the first, and as of 2022 only, player to have never won a World Championship after reaching both the BDO and PDC World Championship Final." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_Whitlock> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/S._R._Nathan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sellapan Ramanathan DUT PJG ( /ˈsɛləpən rɑːməˈnɑːðən/; 3 July 1924 – 22 August 2016), often known as S. R. Nathan, was a Singaporean politician who served as the sixth president of Singapore between 1999 and 2011. He was also the longest-serving president in Singapore's history. Nathan contested in the 1999 presidential election and won by an uncontested walkover. He was re-elected as president after winning the 2005 presidential election uncontested again. In 2009, Nathan surpassed Benjamin Sheares to become Singapore's longest-serving president. Nathan was reportedly considering for a re-election, but announced on 2 July 2011, that he would not seek for a third term in office. Nathan suffered a stroke on 31 July 2016 and was taken to Singapore General Hospital before he died in the hospital on 22 August 2016, at the age of 92." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/S._R._Nathan> .

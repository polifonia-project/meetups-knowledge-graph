<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valerie_Agnew> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Valerie Agnew is best known as the drummer of 7 Year Bitch. Agnew moved from Ohio to Seattle, Washington, where she met the musicians that would become her future bandmates: Selene Vigil (vocals), Elizabeth Davis (bass), and Stefanie Sargent (lead guitar). They formed 7 Year Bitch and signed with C/Z Records. They released their debut album Sick 'Em in 1992. While still living in Ohio, Agnew dated Steve Moriarty, the drummer for the American punk band the Gits. Additionally, Agnew was a very close friend of Mia Zapata, the band's frontwoman. In 1993, Zapata was brutally raped and murdered while walking home late at night. In response, Agnew and 7 Year Bitch released the album Â¡Viva Zapata!, dedicated to Zapata. The album also featured songs about former guitarist Stefanie Sargent, who died due to a drug overdose on June 27, 1992. In 1995, the band signed with Atlantic Records, and a year later released their final studio album, Gato Negro. With the recent departure of their guitarist, Roisin Dunne, and the geographical separation between bandmates, 7 Year Bitch's career came to a close after a final tour with San Francisco's Lost Goat." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valerie_Agnew> .

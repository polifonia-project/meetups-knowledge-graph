<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Craig> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniel Wroughton Craig CMG (born 2 March 1968) is an English-American actor who gained international fame playing the secret agent James Bond in the film series, beginning with Casino Royale (2006) and in four further instalments, up to No Time to Die (2021). After training at the National Youth Theatre in London and graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1991, Craig began his career on stage. He made his film debut in the drama The Power of One (1992) and the family film A Kid in King Arthur's Court (1995), with his breakthrough role coming in the drama serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He gained prominence for his supporting roles in films such as Elizabeth (1998), Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), Road to Perdition (2002), Layer Cake (2004), and Munich (2005). In 2006, he played James Bond in Casino Royale, a reboot of the Bond franchise which was favourably received by critics and earned Craig a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His non-Bond appearances since then include roles in the fantasy film The Golden Compass (2007), the drama Defiance (2008), the science fiction Western Cowboys & Aliens (2011), the mystery thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), the heist film Logan Lucky (2017), and the mystery comedy Knives Out (2019), the last earning him a Golden Globe Award nomination. In 2011, he made his Broadway debut in the revival of Harold Pinter's Betrayal opposite his wife, the actress Rachel Weisz. In 2016, he starred in the New York Theatre Workshop production of Othello. In 2022, he returned to Broadway in the title role of Macbeth with Ruth Negga." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Craig> .

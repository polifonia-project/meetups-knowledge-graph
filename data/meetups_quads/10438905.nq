<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Young_Chris> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Christopher Francis Ries (born March 9, 1983), known professionally as Young Chris, is an American rapper. He is a member of Philadelphia rap duo Young Gunz alongside his childhood friend, rapper Neef Buck, signed to Roc-A-Fella Records. The duo saw their greatest success with their 2003 debut single \"Can't Stop, Won't Stop\". The duo released two albums: Tough Luv (2004) and Brothers from Another (2005) and were apart of Beanie Sigel's State Property collective. Young Chris was signed in December 2010 as a solo artist to Universal Motown through producer/songwriter Rico Love's label imprint Division1. He released two albums through Division1: LIFE: Ladies In For Free and The Revival, both in 2011. In 2014 he released the album Gunna Season through Jaccpot Entertainment. He has also had a large number of self-released mixtapes from 2007 to the present. Young Chris is often confused with the rapper YC, who used to perform as \"Yung Chris\", and is thus sometimes incorrectly credited as the performer of the YC song \"Racks\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Young_Chris> .

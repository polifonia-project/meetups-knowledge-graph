<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Halloway> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Arthur 'Pony' Halloway (1885–1961), was a pioneering Australian rugby league footballer and coach. Born in Sydney, New South Wales he played for the Glebe Dirty Reds (1908), Balmain Tigers (1909–1911 and 1915–1920) and Eastern Suburbs (1912–1914), in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. He played for New South Wales in the first rugby match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union. He was a half-back for the Australian national team. He played in ten Tests between 1908 and 1919, as captain on three occasions in 1919. Halloway was nicknamed 'Pony', but despite his small stature he was recognised as one of the fiercest competitors to play the game and one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century Halloway holds the record for the most premierships won as a coach in Australian rugby league history with eight premierships. Halloway also holds the record for the longest undefeated streak as a coach in Australian rugby league history with 35 games undefeated." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Halloway> .

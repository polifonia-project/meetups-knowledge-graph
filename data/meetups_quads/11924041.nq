<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder_of_Jessie_Davis> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jessie Marie Davis (May 27, 1981 â€“ June 14, 2007) was a murdered, near-term pregnant, 26-year-old American woman first reported missing from her home in Lake Township, Stark County, Ohio on June 15, 2007. The case drew an extraordinary response from the American media. On February 15, 2008, Bobby Lee Cutts Jr., a police officer and the father of her 2-year-old son and unborn daughter, was convicted of the aggravated murders of Davis and their unborn child. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole for 57 years on February 27, 2008. A high-school friend of Cutts, Myisha Lynne Ferrell, was also later charged." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder_of_Jessie_Davis> .

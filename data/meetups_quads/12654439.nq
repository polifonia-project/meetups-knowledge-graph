<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loren_Miller_(judge)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Loren Miller (January 20, 1903 â€“ July 14, 1967) was an American journalist, civil rights activist, attorney, and judge. Miller was appointed to the Los Angeles County Superior Court by governor Edmund G. \"Pat\" Brown in 1964 and served until his death in 1967. Miller was a specialist in housing discrimination, whose involvement in the early stages of the Civil Rights Movement earned him a reputation as a tenacious fighter for equal housing opportunities for minorities. Miller argued some of the most historic civil rights cases ever heard before the Supreme Court of the United States. He was chief counsel before the court in the 1948 decision that led to the outlawing of racial restrictive covenants, Shelley v. Kraemer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loren_Miller_(judge)> .

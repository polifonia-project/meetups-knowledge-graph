Born in England, he is the son of former Scotland international defender Colin Hendry, and began his career with his father's former club Blackburn Rovers, during which time he spent time on loan at non-league Clitheroe. After being released by Blackburn in 2017 without making an appearance, Hendry then moved to Scotland, signing for St Johnstone, and spent time on loan at Brechin City, Aberdeen, and Kilmarnock. After five years with Saints, he returned to England to sign for Salford." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Callum_Hendry> .

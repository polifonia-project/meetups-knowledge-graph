<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Wheeler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hugh Callingham Wheeler (19 March 1912 â€“ 26 July 1987) was a British novelist, screenwriter, librettist, poet and translator. He resided in the United States from 1934 until his death and became a naturalized citizen in 1942. He had attended London University. Under the noms de plume Patrick Quentin, Q. Patrick and Jonathan Stagge, Wheeler was the author or co-author of many mystery novels and short stories. In 1963, his 1961 collection, The Ordeal of Mrs. Snow was given a Special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. He won the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical in 1973 and 1974 for his books for the musicals A Little Night Music and Candide, and won both again in 1979 for his book for Sweeney Todd. Wheeler is credited as \"research consultant\" for the film Cabaret, though numerous sources list him as co-writer of the screenplay." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Wheeler> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monica_Beverly_Hillz> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Monica Dejesus-Anaya, known by the stage persona Monica Beverly Hillz, is an American reality television personality and transgender activist, originally known for appearing on season 5 of RuPaul's Drag Race. She was the second contestant in the show's history to come out as a transgender woman on the show, after Sonique in season 2 (who came out during the show's reunion special). Hillz coming out was historic as it was a first for network television. In 2014, she was selected as one of the Windy City Times \"30 Under 30\" for the \"best LGBTQIA activism, business, culture, non-profit work and more\" as well as Bustle naming her one of the \"most popular\" RPDR alum. In 2015, she performed at the MTV Video Music Awards with Miley Cyrus for her live performance of \"Dooo It!\", along with other well known drag queens and RPDR alum." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monica_Beverly_Hillz> .

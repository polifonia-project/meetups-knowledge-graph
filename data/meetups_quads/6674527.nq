The U.S. government considers him a domestic terrorist, having been arrested and charged in federal court on multiple counts of arson and conspiracy, relating to the arson of Superior Lumber company in Glendale, Oregon, on January 2, 2001, and Jefferson Poplar Farms in Clatskanie, Oregon, on May 21, 2001. His arrest is part of what the FBI dubbed Operation Backfire. McGowan was facing a minimum of life in prison if convicted when he accepted a non-cooperation plea agreement, pleading guilty on November 9, 2006. A \"terrorism\" label was applied to his sentence, and McGowan was ultimately sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment. He was released on probation in June 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_G._McGowan> .

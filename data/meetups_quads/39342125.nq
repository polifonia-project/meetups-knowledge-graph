<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indrani_Mukherjee> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Indrani Mukherjee (born 1 March 1942) is an Indian actress who worked in Hindi films during the 1960s and 1970s and starred in over 70 films. After playing the heroine in some films, notably Usne Kaha Tha (1960) and Aakhri Khat (1966), she moved to playing character roles which were central to the film and made this her forte. Her roles in films like Dharam Veer (1977), Parvarish (1977) and Des Pardes (1978) were the pivot of the storyline, but they were not conventional heroine roles. Each of the movies were a success at the box office." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indrani_Mukherjee> .

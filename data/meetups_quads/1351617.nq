<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_May_(cricketer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Barker Howard May CBE (31 December 1929 – 27 December 1994) was an English cricketer who played for Surrey County Cricket Club, Cambridge University and England. Already a cricketing prodigy during his school days, May played his entire cricket career as an amateur, and was regarded by many players and fans as England's finest batsman in the post-war era. Described in his Wisden obituary as \"tall and handsome with a batting style that was close to classical, and... the hero of a generation of school boys\", May was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1981, and posthumously inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009. Wisden Cricketer's Almanack described May as a \"schoolboy prodigy\" who went on to become \"one of England’s finest batsmen\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_May_(cricketer)> .

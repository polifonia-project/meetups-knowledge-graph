He is a core member of Black Dice and forms half of the duo Terrestrial Tones with Animal Collective's Avey Tare. Copeland uses a variety of instruments and effects but largely focuses his work on vocal sounds, primitive sampling and looping techniques, and delay manipulation. Copeland released his first solo effort, Hermaphrodite, in 2007 on the Paw Tracks label. His next LP, Alien in a Garbage Dump, released in August 2009, is composed of songs from his EPs Alien in a Garbage Dump and Al Anon. In 2009, Copeland self-released the CD-R Rgag EP. He was chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they curated in May 2011. In 2012, he teamed up with Underwater Peoples Records to release his album, Limbo. His latest album, Dumb It Down, was released in September 2020 on Post Present Media." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Copeland> .

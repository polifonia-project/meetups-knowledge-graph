<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brett_Cecil> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brett Aarion Cecil (born July 2, 1986) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and St. Louis Cardinals. Cecil was drafted as the 38th overall pick in the 2007 MLB draft by the Blue Jays. He pitched for DeMatha Catholic High School and the Maryland Terrapins of the University of Maryland, College Park. In the summer of 2005, he pitched for the Silver Spring-Takoma Thunderbolts in the Cal Ripken Collegiate Baseball League and threw the first and only no-hitter by a single pitcher in league history. He first pitched in a professional league for the Class A Auburn Doubledays in 2007. In 2008, he was promoted to the Dunedin Blue Jays, and later to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, and finally to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs. He received an invitation to attend spring training with the Blue Jays in 2009, but began the season in Triple-A. Although he pitches left-handed, he is usually right-handed; pitching is \"the only thing he does left-handed\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brett_Cecil> .

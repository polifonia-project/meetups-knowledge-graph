<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Butin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roy Hunter Butin (October 30, 1876, Logan, Ohio â€“ August 16, 1943, Long Beach, California) was an American recording artist in the early 20th century, known for his playing of the harp guitar. He recorded more than a dozen early cylinder and 78 rpm records. From at least 1906 to 1916, he performed as one half of The Olivotti Troubadours with Michael Banner. Artists he recorded with also included Samuel Siegel, Valentine Abt, and W. Eugene Page. Contrary to popular belief, he was not part of the Ossman-Dudley Trio, which featured Vess Ossman on banjo, Audley Dudley on mandolin and George Dudley on harp guitar. Roy was married twice. His first marriage to Florence McPhail, in April 1898, ended in divorce before 1900. His second marriage was to an actress, Elsie Clare Sanford, in September 1912. That marriage ended in divorce in July 1925. His last relationship was with his housekeeper, Emma Oldham. No marriage is recorded, but it appears they did live together." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Butin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicole_Brown_Simpson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nicole Brown Simpson (née Brown; May 19, 1959 – June 12, 1994) was the ex-wife of the former professional American football player, O. J. Simpson, to whom she was married from 1985 to 1992. She was the mother of their two children, Sydney and Justin. Two years after her divorce from Simpson, Brown was stabbed to death at her Los Angeles home, on June 12, 1994, along with her friend, waiter Ron Goldman. O. J. Simpson, who had a history of physically abusing and making death threats toward Brown, was arrested and accused of both killings. Following a controversial and highly publicized criminal trial, which included evidence linking Simpson to the murders, Simpson was acquitted of all charges. He was later found liable for both deaths in a civil lawsuit in 1997." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicole_Brown_Simpson> .

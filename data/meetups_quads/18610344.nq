He is mainly known as a member of the Irish folk duo Tír na nÓg. After the band broke up, he produced albums on Polydor and EMI labels for other Irish artists like Restless Nights in 1975 by Ray Dolan who wrote \"Hey Friend\" on the first Tír na nÓg LP. In 2000, Leo released his first solo album called Glare, then Proto in 2003 which consists in a collection of songs that he recorded between 1975 and 2001 whose one is a cover with Mark Gilligan of Nick Drake's \"Northern Sky\" and another is a vocal improvisation by his son, Aaron O'Kelly, at the age of 1. His third album, Will, was released in February 2011 and features the poems of John McKenna set to music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_O'Kelly> .

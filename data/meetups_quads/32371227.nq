<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Harvey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Matthew Edward Harvey (born March 27, 1989), nicknamed The Dark Knight, is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Los Angeles Angels, Kansas City Royals, and Baltimore Orioles. Harvey played baseball and basketball at Fitch Senior High School in Groton, Connecticut, and continued his baseball career the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Mets selected Harvey in the 2010 MLB draft as the seventh overall pick. In his major league debut on July 26, 2012, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Harvey set a new club record with 11 strikeouts while earning his first career victory. Harvey had a breakout season in 2013, being selected to play in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Harvey then missed the entire 2014 season due to Tommy John surgery but returned in 2015 as his team won the pennant. His career, once promising during his first two seasons, has since been derailed by ineffectiveness after injuries, including Tommy John surgery, thoracic outlet syndrome, and a stress fracture in the scapula. After a disappointing start to the 2018 season, Harvey was traded to the Cincinnati Reds. He signed with the Los Angeles Angels in 2019, but was released midway through the season after posting a 3â€“5 record with a 7.09 earned run average. He signed with the Orioles for the 2021 season." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Harvey> .

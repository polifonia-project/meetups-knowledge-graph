<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeane_Manson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeane Manson (born Jean Ann Manson on October 1, 1950) is an American model, singer, and actor, born in Cleveland, Ohio. Her first name was changed from \"Jean\" to \"Jeane\" because, as all of her career was in France after 1974, the French would have otherwise thought that she was a man, \"Jean\" being the French for \"John\". After being photographed for Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month in August 1974, she moved to France and appeared in several films, including Bons Baisers de Hong Kong (1975). The following year, she became known for the song \"Avant de nous dire adieu\". In 1979 she represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"J'ai déjà vu ça dans tes yeux\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeane_Manson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Rado> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Rado FRS (28 April 1906 â€“ 23 December 1989) was a German-born British mathematician whose research concerned combinatorics and graph theory. He was Jewish and left Germany to escape Nazi persecution. He earned two PhDs: in 1933 from the University of Berlin, and in 1935 from the University of Cambridge. He was interviewed in Berlin by Lord Cherwell for a scholarship given by the chemist Sir Robert Mond which provided financial support to study at Cambridge. After he was awarded the scholarship, Rado and his wife left for the UK in 1933. He was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Reading in 1954 and remained there until he retired in 1971." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Rado> .

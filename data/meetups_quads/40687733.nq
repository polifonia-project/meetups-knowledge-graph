His father was Andreas Erhard von Gaudi, a Prussian colonel who died in action near Habelschwerdt on 14 February 1745. His mother was Maria Elisabeth von Grävenitz. Gaudi came from a noble, originally Scottish family, which had served the rulers of Brandenburg for more than 100 years. He studied in Königsberg, and then in 1744 entered the Infantry Regiment \"Prinz Heinrich\" (Nr. 35). He participated in the war in Bohemia, the siege of Prague, and the withdrawal to Silesia. Then he was detailed to recruitment activities. In 1750 he became a Second Lieutenant, and in 1755 a First Lieutenant. He was made a Captain in 1756, as well as aide-de-camp to Frederick the Great.

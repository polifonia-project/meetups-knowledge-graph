The artist's work spans a range of media, including drawing, sculpture, video, performance, and the internet. Originally working under the alias asianpunkboy, Koh designed zines and custom-made books. His recent work has expanded to include durational performances, complex installations, and the exploration of natural ecosystems. Much of his diverse work involves queer, punk, and pornographic sensibilities. In 2008, he was listed in Out magazine's \"Out 100 People of the Year\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Terence_Koh> .

Son of former president Luis Alberto Lacalle, Lacalle Pou attended The British Schools of Montevideo and graduated from Catholic University of Uruguay in 1998 with a law degree. A member of the National Party, he was first elected to the Chamber of Representatives at the 1999 election as a National Representative for the Canelones Department, a position he held from 2000 to 2015. During the first session of the 47th Legislature (2011–2012) he chaired the lower house of the General Assembly. He also served as Senator from 2015 to 2019. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2014. Five years later, he defeated the Broad Front nominee and former mayor of Montevideo Daniel Martínez in the 2019 general election and was elected President of Uruguay with 50.79% of the vote in the second round. At the age of 46, Lacalle Pou ended the 15-year leftist rule in the country and became the youngest president since the end of the dictatorship in 1985." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luis_Lacalle_Pou> .

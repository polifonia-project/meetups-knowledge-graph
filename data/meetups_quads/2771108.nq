He became notorious because of his socially conscious columns, as well as his equally controversial opinions during interviews. He published both in HUMO as well as Knack and founded his own short-lived satirical magazine, in 1982-1985. The main public got to know him thanks to his television appearances, both as panel member in the quiz De Wies Andersen Show and as interviewer in the talkshow Noord-Zuid (North-South).

Still, together with and , he was widely regarded as one of the \"Big Three\" of Flemish critical journalism." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johan_Anthierens> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Fitzpatrick> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Gerard Fitzpatrick (June 28, 1963 â€“ January 6, 2020) was an American attorney and politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district from 2005 to 2007 and 2011 to 2017. He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and represented the district from 2005 to 2007, but he was defeated by Democrat Patrick Murphy in 2006. He declined to run for his old seat in 2008 but ran again in 2010, and won a rematch with Murphy. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. A supporter of term limits, he did not seek re-election in 2016 and was replaced by his brother Brian. He was considered a moderate Republican, and consistently ranked among the most bipartisan members of Congress." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Fitzpatrick> .

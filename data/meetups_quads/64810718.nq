Largely self-taught on cello and upright bass before studying music at the University of North Texas in Denton, Verrill became a key component across a number of indie bands in Austin as well as a founding member of the Austin-based Annie Street Arts Collective. In 2015 she began performing her own material seriously as part of the experimental folk duo Little Mazarn featuring unusual instrumentation of banjo and musical saw. She has performed with Ethan Azarian, Califone, Dana Falconberry, Patty Griffin, Thor Harris, Will Johnson, Longriver, Possessed by Paul James, some say Leland, Charlie Sexton, the Weird Weeds, and Ralph White. In 2017, she traveled to Germany, France, Japan, and Canada as a part of the ATX6." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lindsey_Verrill> .

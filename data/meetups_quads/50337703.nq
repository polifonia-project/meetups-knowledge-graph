<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shea_Serrano> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Shea Serrano is an American author, journalist, and former teacher. He is best known for his work with the sports and pop culture websites, The Ringer and Grantland, as well as his books, including The Rap Year Book, Basketball (and Other Things) and Movies (and Other Things), all of which were The New York Times #1 best-sellers. Writing about Serrano for GQ, Chris Gayomali said: \"If you were to draw a triple Venn diagram of hoops, trunk bangers, and jokes made at the expense of J. Cole, Grantland writer Shea Serrano would be smack-dab in the center, probably wearing a Tim Duncan jersey.\" Serrano's activity and humor on Twitter have earned a devoted following, nicknamed the FOH Army." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shea_Serrano> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timothy_Drury> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Timothy Drury (born July 5, 1961) is an American composer, keyboardist, guitarist, vocalist, songwriter and visual artist. His big breakthrough came in 1989 when Don Henley invited him to join The End of the Innocence tour as his pianist, keyboardist and backup vocalist. A few years later, he was back on tour playing keyboard, guitar and singing backup vocals with the Eagles for their \"Hell Freezes Over\" reunion, a tour that lasted from 1994 to 2000. He toured for seven years with the rock band Whitesnake, and with a friendly departure in September 2010, he left the band to pursue a solo career. As a composer, lyricist and songwriter, Drury has several co-writes to his credit, including music with guitarist Don Felder, formerly with the Eagles, songs with Henley and Scott F. Crago, and with Stevie Nicks and Crago. His father is the late James Drury, best known for his starring role in the TV series, The Virginian." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timothy_Drury> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joan_Morgan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joan Morgan (1 February 1905 â€“ 22 July 2004) was an English film actress, screenwriter and novelist. Born in Forest Hill, London, she was the daughter of film director Sidney Morgan and his wife, Evelyn. Joan Morgan died at age 99 in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, UK in 2004. She became a leading British star of the 1920s, after appearing in a number of films directed by her father. Her acting career was effectively ended by the arrival of sound film in 1929 and she switched to writing, working on a number of screenplays over the following decade. She also wrote for television. She wrote novels under her own name and through using the pen-names Iris North and Joan Wentworth Wood." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joan_Morgan> .

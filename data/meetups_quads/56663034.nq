<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eureka_O'Hara> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eureka, also known as Eureka O'Hara and Eureka!, is the stage name of David Huggard (born August 26, 1990), an American drag queen and reality television personality. Eureka rose to prominence competing on the ninth and tenth seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race. They were removed from the ninth season of Drag Race due to a knee injury, becoming the first contestant in the history of the show to be sent home due to injury; they were then given an automatic berth to season 10, where they placed as runner-up. In 2021, Eureka competed on the sixth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, where they once more placed as a runner-up. Since 2020, Eureka has co-hosted We're Here on HBO alongside fellow Drag Race contestants Bob the Drag Queen and Shangela. The series has received acclaim from critics." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eureka_O'Hara> .

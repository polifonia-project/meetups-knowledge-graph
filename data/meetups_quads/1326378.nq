An offensive assistant for the majority of his coaching career, he came to prominence as the Dallas Cowboys' offensive coordinator during their consecutive Super Bowls victories in Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII. In addition to his assistant coaching, Turner served as the head coach of the Washington Redskins from 1994 to 2000, the Oakland Raiders from 2004 to 2005, and the San Diego Chargers from 2007 to 2012. Turner compiled 118 wins during his head coaching tenure, which are the most for an NFL head coach with a losing record. He is also the only NFL head coach with 100 wins to have a losing record." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norv_Turner> .

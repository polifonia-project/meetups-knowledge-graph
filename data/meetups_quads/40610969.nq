Farren recently launched his 16th release, most recently on his own FMan Media label, which was established in 1999, and been dedicated to managing his CD and publishing catalog. Charlie's full-time musical career began in 1973 and continued until 1989 when he postponed his full-time music-career pursuit to raise a family. He continued to perform as a solo in top Boston-area listening room venues, and continued to write and release CD every 18 â€“ 24 months. After a 24-year career at Hewlett Packard, Charlie retired and has resumed his full-time focus on creating original and compelling musical works. He has succeeded in re-establishing a successful career as a solo artist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlie_Farren> .

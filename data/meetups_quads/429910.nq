<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Kuralt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Bishop Kuralt (September 10, 1934 – July 4, 1997) was an American television, newspaper and radio journalist and author. He is most widely known for his long career with CBS, first for his \"On the Road\" segments on The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, and later as the first anchor of CBS News Sunday Morning, a position he held for fifteen years. In 1996, Kuralt was inducted into Television Hall of Fame of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. Kuralt's On the Road segments were recognized twice with personal Peabody Awards. The first, awarded in 1968, cited those segments as heartwarming and \"nostalgic vignettes.\" In 1975, his award was for his work as a U.S. \"bicentennial historian\"; his work \"capture[d] the individuality of the people, the dynamic growth inherent in the area, and…the rich heritage of this great nation.\" Kuralt also won an Emmy Award for On the Road in 1978. He shared in a third Peabody awarded to CBS News Sunday Morning in 1979." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Kuralt> .

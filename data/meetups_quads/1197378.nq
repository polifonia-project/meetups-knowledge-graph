<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_IV_of_Cyprus> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hugh IV (1293-1296 â€“ 10 October 1359) was King of Cyprus from 31 March 1324 to his abdication, on 24 November 1358 and, nominally, King of Jerusalem, as Hugh II, until his death. The son of Guy, Constable of Cyprus (son of Hugh III of Cyprus), and Eschiva of Ibelin, Hugh succeeded his father as Constable of Cyprus in 1318, and later succeeded to the throne of Cyprus on the death of his uncle Henry II, since Henry II had no son. He was a member of the House of Poitiers-Lusignan. The Kingdom of Cyprus reached the peak of its power and prosperity during the reigns of Hugh IV and Peter I." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_IV_of_Cyprus> .

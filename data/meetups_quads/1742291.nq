<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Timony> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Bozana Timony (born October 17, 1970) is an American independent singer-songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist, and violist. She has been a member of the bands Helium, Autoclave and Wild Flag, and currently fronts Ex Hex. Timony's music is often heavy and dark, frequently using drones, beats, and modal melodies reminiscent of European Medieval music. She uses a number of alternate guitar tunings, most prominent of which is DADGAE. Her unique style has been cited as an influence amongst well respected and admired musicians such as Carrie Brownstein of Sleater-Kinney, Sadie Dupuis of Speedy Ortiz and many more." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Timony> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emily_Lloyd> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Emily Alice Lloyd-Pack (born 29 September 1970), known as Emily Lloyd, is an English actress. At the age of 16, she starred in her debut and breakthrough role in the 1987 film Wish You Were Here, for which she received critical acclaim and Best Actress awards from the National Society of Film Critics and the Evening Standard British Film Awards. She subsequently relocated to Manhattan at 17, received numerous film offers, and starred in the 1989 films Cookie and In Country. Lloyd's mental health began to decline in her late teens, and she missed out on several prominent roles due to a combination of factors. She turned down the lead role in the 1990 film Pretty Woman as she had already agreed to star in Mermaids, from which she was later recast. She was fired from the 1992 film Husbands and Wives as her deteriorating health affected her ability to work, and was also replaced in the 1995 film Tank Girl. In 1997, a journalist said Lloyd was \"in danger of becoming better known for the parts she has lost than those she has played\". Though she continued to act in films during this time, she was mostly relegated to supporting roles. Lloyd's mental health continued to deteriorate in later years. While she played the lead role in the 2002 independent film The Honeytrap to critical acclaim, and also performed in theatrical productions, she had difficulty finding work and was diagnosed with several mental health conditions. By 2013, Lloyd's health had stabilised. That same year she published an autobiography, Wish I Was There." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emily_Lloyd> .

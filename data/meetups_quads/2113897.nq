<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patricia_Morison> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eileen Patricia Augusta Fraser Morison (March 19, 1915 â€“ May 20, 2018) was an American stage, television and film actress of the Golden Age of Hollywood and mezzo-soprano singer. She made her feature film debut in 1939 after several years on the stage, and amongst her most renowned were The Fallen Sparrow, Dressed to Kill opposite Basil Rathbone and the screen adaptation of The Song of Bernadette. She was lauded as a beauty with large blue eyes and extremely long, dark hair. During this period of her career, she was often cast as the femme fatale or \"other woman\". It was only when she returned to the Broadway stage that she achieved her greatest success as the lead in the original production of Cole Porter's Kiss Me, Kate and subsequently in The King and I. Passing away shortly before Kirk Douglas and Olivia de Havilland, Morison was one of the last survivors of the golden age of Hollywood." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patricia_Morison> .

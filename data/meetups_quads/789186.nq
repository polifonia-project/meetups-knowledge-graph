<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Coolen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nancy Anna Francina Coolen, known as Nance (born 10 September 1973 in Asten, North Brabant, Netherlands) is a Dutch TV host who was previously the lead-singer of a Eurodance group called Twenty 4 Seven. At the age of 15, Nance was discovered in a discoth√®que by dance-producer . He created the dance-act Twenty 4 Seven, in which Nance performs along with rapper Tony Dawson-Harrison, more commonly known by his stage name, Captain Hollywood. When the latter left the project and was replaced by rapper the act scored its biggest hits, like Slave to the Music. In 1996 Nance decided to leave Twenty 4 Seven to start up a solo-career, which led to a couple of small hits in The Netherlands. Around the same time she began working as a TV host for several channels. She hosted the Dutch Top 40 a couple of times for TMF Nederland. A little later she did the love quiz Liefde is... for RTL 5. In 1999 she started hosting the game show Rappatongo for TROS. After 200 episodes the show was cancelled. Nance started hosting the game show Lingo which she did until late 2005 when she decided to host programmes for SBS 6. Nance was married to William Rutten from 4 May 1995 until March 2000, when they divorced. She now has a relationship with Pico van Sytzama." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Coolen> .

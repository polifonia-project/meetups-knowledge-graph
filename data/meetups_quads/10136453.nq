<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pekka_Haavisto> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pekka Olavi Haavisto (born 23 March 1958) is a Finnish politician of the Green League who has been serving as the Minister for Foreign Affairs since 2019. Haavisto returned to the Finnish Parliament in the Finnish parliamentary election of March 2007 after an absence of 12 years and was re-elected in 2011, 2015, and 2019. Between April 1995 and April 1999 he was the Minister of Environment in the Lipponen I Cabinet. In October 2013 he was appointed as the Minister for International Development after Heidi Hautala resigned from the job. He has also been a member of the Helsinki City Council. He was also a candidate for the 2012 Finnish presidential election and 2018 Finnish presidential election coming second and losing to Sauli Niinistö in both times. Haavisto became the first openly gay candidate to run for the presidency of Finland. In December 2020, the Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee found that foreign minister Haavisto, who had pushed for Finnish children from the al-Hawl refugee camp to be brought to Finland, had broken Finnish law by trying to replace a foreign ministry official who refused to act after a difference of opinion over the repatriation. However, the Committee declared it had not found reason to bring criminal charges against him. Afterwards, the parliament had a vote of confidence on Haavisto. The result was 101–68 in favor of Haavisto. Only one government party member, Hannu Hoskonen of the Centre party, voted \"no confidence\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pekka_Haavisto> .

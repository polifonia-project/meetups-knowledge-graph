<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Brown_(Canadian_politician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "George Brown (November 29, 1818 â€“ May 9, 1880) was a British-Canadian journalist, politician and one of the Fathers of Confederation; attended the Charlottetown (September 1864) and Quebec (October 1864) conferences. A noted Reform politician, he is best known as the founder and editor of the Toronto Globe, Canada's most influential newspaper at the time, and his leadership in the founding of the Liberal Party in 1867. He was an articulate champion of the grievances and anger of Upper Canada (Ontario). He played a major role in securing national unity. His career in active politics faltered after 1865, but he remained a powerful spokesman for the Liberal Party. He promoted westward expansion and opposed the policies of Conservative Prime Minister John A. Macdonald." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Brown_(Canadian_politician)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheila_Ferguson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sheila Diana Ferguson (born October 8, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and author. She was the second longest-serving member of the 1970s American female soul music group The Three Degrees, singing lead vocals on most of the group's biggest hits, most notably \"When Will I See You Again\", which had international success topping the UK Singles Chart and peaking at #2 in the US. Following her departure from The Three Degrees in 1986, Ferguson went on to have her own solo singing career, touring internationally, making multiple TV appearances, and releasing a solo album titled A New Kind of Medicine. She has forged a prolific stage and screen career in the UK, starring in numerous musicals, soul legend tours, and her own sitcom Land of Hope and Gloria. She is also the best-selling author of Soul Food: Classic Cuisine from the Deep South. After getting married in 1980, she had settled in England since then and her entertainment career has been all exclusively in England and she is so far the first African American immigrant settled in England to be very locally famous in terms of acting and singing though some of her fame has also spread to other surrounding European countries as well, but meanwhile she has not had any media attention recognition in her home country of The US or either very limited after she settled in England. The only time she had wide media recognition in her home country of The US was in the early to mid 1970s when she was with The Three Degrees and when they had released their album called The Three Degrees, which included their most famous international hit song When Will I See You Again." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheila_Ferguson> .

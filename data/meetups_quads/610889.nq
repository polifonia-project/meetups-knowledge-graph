<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macky_Sall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Macky Sall (French pronunciation: â€‹[maki sal], Pulaar: ðž¤ƒðž¤¢ðž¤³ðž¤­ ðž¤…ðž¤¢ðž¤¤â€Ž, romanized: Maki Sal; born 11 December 1961) is a Senegalese politician who has been President of Senegal since April 2012. He was re-elected President in the first round voting in February 2019. Under President Abdoulaye Wade, Sall was Prime Minister of Senegal from July 2004 to June 2007 and President of the National Assembly from June 2007 to November 2008. He was the Mayor of Fatick from 2002 to 2008 and held that post again from 2009 to 2012. Sall was a long-time member of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS). After coming into conflict with Wade, he was removed from his post as President of the National Assembly in November 2008; he consequently founded his own party named the Alliance for the Republic (APR) and joined the opposition. Placing second in the first round of the 2012 presidential election, he won the backing of other opposition candidates and prevailed over Wade in the second round of voting, held on 25 March 2012. He is the first president born after Senegalese independence from France." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macky_Sall> .

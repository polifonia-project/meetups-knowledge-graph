In 2007, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Irvin played college football at the University of Miami and was selected in the first round of the 1988 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He spent his entire 12-year National Football League (NFL) career (1988-1999) with the Cowboys before his career ended with an October 10, 1999 cervical spine injury in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles at Veterans Stadium. Irvin was nicknamed \"the Playmaker\" due to his penchant for making big plays in big games during his college and pro careers. He is one of three key Cowboys offensive players, along with Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, known as \"The Triplets\" who led the Cowboys to three Super Bowl championships in 1992, 1993, and 1995. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wide receivers of all time. Irvin is a former broadcaster for ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown and currently an analyst for NFL Network. In 2009, he competed in season 9 of Dancing with the Stars and was the ninth contestant to be eliminated." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Irvin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fidel_V._Ramos> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Fidel Valdez Ramos CCLH GCS KGCR (Spanish: [fiˈðel βalˈdes ra.mos], Tagalog: [pɪˈdɛl bɐlˈdɛs ˈɾɐmos]; March 18, 1928 – July 31, 2022), popularly known as FVR and Eddie Ramos, was a Filipino general and politician who served as the 12th president of the Philippines from 1992 to 1998. He was the only career military officer who reached the rank of five-star general/admiral de jure. Rising from second lieutenant to commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Ramos was widely credited and admired by many for revitalizing and renewing international confidence in the Philippine economy during his six years in office. He is the third oldest to assume the presidency, together with the current 17th president, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., next to Sergio Osmeña and Rodrigo Duterte. Ramos rose through the ranks in the Philippine military early in his career and became Chief of the Philippine Constabulary and Vice Chief-of-Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos. During the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, Ramos was hailed as a hero by many Filipinos for his decision to break away from the administration of Marcos, and pledge allegiance and loyalty to the newly established government of President Corazon Aquino. Prior to his election as president, Ramos served in the cabinet of President Corazon Aquino, first as chief-of-staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and later as Secretary of National Defense from 1986 to 1991. He was credited with the creation of the Philippine Army's Special Forces and the Philippine National Police Special Action Force. After his retirement, he remained active in politics, serving as adviser to his successors. He died at the age of 94 from complications of COVID-19." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fidel_V._Ramos> .

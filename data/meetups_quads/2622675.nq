<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jed_O'Toole> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jed \"Mondo\" O'Toole (born 14 December 1962) was one of the original members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood alongside his brother Mark. Jed left the band making way for his cousin, Brian Nash (known as Nasher) before the band's first album. However, Jed re-joined the band for its worldwide tours in 1984 and 1987 as the 6th Frankie. For the band's 2004 reunion, Jed has replaced Nasher as the band's lead guitarist. The guitar he used during the tour of the reunion belonged to Vin O'Toole, one of his other brothers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jed_O'Toole> .

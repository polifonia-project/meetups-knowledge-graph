<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blind_Joe_Reynolds> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "\"Blind Joe\" Reynolds (1900 or 1904 â€“ March 10, 1968), was an American singer-songwriter and blues guitarist. Reynolds is thought to have been born in Tallulah, Louisiana in 1904, although his death certificate states his birthplace as Arkansas in 1900. He was blinded by a shotgun blast to the face in Louisiana in the mid-late 1920s, which resulted in the physical loss of his eyes. Despite this handicap, Blind Joe became known for his distinctive bottleneck style as well as his reported accuracy with a pistol, with which it is said he could judge the position of a target by sound alone. Reynolds is known to have been polyamorous and somewhat misogynistic, as is apparent from a number of his recordings. He was also known to be outspoken and flamboyant, often using his music as a medium to attack society." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blind_Joe_Reynolds> .

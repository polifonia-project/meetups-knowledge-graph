<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Johnson_(boxer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "\"Battling\" Jim Johnson (September 2, 1887 â€“ November 1, 1918) was an American boxer who fought as a heavyweight from 1908 to 1918. He had little success and lost with great frequency to top boxers such as Sam Langford, Joe Jeanette, Sam McVey, Harry Wills and Kid Norfolk. In spite of this, Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight champion, gave him a title shot. When they fought in Paris in August 1913, it was the first time that two black boxers had fought for the world heavyweight title. Battling Jim was the only black fighter Johnson faced during his reign as heavyweight champ from 1908 to 1915." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Johnson_(boxer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Lauer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Matthew Todd Lauer (/laʊər/; born December 30, 1957) is an American former television news personality, best known for his work with NBC News. After serving as a local news personality in New York City on WNBC, his first national exposure was as the news anchor for The Today Show from 1994 to 1997. In 1997, he was moved from the news desk to the host's chair, and served as the co-host of NBC's Today show from 1997 to 2017. He was also a frequent contributor for the evening news magazine Dateline NBC. With NBC, Lauer hosted the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and co-hosted the opening ceremonies of several Olympic Games. Following allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, Lauer's contract was terminated by NBC in November 2017 after the network reported receiving \"a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\" and added that the network had \"reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Lauer> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahmed_Subhy_Mansour> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ahmed Subhy Mansour (Arabic: أحمد صبحي منصور; born March 1, 1949) is an Egyptian American activist, Islamic Quranist scholar dealing with Islamic history, culture, theology, and politics. He founded a small Egyptian Quranist group that is neither Sunni nor Shia, was exiled from Egypt, and lives in the United States as a political refugee. Mansour was an advocate for democracy and human rights in Egypt for many years, during which time he was isolated by Islamic extremist clerics and persecuted by the government. He was arrested and served time in prison for his liberal political, religious, and social views. In May 1985, Mansour was discharged from his teaching and research position due to his liberal views, which were not acceptable to the religious authorities who controlled much of university policies and programs. Mansour sought and was granted political asylum in the United States in 2002. He has served as a visiting fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy, and at the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School. Sheikh Mansour was fired from Al-Azhar University after expressing his Quranist views. One of Mansour's fellow Islamic scholars at Al Azhar University Sheik took up the same Quran alone stance." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahmed_Subhy_Mansour> .

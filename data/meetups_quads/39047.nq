<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Tork> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Halsten Thorkelson (February 13, 1942 – February 21, 2019), better known by his stage name Peter Tork, was an American musician and actor. He was best known as the keyboardist and bass guitarist of the Monkees and a co-star of the TV series The Monkees (1966–1968). Tork grew up in Connecticut and in the mid-1960s as part of the Greenwich Village folk scene in New York City, he befriended musician Stephen Stills. After moving to Los Angeles with Stills, he auditioned for a new musical television sitcom, The Monkees. The series ran from 1966 to 1968 and made Tork and his co-stars teen idols. In addition to albums released with the band, Tork released one solo album, Stranger Things Have Happened (1994), and later toured with James Lee Stanley as well as his band, Shoe Suede Blues." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Tork> .

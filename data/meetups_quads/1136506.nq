<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Onslow_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "André George(s) Louis Onslow (27 July 1784 – 3 October 1853) was a French composer of English descent. His wealth, position and personal tastes allowed him to pursue a path unfamiliar to most of his French contemporaries, more similar to that of his contemporary German romantic composers; his music also had a strong following in Germany and in England. His principal output was chamber music, but he also wrote four symphonies and four operas. Onslow was esteemed by critics of his time, but his reputation declined swiftly after his death. It has only been revived in recent years." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Onslow_(composer)> .

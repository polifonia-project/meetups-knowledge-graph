<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kanan_Makiya> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kanan Makiya (born 1949) is an Iraqi-American academic and a professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at Brandeis University. He gained international attention writing the 1989 book Republic of Fear, which became a best-seller after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, and Cruelty and Silence (1991), a critique of the Arab intelligentsia. Makiya would later lobby the U.S. government to invade Iraq in 2003 in order to oust Hussein's regime. Makiya was born in Baghdad and left Iraq to study architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, later working for his father's architectural firm, Makiya & Associates which had branch offices in London and across the Middle East. As a former exile, he was a prominent member of the Iraqi opposition, a \"close friend\" of Ahmed Chalabi, and an influential proponent of the post-2003 Iraq War effort." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kanan_Makiya> .

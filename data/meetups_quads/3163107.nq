<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muricy_Ramalho> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Muricy Ramalho (born 30 November 1955) is a Brazilian former football coach and player who is the current sporting director of São Paulo. During his playing career, he was as an attacking midfielder. His most recent position was as manager of Flamengo, until health issues forced him to step down in 2017. Between 2006 and 2008, Ramalho led São Paulo to three consecutive national championships. In 2010, he also led Fluminense to the title. On July 23, 2010, it was reported that he had been offered the post of the coach of the Brazil national team, to replace the sacked Dunga. His team at the time, however, Fluminense, refused to release him for the job. Ramalho is also known by his paulistano accent, usually speaking expressions from this dialect." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muricy_Ramalho> .

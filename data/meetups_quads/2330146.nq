<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_Brown_(cricketer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Thomas Brown (20 August 1869 â€“ 4 November 1904) known as Jack Brown, was an English professional cricketer, who played primarily as a batsman. He was Yorkshire's first great opening batsman, a lineage continued by Herbert Sutcliffe, Len Hutton and Geoffrey Boycott. He took five wickets in an innings on three occasions with his leg breaks, but except in 1901 (when he claimed 57 wickets) he generally bowled little." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_Brown_(cricketer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Bethune> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Captain Peter James Bethune (born 4 April 1965) is a New Zealand ship's captain with 500 ton master licence, published author, producer of The Operatives TV show, and public speaker. He is the founder of Earthrace Conservation. He works assisting countries in Asia, Central America and Africa with fisheries enforcement and anti-poaching. He is the holder of the world record for circumnavigating the globe in his powerboat Earthrace, a wavepiercing trimaran powered with biofuels. Earthrace was renamed the Ady Gil in 2009 and Bethune sailed it in Antarctica for Sea Shepherd Conservation Society[1] to disrupt Japanese whaling activities. The vessel was subsequently rammed by the Shonan Maru 2, a Japanese whaling vessel. Bethune subsequently boarded the Shonan Maru 2, presented the Captain with an invoice for the Ady Gil and attempted to arrest him. Bethune was detained, taken back to Japan and charged with a number of offences related to his trespassing and assault. He received a suspended sentence. In 2012, Bethune started Earthrace Conservation, which works on conservation and environmental campaigns. His team consists of former military personnel, and they are involved in fisheries enforcement, anti-poaching, and stopping wildlife smuggling. Many of the missions have been filmed and made into the TV series The Operatives, which has now aired in around 90 countries. More recently Bethune's work has involved training government teams on coastal and offshore surveillance, fisheries enforcement, and maritime security. In 2019 Bethune's non-profit Earthrace Conservation purchased the former US Navy and USCG ship Modoc, which his team converted into a conservation support vessel. The vessel has a Zodiac Milpro FC470, a Willard 7.4m RIB, a 7m barge, and a Schiebel S100 Camcopter UAV. The ship was taken to Costa Rica in 2020 where she supports the Government Environmental Agency SINAC in various campaigns protecting Costa Rica's national parks. In January 2021, while on patrol in Piedras Blancas National Park in Costa Rica, Bethune was bitten by a deadly Fer-de-lance snake. He was taken to Golfito Hospital and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. He was released from hospital 2 weeks later, but with some ongoing health issues related to the snake bite and subsequent treatment." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Bethune> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jessie_Matthews> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jessie Margaret Matthews OBE (11 March 1907 â€“ 19 August 1981) was an English actress, dancer and singer of the 1920s and 1930s, whose career continued into the post-war period. After a string of hit stage musicals and films in the mid-1930s, Matthews developed a following in the USA, where she was dubbed \"The Dancing Divinity\". Her British studio was reluctant to let go of its biggest name, however, which resulted in offers for her to work in Hollywood being repeatedly rejected. After the decline of her film career, Matthews achieved a comeback in her native Britain when she took over the role of Mary Dale in the popular BBC Radio serial The Dales (previously known as Mrs Dale's Diary)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jessie_Matthews> .

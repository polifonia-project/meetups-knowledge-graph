<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chungseon_of_Goryeo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chungseon of Goryeo (20 October 1275 – 23 June 1325) (r. 1298 and 1308 – 1313), born Wang Won (Hangul: 왕원, Hanja: 王謜), later changed his name to Wang Jang (Hangul: 왕장, Hanja: 王璋), was the 26th ruler of the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea. He is sometimes known by his Mongolian name, Ijir Bukhqa (Hangul: 익지례보화, Hanja: 益知禮普花, Romanization: Ikjiryebohwa). Adept at calligraphy and painting, rather than politics, he generally preferred the life in Khanbaliq (the capital of the Yuan Empire, present-day Beijing) to that in Gaegyeong (the capital of Goryeo, present-day Kaesong). He was the eldest son of King Chungryeol; his mother was Queen Jangmok, a daughter of Kublai Khan, also known by her Mongolian name, Borjigin Qutlugh Kelmysh." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chungseon_of_Goryeo> .

Previously he produced and engineered the first three Death by Stereo records, which is probably why the band's fourth album Death for Life, was a noticeable departure from their regular sound. Paul was also in a band called Kill The Messenger, which was also signed to Indecision Records. Paul is the brother of , the original guitarist, who left the band during the recording of Death by Stereo's third album Into the Valley of Death.

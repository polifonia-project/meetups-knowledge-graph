<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rachel_Scott> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rachel Joy Scott (August 5, 1981 â€“ April 20, 1999) was an American student who was the first fatality of the Columbine High School massacre, in which 11 other students and a teacher were also murdered by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who then died by suicide. Scott's belief in Christianity and the circumstances of her death have led to her being remembered by groups of evangelical Christians as a Christian martyr. She was posthumously the subject and co-writer of several books and the inspiration for Rachel's Challenge, an international school outreach program and the most popular school assembly program in the U.S. The aim of Rachel's Challenge is to advocate Scott's values, based on her life, her journals, and the contents of a two-page essay, penned a month before her murder, entitled My Ethics; My Codes of Life. This essay advocates her belief in compassion being \"the greatest form of love humans have to offer\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rachel_Scott> .

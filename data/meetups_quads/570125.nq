<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kirk_Gibson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kirk Harold Gibson (born May 28, 1957) is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He is currently a color commentator for the Detroit Tigers on Bally Sports Detroit and a special assistant for the Tigers. As a player, Gibson was an outfielder who batted and threw left-handed. He spent most of his career with the Detroit Tigers, and also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kansas City Royals, and Pittsburgh Pirates. While with the Dodgers, Gibson was named the National League MVP in 1988. During his career, he hit two dramatic home runs in the World Series, each one coming against an eventual Hall of Fame relief pitcher. With the Tigers in 1984, he clinched the title in Game Five with a three-run homer off Goose Gossage, who had refused to walk him with a base open. With the Dodgers in 1988, Gibson faced closer Dennis Eckersley in the ninth inning of the first game and hit a pinch-hit walk-off home runâ€”often described as one of the most exciting moments in World Series history. He was named to the All-Star team twice, in 1985 and 1988, but declined the invitation both times. Following his retirement as a player, he spent five seasons as a television analyst in Detroit and then became a coach for the Tigers in 2003. He became the Diamondbacks' bench coach in 2007 and was promoted to interim manager in 2010 following the mid-season dismissal of A. J. Hinch. On October 4, 2010, the Diamondbacks removed the \"interim\" label, naming Gibson their manager for the 2011 season. He served as the Diamondbacks' manager until September 26, 2014. Gibson returned to the broadcast booth in 2015 as a part-time commentator for Tigers TV broadcasts, and was named a regular television analyst for the Tigers in 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kirk_Gibson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_Anne-Marie_of_Greece> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anne-Marie, RE (Greek: Άννα-Μαρία pronounced [ana maˈria]; born 30 August 1946) is a Greek and Danish royal who was the last Queen of Greece from 1964 to 1973 as the wife of King Constantine II. The Greek monarchy was abolished with the 1974 Greek Republic Referendum. Born Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, she is the youngest daughter of King Frederick IX of Denmark and his wife Ingrid of Sweden. In 1964 she married King Constantine and became queen consort of Greece. During her tenure as Queen of Greece, Anne-Marie spent much of her time working for a charitable foundation known as \"Her Majesty's Fund\" and later as the \"Anne-Marie Foundation\", which provided assistance to people in rural areas of Greece. In 1967, however, the king and queen were forced into exile and later deposed as Greece transitioned into a Republic. Anne-Marie is the youngest sister of the reigning Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. She is also a first cousin of the reigning King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, and a second cousin of the reigning King Harald V of Norway. Anne-Marie and her husband Constantine are third cousins: they share King Christian IX of Denmark as patrilineal great-great-grandfather. They also share Queen Victoria as a great-great-grandmother. They have five children: Princess Alexia, Crown Prince Pavlos, Prince Nikolaos, Princess Theodora, and Prince Philippos." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen_Anne-Marie_of_Greece> .

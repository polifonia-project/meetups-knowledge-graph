<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mack_David> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mack David (July 5, 1912 – December 30, 1993) was an American lyricist and songwriter, best known for his work in film and television, with a career spanning the period between the early 1940s and the early 1970s. David was credited with writing lyrics or music or both for over one thousand songs. He was particularly well known for his work on the Disney films Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland, and for the mostly-English lyrics through which Édith Piaf's signature song \"La Vie en rose\" gained much of its familiarity among native speakers of English. David was the elder brother of American lyricist and songwriter Hal David. David died in 1993 in his Rancho Mirage, California home and his remains are buried at the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mack_David> .

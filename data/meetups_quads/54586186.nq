He was a major contributor and technical advisor to The Art of Rock by Paul Grushkin, which was released in 1987, and has become the standard reference book on rock posters of the 1960s and 1970s. Grushkin and King co-authored the follow-up book, The Art of Modern Rock: The Poster Explosion in 2004, on which King was Art Director. More than 1,800 posters were reproduced in Art of Modern Rock: The Poster Explosion, which detailed the resurgence and expansion of the art form's phenomenon, its style, and influence. The book also featured a discussion of the history of silk-screening and its commercial applications following its industrialization, featuring the work of artists like Frank Kozik, Uncle Charlie, Art Chantry, and Yee Haw Industries. The French edition, Lâ€™Art du Rock, was released in 2005. King was the sole author on a pair of follow-up books, Art of Rock Mini #1: A-Z (2007) and Art of Rock Mini #2: Poster Girls (2008), both of which included new material and were published in smaller, more economical and accessible formats. He also wrote the epilogue to the 2008 book The Hammer of God: The Art of Malleus Rock Art Lab, a volume dedicated to the art collective consisting of three Italian poster artists whose work appeared in all three of the Art of Modern Rock books.." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_King_(author)> .

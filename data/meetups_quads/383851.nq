<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joey_Santiago> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joseph Alberto Santiago (born June 10, 1965) is a Filipino-American guitarist and composer. Active since 1986, Santiago is best known as the lead guitarist for the American alternative rock band Pixies. His signature style changed the sound of alt-rock and has served as a major influence in music to this day. After the band's breakup in 1993, Santiago produced musical scores for film and television documentaries, and he formed The Martinis with his ex-wife, Linda Mallari. He also contributed to albums by Charles Douglas and former Pixies band-mate Frank Black. Santiago resumed his role as the Pixies' lead guitarist when they reunited in 2004. Santiago has described his guitar technique as \"angular and bent\", and he cites Les Paul, George Harrison, Chet Atkins, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass and Jimi Hendrix as major influences on his style. His guitar playing, as part of the Pixies' sound, was held in high regard by critics: MTV's Laurel Bowman commented that Santiago's \"sonic plow was the key element in the Pixies' monstrous presence\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joey_Santiago> .

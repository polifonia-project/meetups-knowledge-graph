<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ilya_Yashin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ilya Valeryevich Yashin (Russian: Илья́ Вале́рьевич Я́шин, born 29 June 1983) is a Russian opposition politician who led the PARNAS party from 2012 to 2016, and now heads its Moscow branch. He presently maintains a local position in the Moscow municipal district of Krasnoselsky, of which he was the top official from 2017 to 2021. Yashin co-founded the civic youth movement Oborona in 2005 and later the political movement Solidarnost in 2008, of which he is still one of the leaders. He was an active participant in Dissenters' Marches and the 2011–13 Russian protests. In 2012 he was elected to the Russian Opposition Coordination Council. Amidst an increase in government crackdowns on the opposition following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, some considered Yashin to have had the largest platform of any opposition politician that had not either left the country, been imprisoned, or been killed. However, in June 2022, he was arrested, and later accused under the new war censorship laws of disseminating fake news about the Armed Forces." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ilya_Yashin> .

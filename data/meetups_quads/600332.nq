He is best known for his role as Dewey Riley in the slasher film franchise Scream, for which he won a Teen Choice Award and two Blockbuster Entertainment Awards. As a professional wrestler, he is best remembered for his 2000 stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and headlined the Slamboree pay-per-view event; he has received praise in recent times for his work on the independent circuit. A member of the Arquette acting family, he first became known during the mid-1990s after starring in several Hollywood films aside from the Scream franchise, such as Wild Bill, Never Been Kissed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, See Spot Run and Eight Legged Freaks. He has since had several television roles, such as Jason Ventress on ABC's In Case of Emergency. Arquette has also voiced Skully on the Disney Channel animated series Jake and the Never Land Pirates, and executive produced the game show Celebrity Name Game, for which he received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Arquette> .

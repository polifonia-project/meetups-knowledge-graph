<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Waterhouse> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Graham Waterhouse (born 2 November 1962) is an English composer and cellist, focused on chamber music. For his own instrument, he has composed a cello concerto, Three Pieces for Solo Cello and Variations for Cello Solo. He has written string quartets and compositions which juxtapose a quartet with a solo instrument, including Piccolo Quintet, Bassoon Quintet and the piano quintet Rhapsodie Macabre. He has set poetry for speaking voice and cello, such as Der Handschuh, and has written song cycles. His compositions reflect the individual capacity and character of players and instruments, from piccolo to contrabassoon. Since 1998, Waterhouse has organised a concert series at the Gasteig in Munich, often playing with members of the Munich Philharmonic. His works have been performed internationally and several have been recorded. He has been awarded prizes for several of his compositions, and has been composer in residence at institutions in European countries. He achieved a PhD from the University of Birmingham in 2018. From 2020, his compositions have been published by Schott." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Waterhouse> .

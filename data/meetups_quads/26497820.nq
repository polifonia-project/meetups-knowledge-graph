Among his notable pupils were composers Arrigo Boito, Benedetto Junck, Isidore de Lara, Antônio Carlos Gomes, and Ivan Zajc, sopranos Marcella Lotti della Santa and Marietta Gazzaniga, and tenor Sims Reeves. As a writer, he wrote articles for the Gazzetta musicale di Milano between 1845 and 1858. In 1859 he was appointed to the post of maestro direttore e concertatore at La Scala, a position he held until 1868. He died nine years later in Milan at the age of 64.

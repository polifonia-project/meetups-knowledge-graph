<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emel_Mathlouthi> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Emel Mathlouthi (Arabic: آمال المثلوثي) also known as Emel, born 11 January 1982), is a Tunisian singer-songwriter, musician, arranger and producer. She rose to fame with her protest song \"Kelmti Horra\" (\"My Word is Free\"), which became an anthem for the Tunisian revolution and the Arab spring. Her first studio album, also titled Kelmti Horra, was released worldwide in 2012 to critical acclaim: she married Arabic roots with western flavours. Her second album, Ensen, was released in 2017, blending more electronica to classical music. On Everywhere We Looked Was Burning in 2019, she sang all the lyrics in English. In 2020, the video of her song \"Holm\" (\"A Dream\") that she sings in Tunisian Arabic, has been viewed several millions in a matter of a few months. \"Holm\" was included in the double album The Tunis Diaries which she recorded on her own with just a voice, an acoustic guitar as the sole instrument and a laptop. She has also collaborated with other artists such as Tricky, Valgeir Sigurdsson, Steve Moore or Vitalic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emel_Mathlouthi> .

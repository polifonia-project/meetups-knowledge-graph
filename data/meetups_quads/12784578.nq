<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Greene_(dramatist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Greene (1558â€“1592) was an English author popular in his day, and now best known for a posthumous pamphlet attributed to him, Greene's Groats-Worth of Witte, bought with a million of Repentance, widely believed to contain an attack on William Shakespeare. Robert Greene was a popular Elizabethan dramatist and pamphleteer known for his negative critiques of his colleagues. He is said to have been born in Norwich. He attended Cambridge where he received a BA in 1580, and an M.A. in 1583 before moving to London, where he arguably became the first professional author in England. Greene was prolific and published in many genres including romances, plays and autobiography." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Greene_(dramatist)> .

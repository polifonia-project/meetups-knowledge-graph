<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fernando_Corena> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Fernando Corena (22 December 1916 â€“ 26 November 1984) was a Swiss bass who had a major international opera career from the late 1940s through the early 1980s. He enjoyed a long and successful career at the Metropolitan Opera between 1954 and 1978, and was a regular presence at the Vienna State Opera between 1963 and 1981. His repertoire encompassed both dramatic and comic roles in leading and secondary parts, mainly within Italian opera. He was highly regarded for his performances of opera buffa characters and is generally considered one of the greatest basso buffos of the post-war era. He was heralded as the true successor to comic Italian bass Salvatore Baccaloni, and in 1966 Harold C. Schonberg wrote in The New York Times that he was \"the outstanding buffo in action today and the greatest scene stealer in the history of opera\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fernando_Corena> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Pine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Leslie Beswetherick Pine (born 21 August 1949) is the author of critical works on the Irish playwright Brian Friel, the Anglo-Irish novelist Lawrence Durrell, and aspects of art music in Ireland. He worked for the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ Raidió Teilifís Éireann before moving to Greece in 2001 to found the Durrell School of Corfu, which he directed until 2010. From 2009 to 2020 he wrote a regular column on Greek affairs in The Irish Times and was also an obituarist for The Guardian. In 2012, to mark the centenary of the birth of Lawrence Durrell, Pine edited and introduced a previously unpublished novel by Durrell, Judith, set in 1940s Palestine. He has since edited a further novel by Durrell, The Placebo, and a two-volume edition of Durrell's ephemeral and hard-to-find material: plays, short novels, stories, diaries and travel writings. Lawrence Durrell described Pine's work as \"the best unpacking of my literary baggage I have heard.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Pine> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jody_Cortez> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jody Cortez (born 1960) is an American studio musician. A drummer, Cortez began his professional career at the age of 21 as a member of Boz Scaggs' live band in 1981. Cortez played drums on glam metal band Cinderella's 1986 debut album Night Songs after band drummer Jim Drnec was unable to complete the drum parts in studio and was fired. Fred Coury would later be hired as the band's permanent drummer. Though never an official member of Cinderella, the earliest pressing of Night Songs features a photo of Cortez on the back cover, though Coury was pictured on the album's front cover photo and listed as a band member in the liner notes. Cortez has worked with David Crosby and played on the live version of the hit single \"Hero\" by Crosby and Phil Collins. In 1994, Cortez toured with CSN for the 25th Anniversary Tour, including Woodstock 2. In December 2009, he was announced as the new drummer for Yoso, although he left the band early in 2010." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jody_Cortez> .

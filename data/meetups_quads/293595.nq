<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chuck_Schuldiner> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Schuldiner (born May 13, 1967 â€“ December 13, 2001) was an American musician. He founded the death metal band Death in 1983, in which he was the lead vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter and only consistent member until his death in 2001. His obituary in the January 5, 2002 issue of UK's Kerrang! magazine described him as \"one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.\" Schuldiner was ranked No. 10 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists in 2009 and No. 20 in March 2004 Guitar World's \"The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists\". In 1987, Schuldiner founded the publishing company Mutilation Music, affiliated with performance rights organization BMI. Schuldiner died in 2001 of a brain tumor. Schuldiner is often referred to as \"The Godfather of death metal\", although he was uncomfortable with this nickname, remarking that \"I don't think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chuck_Schuldiner> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_C._Schulte> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Christopher Schulte (born 1959) is an American writer, director, and producer of animation, toys and entertainment properties. He has developed many iconic intellectual properties from the 1980s, 1990s and on into the 21st-century. Working as a developer and writer, he served on the development team for the wildly popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which became a multibillion-dollar franchise internationally and has enjoyed several resurgences since its original inception by the comic book duo, Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. He provided seminal development for licensee, Playmates Toys, and contributed stories to the animated series, helmed by veteran satirist, Jack Mendelsohn. He developed the short-lived but treasured original toy and animation property, B.C. Bikers, about a rogue band of \"chrome age\" dinosaurs who ride motorcycles through their prehistoric end times. He worked on interpolating the Troma feature film, The Toxic Avenger into an animated program for kids, called Toxic Crusaders. In 2006, he worked with creator/producer, Rick Ungar, to develop Zorro: Generation Z. He penned a script for an introductory animated series called Gormiti: The Invincible Lords of Nature, based on the Italian toy phenomenon from Giochi Preziosi, which made its way to the United States via Playmates Toys, and debuted on Cartoon Network in 2009. Creating story content for digital products has resulted in Schulte's co-development of a number of noteworthy projects, including smart toys for Bandai America (Tamagotchi) and Playmates Toys (Nano). Schulte collaborates with his longtime writing partners, John C. Besmehn, Fred Fox Jr., and his wife, . Their business is Pangea Corporation where he serves as president." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_C._Schulte> .

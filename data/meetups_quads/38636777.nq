<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Bachenheimer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Theodore Herman Bachenheimer a.k.a. Theodor Storm, (23 April 1923 â€“ 22 October 1944), was an American soldier. In just three years, he achieved legendary status as one of the war's most daring reconnaissance scouts, he was better known as The Legendary Paratrooper or The G.I. General and was befriended by Martha Gellhorn. Private Bachenheimer had an extraordinary talent for war, but, in reality was a man of peace. 'In principle I am against any war,' he would say, 'I simply cannot hate anyone'. Held in high esteem by his fellow combatants, remembered by high ranking U.S Army officers, Lieut. General James M. Gavin once said of him,'His bravery was, beyond question, of an exceptional high order. Bachenheimer stood out more from the venturesome his bravery took than because of the bravery itself'. He chose to finish the task he started whatever the sacrifice. Bachenheimer, one of the most remarkable characters of his division, died at the age of twenty-one." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Bachenheimer> .

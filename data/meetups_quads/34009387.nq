<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Atkinson_(actor)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frank Atkinson (19 March 1893 in Blackpool, Lancashire â€“ 23 February 1963 in Pinner, Middlesex) was an English actor and writer. He appeared in at least 130 films between 1930 and 1963. A stalwart of British films, often in small or uncredited roles, and also in Hollywood in the 1930s, notably in the Raoul Walsh directed Me and My Gal and Sailor's Luck. Allmovie described him as \"tall and slender, and with gaunt facial features that lent themselves to looks of eccentricity, and with a highly cultured speaking voice, he could melt unobtrusively into a scene, as an anonymous bit-player, or could, with the utterance of a few words or a look, transform himself into a wryly comedic presence -- he played everything from jailers, guards, garage attendants, and soldiers to upper class twits.\" He was the first person to play the scarecrow Worzel Gummidge on television in the original series, broadcast by the BBC on 10 February 1953." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Atkinson_(actor)> .

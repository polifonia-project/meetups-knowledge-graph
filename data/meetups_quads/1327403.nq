He was born in Plymouth, England, and died in Halifax, Nova Scotia. According to historian Elizabeth Griffiths, Lawrence was seen as a \"competent\", \"efficient\" officer with a \"service record that had earned him fairly rapid promotion, a person of considerable administrative talent who was trusted by both Cornwallis and Hopson.\" He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul's Church (Halifax)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Lawrence_(British_Army_officer)> .

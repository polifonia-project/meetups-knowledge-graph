<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spencer_Dinwiddie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Spencer Gray Dinwiddie (born April 6, 1993) is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Colorado Buffaloes and earned first-team all-conference honors in the Pac-12 as a sophomore in 2013. He missed most of his junior year after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Dinwiddie recovered and was selected by the Detroit Pistons in the second round of the 2014 NBA draft. After two seasons with the Pistons, he joined the Brooklyn Nets in December 2016 and played with them until being traded to the Washington Wizards in 2021. In February 2022, Dinwiddie was traded to the Dallas Mavericks." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spencer_Dinwiddie> .

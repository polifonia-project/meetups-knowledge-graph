His debut album The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant was released on April 30, 2013, rising to number 8 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. His next two albums, Next to Nothing (2014) and Top of the Line (2016) peaked at number 3 on the same chart. His fourth album, Last Call (2017), hit number 43 on the Billboard 200. All of these were released under Tech N9ne's Strange Music label. Rittz fulfilled his four-album contract with Strange, then formed his own record label, CNT Entertainment, through which he released Put a Crown on It in 2019. The album reflects Rittz's battle to free himself from drug and alcohol addiction. The album hit number 6 on Billboard's Independent Albums chart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rittz> .

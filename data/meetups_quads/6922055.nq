Before TTF, Kiani was a session musician and has toured with Donny Osmond and performed vocals on The Simpsons' Yellow Album. In an interview with Lynne Hoggan on Pure Radio, Mary confirmed she is a \"professional musician\" and doesn't speak to any of her former band mates." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Kiani> .

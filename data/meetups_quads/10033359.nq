<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Degen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bruce Degen (born June 14, 1945) is an American illustrator and writer with over forty children's books to his credit. He may be known best for illustrating the series The Magic School Bus written by Joanna Cole. He has collaborated with writers Nancy White Carlstrom, on the Jesse Bear books, and Jane Yolen, on the Commander Toad series. Degen has authored Jamberry, Daddy Is a Doodlebug, and Shirley's Wonderful Baby. He was encouraged by an elementary school teacher to become an illustrator, and pursue his primary love for art found in childrenâ€™s books. Humor is one of his key values, as expressed by a quote comparing children's illustration to traditional fine arts: \"You don't see many people walking around a gallery are chuckling. And I realized that I wanted a chuckle.\" His career has included such diverse activities as advertising design, teaching art to students, teaching children's book illustration to adults, painting scenery for opera productions, and running a lithography studio in Israel. Degen lives in Connecticut." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Degen> .

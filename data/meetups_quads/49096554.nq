She was a part of the short-lived Korean R&B duo Isak N Jiyeon during 2002. After the duo disbanded in 2004, Lina eventually became a member of girl group The Grace in 2005. The group went on hiatus in 2010. Due to the group going on hiatus, Lee later established herself as a musical actress, notably through her participation in the original and Korean versions of stage musicals including Fame, Moon Embracing the Sun, Jekyll & Hyde, and Notre-Dame de Paris." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lina_(South_Korean_singer)> .

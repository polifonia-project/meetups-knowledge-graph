<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Roger_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roger Roger (5 August 1911 â€“ 12 June 1995) was a French composer of light orchestral music and film scores, as well as a conductor and bandleader. His aliases included Eric Swan and Cecil Leuter, the last being a pseudonym he used for his electronic music productions, of which he was somewhat of a pioneer. He is best known for his intricately composed and arranged orchestral contributions to commercial production music during the 1950s and 1960s, many of which have more recently achieved wider recognition. He helped revive the musical exotica genre with his album Jungle Obsession in 1971." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Roger_(composer)> .

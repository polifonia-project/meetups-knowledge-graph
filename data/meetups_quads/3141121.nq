<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sas_of_Moldavia> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sas was, according to the Slavo-Romanian chronicles, the second voivode of Moldavia (c. 1353/1360 – c. 1357/1364). He followed his father Dragoş who had been sent to Moldavia as a representative of king Louis I of Hungary to establish a line of defense against the Golden Horde. All chronicles show that he reigned four years. According to the sequence of the voivodes listed in the Slavo-Romanian chronicles, he was followed by Bogdan (who would become the first independent ruler of Moldavia), but several historians (e.g., Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol, Ştefan Pascu) consider Balc as his successor. Victor Spinei thinks that Bogdan came to Moldavia immediately after the death of Sas, before Balc was able to consolidate his reign. The Drágfi of Béltek family, whose estates would encompass over a hundred villages in the Kingdom of Hungary, descended from one of his sons, Drag." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sas_of_Moldavia> .

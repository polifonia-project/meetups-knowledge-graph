<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Usher> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frank Usher (born 4 August 1949, in Gateshead, County Durham, England) is an English guitarist best known for his work in Fish's band. Usher lives and operates a guitar-manufacturing business in Innerleithen, Scotland. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he has worked with a variety of artists including Mike Heron, John Martyn, Tam White and the locally noted Border Boogie Band. While playing in a band called Blewitt in 1980, he first met Fish who became their vocalist for a short time. When Fish left Marillion to start a solo career in 1988, he contacted Usher to become his guitarist. Since then he has played on seven Fish studio albums and the accompanying tours. Usher suffered a heart attack in December 2007, causing three gigs to be cancelled." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Usher> .

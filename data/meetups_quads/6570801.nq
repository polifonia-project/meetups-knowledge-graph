<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susan_Ann_Sulley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Susan Ann Sulley (born 22 March 1963), formerly known as Susanne Sulley and Susan Ann Gayle, is an English singer who is one of the two female vocalists in the synth-pop band The Human League. Born and raised in Sheffield, England, as a schoolgirl in 1980, Sulley (aged 17) and her friend Joanne Catherall were \"discovered\" in the Crazy Daisy Nightclub in Sheffield by Philip Oakey, the lead singer and a founding member of The Human League. They soon were asked to provide full vocals by Oakey as an experiment. Sulley is a joint business partner in the band, which still records and performs. The Human League has dominated Sulley's life; she has been a singer all her adult life and has never had any other full-time job. She explains: \"Joanne and I weren't ambitious; we didn't want to be in a pop group. We were just two girls at school who wanted to go to university.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susan_Ann_Sulley> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Green_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul Richard Green (born July 9, 1972) is an American record producer, film producer, director, screenwriter, singer-songwriter, music teacher, entrepreneur, and philanthropist who founded School of Rock (formerly known as The Paul Green School of Rock Music), a performance-based music program for kids. This for-profit educational company operates and sponsors franchises for after-school music instructional programs in the United States. First established in Philadelphia in 1998 by Paul Green, schools have opened in states including New York, Utah, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, D.C., Virginia, Florida, Georgia, Texas, Colorado, Delaware, Washington, New Jersey, and North Carolina and internationally in Mexico. In 2005, the company was the subject of a documentary film titled Rock School. In early 2010, Paul Green left the Paul Green School of Rock Music, which is now known as The School of Rock. On August 9, 2011, the Woodstock Film Festival announced that Green has moved to the Woodstock, New York area and has joined as the Music Coordinator. He is also working with Woodstock Festival co-founder Michael Lang in founding a music college in the Woodstock area. Green has also launched a weekly rock radio show on Radio Woodstock 100.1 WDST called \"The Tool Shed with Paul Green\" that airs on Saturday evenings from 7-9pm and streams online at RadioWoodstock.com." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Green_(musician)> .

Born in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Richardson graduated in 1938 from the University of North Carolina and then traveled through Europe (1938–39), returning to the University of North Carolina in 1940 for his M.A. From 1940 to 1942, he studied at the University of Iowa, where he wrote the play Barbara Allen (published in 1942), aka Night Song, inspired by the Scottish-English folk song, \"The Ballad of Barbara Allen\". He served with the Army in 1943." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Richardson_(playwright)> .

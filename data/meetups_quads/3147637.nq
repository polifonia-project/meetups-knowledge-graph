Her works have been seen on the street, in New York area galleries and institutions. Exhibitions include The Arts Center in St. Petersburg, Florida and New York’s Islip Art Museum. In 2008, Sciulli exhibited a solo installation with Frederieke Taylor Gallery, had her second solo show with Chi Contemporary Fine Art, exhibited her outdoor video installation, \"Everything's Rosie\" as part of Plugged-In (Hudson, New York) and was a recipient of a Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Grant to produce a roving outdoor video installation, Intercepting Planes X, in Duane Park (New York). Her collaborations with composers have been shown widely at European and American festivals. A recent collaboration featured her video and light work for the Mabou Mines waterfront piece, “Song for New York: What Women Do While Men Sit Knitting” by Ruth Maleczech, which was developed during her Sundance Institute Theatre Lab Residency at White Oak, Florida. Her 2005 solo show at Chi Contemporary, COVER, was a Village Voice Shortlist Choice: \"projections...imbued with fresh, though enigmatic, meaning through intelligently deployed technology (RC BAKER).\" She has been married to musician Carter Burwell since 1999." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christine_Sciulli> .

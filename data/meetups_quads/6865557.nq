<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virginio_Orsini> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gentile Virginio Orsini (c. 1434 â€“ 8 January 1497) was an Italian condottiero and vassal of the papal throne and the Kingdom of Naples, mainly remembered as the powerful head of the Orsini family during its feud with Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia). Though best known as Lord of Bracciano, during his lifetime he bore many titles, among which Count of Tagliacozzo, Vicovaro and Anguillara, Lord of Cerveteri, Knight of the Order of Emellino (1463), Constable of the Kingdom of Naples and Gonfalonier of the Roman Church. The aforesaid fiefs were all confiscated in favor of the Colonna or the Borgia family during Virginio's conflict with Naples and the Pope." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virginio_Orsini> .

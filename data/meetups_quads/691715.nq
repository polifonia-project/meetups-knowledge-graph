She portrayed fictional model Allegra Coleman in a 1996 Esquire magazine hoax and took on guest roles on several television shows in the 1990s. She made her film debut in Varsity Blues (1999), which was followed by the horror film House on Haunted Hill (1999). Her role as Clear Rivers in the first two films of the Final Destination franchise earned her a reputation as a scream queen. Larter played supporting roles in the comedy Legally Blonde (2001) and the romantic comedy A Lot Like Love (2005), and led the Bollywood movie Marigold (2007) and the thriller Obsessed (2009). She played the dual roles of Niki Sanders and Tracy Strauss on the NBC science fiction drama Heroes (2006â€“2010), and achieved wider recognition for her portrayal of video game heroine Claire Redfield in the Resident Evil: Extinction (2007), Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010), and Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016). As of April 2017, Larter's films have grossed over US$1.31 billion worldwide. Her presence in the media is reinforced by her appearances in lists compiled by Maxim, FHM, and Stuff, as well as People magazine's \"Best Dressed List\" in 2007. She released her cookbook, Kitchen Revelry: A Year of Festive Menus from My Home to Yours, in September 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ali_Larter> .

He started his career in 2015 and released several EPs and mixtapes before he was signed to Don Cannon and DJ Drama's record label Generation Now in 2018, an imprint of Atlantic Records. Harlow's first major breakthrough came with the release of his 2020 single, \"Whats Poppin\". Aided by its popularity on TikTok, and following a remix with rappers DaBaby, Tory Lanez, and Lil Wayne, it peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and went on to receive a Grammy Award nomination. Harlow was included on XXL magazine's \"2020 Freshman Class\" before he released his debut studio album, Thats What They All Say (2020), which was certified platinum in the US. In 2021, Harlow released a collaboration with Lil Nas X, \"Industry Baby\", which reached number one on the Hot 100, becoming Harlow's first chart-topper. Harlow released his second album Come Home the Kids Miss You in 2022, and its single, \"First Class\", became his second number-one on the Hot 100 and first to debut atop the chart. Harlow has received several award nominations from various institutions, including Top New Artist at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards. In the same year, he was named Varietyâ€™s \"Hitmaker of the Year\" and was included in Forbes 30 Under 30. In 2022, it was announced that Harlow will make his acting debut in a remake of the 1992 film White Men Can't Jump directed by Calmatic." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_Harlow> .

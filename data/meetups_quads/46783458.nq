<http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Gallo_(wrestler)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "El Gallo (born December 15, 1984 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico) is the ring name of a Mexican luchador enmascarado, or masked professional wrestler currently working for the Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) professional wrestling promotion. El Gallo is the son of luchador El LÃ­der and the brother of CMLL wrestler . He is a former three-time Occidente Light Heavyweight Champion and currently holds the Occidente Tag Team Championship with Esfinge. El Gallo's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. Originally he teamed up with his brother as \"Estrella de Jalisco I\", while his brother was known as \"Estrella de Jalisco II\", but changed his ring character to El Gallo in 2006. El Gallo is Spanish for \"The Rooster\", a name that is reflected in his mask, which is adorned by a Cockscomb and fabric wattles on his chin. In 2012 El Gallo began being accompanied to the ring by El Gallito (\"Little Rooster\") a Mini-Estrella mascota version of himself." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Gallo_(wrestler)> .

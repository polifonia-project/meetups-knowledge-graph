<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saeb_Salam> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Saeb Salam (17 January 1905 – 21 January 2000) (Arabic: صائب سلام) was a Lebanese politician, who served as Prime Minister six times between 1952 and 1973. Following his death, the Lebanese daily As-Safir described Salam as \"most successful in dealing with the media and in presenting a particular image of himself to people on a daily basis through wearing his customary carnation ... and expounding unforgettable slogans\", and that he was Lebanon's most popular prime minister after independence leader Riad Al Solh. A significant aspect of Salam was that, unlike other Lebanese leaders, he did not act as a chief over a particular area in the country. Salam fiercely advocated the unity of Lebanon." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saeb_Salam> .

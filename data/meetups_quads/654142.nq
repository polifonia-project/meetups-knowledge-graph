<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wade_Robson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wade Jeremy William Robson (born 17 September 1982) is an Australian dancer and choreographer. He began performing as a dancer at age five, and has directed music videos and world tours for pop acts such as NSYNC and Britney Spears. Robson was the host and executive producer of The Wade Robson Project, which aired on MTV in 2003. In 2007, he joined the Fox television dance series So You Think You Can Dance as a guest judge and choreographer. He won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for the dance number \"Ramalama (Bang Bang)\" of So You Think You Can Dance. When Robson was a child, he was befriended by the pop singer Michael Jackson. In 1993, when Jackson was first accused of child sexual abuse, Robson, aged 10, told police that nothing sexual had happened between them. In 2005, during Jackson's trial, Robson stated under oath that Jackson had never behaved inappropriately. In 2013, Robson reversed his position and filed a late creditor claim and a civil lawsuit against the Jackson estate, saying that Jackson had abused him from 1990 to 1997, when Robson was aged between seven and 14. He detailed his allegations in the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wade_Robson> .

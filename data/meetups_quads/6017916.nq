<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boss_Schmidt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles \"Boss\" Schmidt (September 12, 1880 â€“ November 14, 1932) was an American baseball catcher for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB) A native of Arkansas, Schmidt played professional baseball from 1901 to 1926, including six seasons in MLB with Detroit from 1906 to 1911. He was the starting catcher on the Detroit teams that won three consecutive American League pennants from 1907 to 1909. He also led the American League in errors by a catcher in each of those seasons. Schmidt had a reputation for toughness enhanced by his grotesque-looking hands, the result of work as a coal miner and prizefighter. Following his MLB career, Schmidt played Minor League Baseball for another 15 seasons. He then coached and managed ballclubs before dying suddenly of an intestinal obstruction in 1932." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boss_Schmidt> .

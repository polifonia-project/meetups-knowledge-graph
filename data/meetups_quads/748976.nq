<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernst_Heinrich_Weber> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ernst Heinrich Weber (24 June 1795 â€“ 26 January 1878) was a German physician who is considered one of the founders of experimental psychology. He was an influential and important figure in the areas of physiology and psychology during his lifetime and beyond. His studies on sensation and touch, along with his emphasis on good experimental techniques led to new directions and areas of study for future psychologists, physiologists, and anatomists. Ernst Weber was born into an academic background, with his father serving as a professor at the University of Wittenberg. Weber became a doctor, specializing in anatomy and physiology. Two of his younger brothers, Wilhelm and Eduard, were also influential in academia, both as scientists with one specializing in physics and the other in anatomy. Ernst became a lecturer and a professor at the University of Leipzig and stayed there until his retirement." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernst_Heinrich_Weber> .

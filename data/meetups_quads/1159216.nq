<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Prince> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Ferris Prince (July 1, 1916 â€“ June 10, 1985) was an American radio and television sportscaster and commentator, best known for his 28-year stint as the voice of the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball club, with whom he earned the nickname \"The Gunner\" and became a cultural icon in Pittsburgh. Prince was one of the most distinct and popular voices in sports broadcast history, known for his gravel voice, unabashed style and clever nicknames and phrases, which came to be known as \"Gunnerisms.\" His unique manner influenced a number of broadcasters after him, including Pittsburgh Penguins voice Mike Lange and Pittsburgh Steelers color analyst Myron Cope. Prince called Pirates games from 1948 to 1975, including the World Series championship years of 1960 and 1971. Nationally, he broadcast the 1960, 1966, and 1971 World Series and the 1965 All-Star Game for NBC, as well as the first year (1976) of ABC's Monday Night Baseball. He also broadcast at different times for other Pittsburgh-area sports teams, including Steelers football and Penguins hockey." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Prince> .

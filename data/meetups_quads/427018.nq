In 2004, a turning point happened in Kapoor's career when she played against type as a sex worker in the drama Chameli. She earned critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot victim in the 2004 drama Dev and a character based on William Shakespeare's heroine Desdemona in the 2006 crime film Omkara.

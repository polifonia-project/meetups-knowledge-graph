She is the oldest, most revered virgin martyr in the Normandy area of France but little is known of her. According to a tradition that exists in the diocese of Rouen, Honorina, a member of the Calates, was martyred during the persecutions of Diocletian. The spot of her martyrdom is said to have been Mélamare between Lillebonne and Harfleur. Her body was thrown into the Seine and would have drifted to , where it was collected by Christians and buried in a tomb. Another tradition holds that she was martyred at Coulonces. Other traditions place Honorina's martyrdom in the Pays d'Auge, where several villages bear her name." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honorina> .

Unnamed witnesses have claimed that her husband, Ghorban-Ali, a prison guard with a petty criminal past, was eager to get rid of her in order to marry a 14-year-old girl. Not wanting to support two families, nor return Soraya's dowry, he therefore spread false rumours of her adultery. Her death has been described as an event with \"a carnival atmosphere led by village elders\", and her death was painful and slow. After her death, the body remained outside so that animals could \"ravage\" it. Her death was the subject of a 1990 book, La Femme Lapidée, by Freidoune Sahebjam that was translated into English in 1994. The book was later adapted as the film The Stoning of Soraya M." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soraya_Manutchehri> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/JaMarcus_Russell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "JaMarcus Trenell Russell (born August 9, 1985) is a former American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for three seasons with the Oakland Raiders. Highly successful at LSU, where he was MVP of the 2007 Sugar Bowl, he was selected by the Raiders first overall in the 2007 NFL Draft. After being drafted by Oakland, Russell immediately incited conflict by engaging in a contract holdout until the second week of the 2007 season. His tenure with the Raiders would be defined by inconsistent play and questions over his work ethic, leading to his release in 2010. Due to not meeting the expectations of being the first pick and the extremely short length of his career for being a high draft pick, he is considered one of the NFL's biggest busts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/JaMarcus_Russell> .

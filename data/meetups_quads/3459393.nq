<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_di_Lorenzo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edward di Lorenzo is an American screenwriter. He also wrote for series Miami Vice and The Wild Wild West. Writing for the big screen, The Idolmaker (1980) has been his greatest commercial success so far, although some consider Lady Frankenstein (1971) an artistically greater achievement. Di Lorenzo contributed the scripts for \"Ring Around the Moon\", \"Missing Link\" and \"Alpha Child\" for Space: 1999 while also working as a script editor. His philosophical input for the series was also distilled into a novel White Light (1974), described by Johnny Byrne as a post-hippie version of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. He now teaches screenwriting at the University of Southern California." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_di_Lorenzo> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Sackville-West,_5th_Baron_Sackville> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edward Charles Sackville-West, 5th Baron Sackville (13 November 1901 â€“ 4 July 1965) was a British music critic, novelist and, in his last years, a member of the House of Lords. Musically gifted as a boy, he was attracted as a young man to a literary life and wrote a series of semi-autobiographical novels in the 1920s and 1930s. They made little impact, and his more lasting books are a biography of the essayist Thomas De Quincey and The Record Guide, Britain's first comprehensive guide to classical music on record, first published in 1951. As a critic and a member of the board of the Royal Opera House, he strove to promote the works of young British composers, including Benjamin Britten and Michael Tippett. Britten worked with him on a musical drama for radio and dedicated to him one of his best known works, the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Sackville-West,_5th_Baron_Sackville> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_Kell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Reginald Clifford Kell (8 June 1906 â€“ 5 August 1981) was an English clarinettist. He was noted especially for his career as a soloist and chamber music player. He was the principal clarinettist in leading British orchestras, including the London Philharmonic, Philharmonia, and Royal Philharmonic, and was also active as a solo recording artist. Kell was influential as one of the first clarinettists to employ continuous vibrato to enhance the expressive quality of the instrument. He was also a noted teacher, serving two different appointments at his alma mater, the Royal Academy of Music in London. In 1948 Kell moved to the United States where he pursued a solo career and taught, with pupils including the jazz clarinettist Benny Goodman." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_Kell> .

Both companies are known for detailed and realistic mathematical models of complex physical systems. Amels also plays organ in The Reigning Sound, a garage rock band out of Asheville, North Carolina. Despite being an inventor of influential digital products, Dave, a garage rock fan and WFMU radio DJ, is famous for only using analog methods of recording. He designed recording studios and custom analog electronics for high end studios. As a musician and record producer, Amels has worked with Ben E. King, Lenny Kravitz, Mary Weiss of 1960s girl group The Shangri-Las, and Dennis Diken of The Smithereens. In 2002, Amels collaborated with Dennis Diken to form the band Husky Team. They released the album Christmas in Memphis on the Confidential Recording label. Dave Amels relaunched the Cryptovision Records record label in 2009. Amels worked in A&R for the label in the 1980s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dave_Amels> .

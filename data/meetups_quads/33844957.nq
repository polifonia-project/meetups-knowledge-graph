He was the first president of the International Matrix Group (1987-1990) and its successor, the International Linear Algebra Society (1990 – 1996), which established the triennial Hans Schneider Prize in 1993. Schneider was a founding editor (1968-1972) and then editor-in-chief of Linear Algebra and Its Applications (1972 - 2012) and an Advisory Editor of the Electronic Journal of Linear Algebra. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1952; his advisor was Alexander Craig Aitken. Following his doctorate, he taught at the Queen's University of Belfast until 1959, when he moved to the University of Wisconsin. He retired in 1993. He was the author of over 160 research papers.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Holmes_(actor)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Curtis Holmes (né Estes; August 8, 1944 – March 13, 1988), better known as John C. Holmes or Johnny Wadd (after the lead character he portrayed in a series of related films), was an American pornographic film actor. He ranks among the most prolific adult film performers, with documented credits for at least 573 films. Holmes was best known for his exceptionally large penis, which was heavily promoted for its length and thickness. However no documented measurement of Holmes' actual penis length, girth, tumescence, sexual stamina, or ejaculate volume has ever been confirmed. Near the end of his life, Holmes attained notoriety for his reputed involvement in the Wonderland murders of July 1981 and eventually for his death from complications caused by AIDS in March 1988. He was the subject of several books, a lengthy essay in Rolling Stone and two feature-length documentaries, and was the inspiration for two Hollywood movies (Boogie Nights and Wonderland)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Holmes_(actor)> .

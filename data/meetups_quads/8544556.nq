<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gurbanguly_Berdimuhamedow> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gurbanguly Mälikgulyýewiç Berdimuhamedow (born 29 June 1957), also known as Arkadag (Cyrillic: Аркадаг, \"protector\"), is a Turkmen politician who served as the second president of Turkmenistan from 2006 to 2022. A dentist by profession, Berdimuhamedow served in the government of president Saparmurat Niyazov as the minister of health in 1997 and as the vice president in 2001. He became acting president following Niyazov's death on 21 December 2006 and subsequently won the 2007 presidential election. He faced no meaningful opposition and won by an overwhelming margin with 89% of the vote. In 2012, he was re-elected for a second term with 97% of the vote and he was re-elected again in 2017 with 97.7% of the vote. He was among the candidates elected to the People's Council of Turkmenistan (Turkmen: Halk Maslahaty) on 28 March 2021, as a member from Ahal Region. He reportedly received 100% of votes from the electors. On 14 April 2021, he was unanimously elected chairman of the People's Council, the upper chamber of the Turkmen parliament. Like his predecessor, Berdimuhamedow headed an authoritarian regime in which he was the subject of a cult of personality. Rights groups have described Turkmenistan under Berdimuhamedow as one of the most repressive countries in the world, accusing Berdimuhamedow, his relatives, and his associates of possessing and exercising unlimited power over all aspects of public life. Berdimuhamedow stepped down as president on 19 March 2022, being succeeded by his son, Serdar, who won a snap election deemed as neither free nor fair." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gurbanguly_Berdimuhamedow> .

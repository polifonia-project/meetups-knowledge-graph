<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vijaya_Bhaskar> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vijaya Bhaskar (Kannada: ವಿಜಯಭಾಸ್ಕರ್; 1924–2002) was an Indian music director and composer who composed music for several mainstream and experimental feature films in the Kannada film industry. Scoring music for over 600 feature films, Bhaskar worked in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi, Tulu and Konkani language films as well. He was a part of all of popular Kannada film director KSL Swamy's (Ravi) movies and was also known for his association with acclaimed directors Puttanna Kanagal and Adoor Gopalakrishnan. Influenced by R C Boral and Mukul Mehta, Bhaskar developed his own style of music and introduced the concept of theme music in Kannada film industry. He is credited for inspiring producers to select popular works of Kannada poets through his music. He was awarded with the Dr. Rajkumar Award and the prestigious Sur Singar Award from Mumbai music lovers (for his classical score in Malaya Marutha Kannada movie, directed by Ravi). He was also a recipient of Karnataka State Film Award for Best Music Director six times. Some of Bhaskar's most popular soundtracks include Rani Honnamma, Santha Thukaram, Gejje Pooje, Mana Mechida Madadi, Belli Moda, Naandi, Sharapanjara, Naagarahaavu, Shubhamangala, Neela and Malaya Marutha. Vijaya Bhaskar never got a chance to get Rajkumar to sing in his music direction (except for humming a few lines of Doniyolage Neenu in Uyyale), though the movie Santha Thukaram in their combination had won National award. But Rajkumar went on to sing in Vijaya Bhaskar's daughter's function." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vijaya_Bhaskar> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Douglas_(artist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Aaron Douglas (May 26, 1899 â€“ February 2, 1979) was an American painter, illustrator and visual arts educator. He was a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. He developed his art career painting murals and creating illustrations that addressed social issues around race and segregation in the United States by utilizing African-centric imagery. Douglas set the stage for young, African-American artists to enter the public-arts realm through his involvement with the Harlem Artists Guild. In 1944, he concluded his art career by founding the Art Department at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He taught visual art classes at Fisk until his retirement in 1966. Douglas is known as a prominent leader in modern African-American art whose work influenced artists for years to come." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Douglas_(artist)> .

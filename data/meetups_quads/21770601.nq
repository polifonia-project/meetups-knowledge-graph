He founded the department of anthropology at Rutgers University in 1967 and had remained a professor there for the rest of his career, also being a director of research for the H. F. Guggenheim Foundation from 1972 to 1984. Fox published The Imperial Animal, with Lionel Tiger in 1971 one of the earliest to advocate and demonstrate an evolutionary approach to the understanding of human social behaviour. His daughter Kate Fox wrote the book Watching the English. In 2013 Fox was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences (Anthropology and Evolutionary Biology)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Fox> .

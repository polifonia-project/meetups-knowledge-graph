<http://dbpedia.org/resource/C._L._Max_Nikias> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chrysostomos Loizos \"Max\" Nikias (Greek: Χρυσόστομος Λοΐζος Νικίας; born September 30, 1952) is a Cypriot-American academic, and served as the 11th University of Southern California president, a position he held from August 3, 2010, to August 7, 2018. He holds the Malcolm R. Currie Chair in Technology and the Humanities and is president emeritus of the university. He had been at USC since 1991, as a professor, director of national research centers, dean, provost, and president. He also served as chair of the College Football Playoff (CFP) Board of Managers (2015-2018) as chair of the board of the Keck Medical Center at USC (2009-2018), as member of the board of directors of the Alfred Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering (2001-2018), and as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Chadwick School, an independent school in Palos Verdes Peninsula, Calif. (2001-2010). He is currently a tenured professor in electrical engineering with a secondary appointment in classics, and the director of the USC Institute for Technology Enabled Higher Education. In May 2018, 200 tenured USC professors (out of about 1,181 tenured faculty) demanded Nikias's resignation for how his administration dealt with nearly 300 incidents of sexual assault and sexual misconduct allegations over 27 years against a longtime student health center gynecologist, George Tyndall. He and the board of trustees agreed to an orderly transition to a new president on May 25, 2018, and he stepped down on August 7, 2018. Following this, Nikias was named president emeritus and a life trustee of the university. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Right's independent investigation concluded with a report published in February 2020 and did not implicate Nikias in any specific wrongdoing. The report also states that it \"determines that the University violated the Title IX regulation at 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.8(b) and 106.31 because the University failed to promptly and effectively respond to notice of potential sexual harassment by Employee 1 and this failure may have allowed female students to be subjected to continuing sex discrimination.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/C._L._Max_Nikias> .

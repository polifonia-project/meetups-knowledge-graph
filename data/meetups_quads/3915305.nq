<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmie_Fidler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jimmie Fidler (August 26, 1898 â€“ August 9, 1988) was an American columnist, journalist and radio and television personality. He wrote a Hollywood gossip column and was sometimes billed as Jimmy Fidler. Born James Marion Fidler in St. Louis, Missouri, Fidler was a Hollywood publicist and advertising man who became a highly successful syndicated columnist with his \"Jimmie Fidler in Hollywood\" column in 187 outlets, including the New York Post and the Los Angeles Times. In 1933-34 his 15-minute NBC radio show, Hollywood on the Air, sponsored by Tangee lipstick, was broadcast from the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. He was regarded in Hollywood as a genuine threat to gossip queen Louella Parsons, especially after he scooped her in November 1935 on a major story about Clark Gable, an incident so embarrassing to Parsons that she lied about it in her autobiography." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmie_Fidler> .

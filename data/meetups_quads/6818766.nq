A representative from Austin County, Crump was a novice in political circles, having held no previous public office in Texas either in the Republic or at the local level. Despite his lack of experience, he was elected Speaker on the first ballot without any substantial opposition." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Crump_(Texas_politician)> .

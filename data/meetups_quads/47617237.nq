Sandvold spent most of his career as the cathedral organist and cantor at Oslo Cathedral and as an organ teacher at the Oslo Conservatory of Music, now the Norwegian Academy of Music, for more than 50 years. Sandvold was the director of the choir (Norwegian: Cæciliaforeningen) from 1928 to 1957. Sandvold studied for several years in Oslo under and Gustav Fredrik Lange, among others, before he traveled to Leipzig, where he studied organ playing under Karl Straube. In Leipzig Sandvold, heard Max Reger's organ music and this had a major influence on him. This influence is most clearly reflected in his major organ work Introduction and Passacaglia in B Minor." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arild_Sandvold> .

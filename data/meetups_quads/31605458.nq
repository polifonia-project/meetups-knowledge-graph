Then, in 1996, Tadeo became one of the original \"Sketchistosos\" on the comedy/variety series with Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo. One recurring sketch on the series was set in a classroom; Sheyla's character was named Zoila. Because of the success of the classroom sketches, Tadeo was invited to reprise her role when those sketches became a separate television series in 1998 as . On the series, as on the sketches before it, Zoila is an overweight elementary school student who is usually seen bringing a sandwich to class. In 2000 she was cast in the telenovela Mi destino eres tu; this eventually led Tadeo to leave Cero en conducta, although she would reprise her role of Zoila in 2004 for , the successor to Cero en conducta. By then, she had portrayed a maid in another comedy series, La Jaula, and had married Javier Padilla (in 2003).

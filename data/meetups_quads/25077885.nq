<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wendy_Mulford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wendy Mulford (born 1941) is a Welsh-born poet, associated with the contemporary avant garde scene, with the British Poetry Revival, and with the development of feminist poetry in the 1970s. Her poetry has been viewed as \"difficult to categorise\" and as \"multi- and non-linear\". Her early poetry had particularly strong feminist and Marxist elements, but latterly she has moved towards more personal themes. Mulford's prose works include a combined biography of Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland, a book about female saints, and essays about poetry. In 2007, she started studying for a new career as a Jungian analyst." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wendy_Mulford> .

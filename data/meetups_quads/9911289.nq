As a pop singer, he had a Top 40 hit on the Go-Set singles chart with a cover version of The Shirelles' 1961 hit, \"Baby It's You\". At the Logie Awards of 1970, he won the Best New Talent category for hosting his own ABC-TV pop show, Sounds Like Us. In the early 1970s he hosted a series of teen pop music shows, Happening '71 and Happening '72. In July 1972 Phillips won a song prize at the Fifth Olympiad of Song, held in Athens, performing his self-written work, \"Gloria\"; the prize money was 100,000 drachmae (AUD $2,797). Although he issued further singles, until the early 1980s, he had no other national Top 40 chart success. From July 1985 to October 1987 he appeared in the Australian stage production of Cats in the role of Rum Tum Tugger in both the Sydney run and the Melbourne season; he also performed on the original Australian cast album." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Phillips_(singer)> .

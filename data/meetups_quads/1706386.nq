<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Cherney> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brian Cherney CM (born 1942) is a Canadian composer currently residing in Montreal, Quebec. Cherney was born in Peterborough, Ontario. He studied at the University of Toronto where he was a pupil of John Weinzweig, Samuel Dolin, and John Beckwith. In 1972 he joined Schulich School of Music of McGill University, where he has taught analysis and composition for over thirty years. His pieces, often characterized by carefully calculated formal trajectories and a rich harmonic language, give the impression of a quiet intensity, usually featuring \"stillness\" in some manner. His works have been played throughout North America, Europe, and elsewhere. Cherney maintains an active career as a composer, teacher and author; his book Harry Somers (1975, U of T Press) remains one of the most important and detailed works of reference on this composer. He was awarded the Jules LÃ©ger Prize for New Chamber Music in 1985 for River of Fire. He is the brother of oboist Lawrence Cherney. Cherney was made a member of the Order of Canada in 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Cherney> .

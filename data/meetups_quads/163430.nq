<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Profumo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Dennis Profumo, CBE,(/prəˈfjuːmoʊ/ prə-FEW-moh; 30 January 1915 – 9 March 2006) was a British politician whose career ended in 1963 after a sexual relationship with the 19-year-old model Christine Keeler in 1961. The scandal, which became known as the Profumo affair, led to his resignation from the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan. After his resignation Profumo worked as a volunteer at Toynbee Hall, a charity in East London, and became its chief fundraiser. These charitable activities helped to restore his reputation and he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1975." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Profumo> .

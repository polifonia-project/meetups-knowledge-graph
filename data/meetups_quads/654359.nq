She is best known as a member of the pop-rock band The Corrs, which she co-founded in 1990 with her elder brother Jim and younger sisters Caroline and Andrea. She plays the violin, piano and guitar, and sings backing vocals. She began learning the violin when she was six years old.

On 22 March 2019, Corr was awarded an honorary doctorate (DUniv) by the Open University, in recognition of her \"exceptional contribution to education and culture\".

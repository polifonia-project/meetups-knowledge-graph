Young was the first African-American mayor of Detroit. Young had emerged from the far-left element in Detroit, and moderated somewhat after his election as mayor. He called an ideological truce and gained widespread support from the city's business leaders. The new mayor was energetic in the construction of the Joe Louis Arena, and upgrading the city's mass transit system. He assisted General Motors in building its new \"Poletown\" plant at the site of the former Dodge Main plant in Hamtramck. Some opponents said that he pulled money out of the neighborhoods to rehabilitate the downtown business district, but he said \"there were no other options.\" In 1981, Young received the Spingarn Medal for achievement from the NAACP." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coleman_Young> .

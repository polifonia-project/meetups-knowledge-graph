He worked for a time as a radio announcer with VOCM, but, following his 1951 marriage to Marjorie Halley, joined , a dry goods wholesale and retail firm. Following the death of his father-in-law, Patrick Halley, in 1956, Murphy became president of the company and expanded its retail chain, , to nine stores in the St. John's and Conception Bay South region. As of 1990, only two of the stores were still operating. Murphy ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in the 1966 provincial election and again in a by-election in 1970. Elected to St. John's City council in 1973, he became deputy mayor. In 1977, he ran unsuccessfully against incumbent mayor Dorothy Wyatt, but defeated her in 1981. He won by acclamation in 1985, did not run in the 1990 election, but was elected for again in 1993, and retired from city politics in 1997 after losing his bid for re-election as Mayor. During his tenure on council Murphy was successful in restoring downtown residential properties by lobbying federal and provincial governments for home improvement funds.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Dudley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Dudley (May 12, 1910 â€“ June 1, 2004) was an American baseball player, professional wrestling manager, and professional wrestling executive. He played Negro league baseball for nine years but is best known for his time with the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Dudley was the first African-American to run a major United States arena (Turner's Arena in Washington, D.C.). He worked with four generations of wrestling's McMahon family and was particularly close with Vincent J. McMahon. At age 74, he was put back on the company's payroll to show appreciation for his work for the McMahons. He also managed several wrestlers in the WWWF and was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Dudley> .

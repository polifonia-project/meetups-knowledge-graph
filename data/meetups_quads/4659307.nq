<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sadhana_Shivdasani> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sadhana Shivdasani (2 September 1941 – 25 December 2015), known mononymously as Sadhana, was an Indian actress active between 1960 and 1981. Popularly known as \"The Mystery Girl\" for playing mysterious women in films directed by Raj Khosla, Shivdasani ranked among the highest-paid actresses in the country from mid-1960s to early 1970s. Born in Karachi, Shivdasani and her family migrated to Bombay during the partition of India when she was 7 years old. She aspired to become an actress since her childhood, and completed her education from Jai Hind College. After making an unnoticed appearance in Shree 420 (1955), Shivdasani became the protègè of the director Sashadhar Mukherjee, who enrolled her in his acting school and then provided her with her first starring role, in the romantic comedy Love In Simla (1960), where her distinctive hairstyle became a rage and came to be known as \"Sadhana Cut\". Following the success of Love In Simla, Shivdasini went on to establish herself with several hits, including the comedies Parakh (1960) and Asli-Naqli (1962), the war film Hum Dono (1961) and the adventurous Ek Musafir Ek Haseena (1962). Shivdasini followed this initial success with her greatest commercial successes—the romances Mere Mehboob (1963), Rajkumar (1964) and Arzoo (1965); the mystery dramas Woh Kaun Thi? (1964) and Mera Saaya (1966); and the drama Waqt (1965); she earned Filmfare nominations for her performances in Woh Kaun Thi and Waqt. Her health deteriorated in latter half of 1960s due to hyperthyroidism, which forced her to take a brief break from work. Shivdasini returned to acting in 1969 and starred in two consecutive box-office hits—Ek Phool Do Maali and Intaqam—but her subsequent films were unpopular with audience. In 1974, the actress made her directorial debut with the crime thriller Geetaa Mera Naam, and later withdrew from acting. Her final screen appearance was in the delayed release Ulfat Ki Nayee Manzeelein (1994). In 2002, she received the IIFA Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions to Indian cinema. Shivdasini was married to Love in Simla director R.K. Nayyar in 1966. Their marriage lasted for 30 years and ended when Nayyar died in 1995. Shivdasini never remarried after his death and lived alone for most of her life. Her health had begun to decline after her diagnosis with thyroid disease in 1966. She was diagnosed with brain tumor that led her to her ultimate death at 74 on 25 December 2015 in her flat at Mumbai." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sadhana_Shivdasani> .

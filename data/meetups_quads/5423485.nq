<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krista_Vernoff> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Krista Vernoff (born October 25, 1971) is an American television screenwriter, executive producer and director. She is best known for running the television medical drama Grey's Anatomy (2007–11, 2017–present) and its spin-off Station 19 (2019–present). She has also served as executive producer and writer for the US version of Shameless. Other works as producer-writer for television include Charmed and Wonderfalls. Vernoff earned three Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Grey's Anatomy; two as a producer for the show's Best Drama Series nominations in 2006 and 2007 which were won and one personal Emmy nomination in 2006 for Best Drama Writing for her episode “Into You Like a Train”, an episode that was highly acclaimed years after its initial airing and hailed as the show's best single episode by The A.V. Club. In 2017, Shonda Rhimes enlisted Vernoff to return to Grey's for its fourteenth season with complete creative control, after she signed a deal to leave ABC for Netflix and Stacy McKee, the previous showrunner, left to run its spin-off Station 19. Vernoff became showrunner for Station 19 after McKee's departure in 2019. That same year she signed a multiyear overall deal with ABC Studios to produce new projects for ABC under her production company, Trip the Light Productions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krista_Vernoff> .

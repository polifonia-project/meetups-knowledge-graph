<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Sylvester_I> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pope Sylvester I (also Silvester, 285 â€“ 31 December 335) was the bishop of Rome from 31 January 314 until his death. He filled the see of Rome at an important era in the history of the Western Church, yet very little is known of him. The accounts of his pontificate preserved in the seventh- or eighth-century Liber Pontificalis contain little more than a record of the gifts said to have been conferred on the church by Constantine I, although it does say that he was the son of a Roman named Rufinus. His feast is celebrated as Saint Sylvester's Day, on 31 December in Western Christianity, and on 2 January in Eastern Christianity." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Sylvester_I> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebecca_Schaeffer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rebecca Lucile Schaeffer (November 6, 1967 – July 18, 1989) was an American actress and model. She began her career as a teen model before moving on to acting. In 1986, she landed the role of Patricia \"Patti\" Russell in the CBS comedy My Sister Sam. The series was canceled in 1988, and she appeared in several films, including the black comedy Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills. At the age of 21, she was shot and killed by Robert John Bardo, a 19-year-old obsessed fan who had been stalking her. Schaeffer’s death helped lead to the passage in California of legislation aimed at preventing stalking." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebecca_Schaeffer> .

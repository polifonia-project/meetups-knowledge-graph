<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Chapman_(baseball)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Benjamin Chapman (December 25, 1908 â€“ July 7, 1993) was an American outfielder and manager in Major League Baseball who played for several teams. He began his career with the New York Yankees, playing his first seven seasons there. During the period from 1926 to 1943, Chapman had more stolen bases than any other player, leading the American League four times. After 12 seasons, during which he batted .302 and led the AL in assists and double plays twice each, he spent two years in the minor leagues and returned to the majors as a National League pitcher for three seasons, becoming player-manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, his final team. Chapman's playing reputation was eclipsed by the role he played in 1947 as manager of the Phillies, antagonizing Jackie Robinson by shouting racist epithets and opposing his presence on a major league team on the basis of Robinson's race with unsportsmanlike conduct that was an embarrassment for his team. He was fired the following season and never managed in the majors again." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Chapman_(baseball)> .

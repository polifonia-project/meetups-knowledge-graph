<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Mitchell_(organist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Mitchell (October 12, 1912 â€“ July 4, 2009) was an American organist and choir director whose career spanned 85 years, from 1924 to 2009. He was one of the last original silent film accompanists, having accompanied films from 1924 to 1928. Mitchell revived the art from 1992 until his death in 2009, usually to wild acclaim. During the 1930s, he organized the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir, who were cast in many films from the 1930s to the 1960s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Mitchell_(organist)> .

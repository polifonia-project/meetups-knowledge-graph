<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Havergal_Brian> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Havergal Brian (born William Brian; 29 January 1876 â€“ 28 November 1972) was an English composer. He is best known for having composed 32 symphonies (an unusually high total for a 20th-century composer), most of them late in his life. His best-known work is his Symphony No. 1, The Gothic, which calls for some of the largest orchestral forces demanded by a conventionally structured concert work. He also composed five operas and a number of other orchestral works, as well as songs, choral music and a small amount of chamber music. Brian enjoyed a period of popularity earlier in his career and rediscovery in the 1950s, but public performances of his music have remained rare and he has been described as a cult composer. He continued to be extremely productive late into his career, composing large works even into his nineties, most of which remained unperformed during his lifetime." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Havergal_Brian> .

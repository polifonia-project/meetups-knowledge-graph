<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darren_Aronofsky> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Darren Aronofsky (born February 12, 1969) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. His films are noted for their surrealistic, melodramatic, and sometimes disturbing elements, often in the form of psychological fiction. Aronofsky attended Harvard University, where he studied film and social anthropology, and then the American Film Institute where he studied directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, which became a National Student Academy Award finalist. In 1997, he founded the film and TV production company Protozoa Pictures. His feature debut, the surrealist psychological thriller Pi (1998), was produced for $60,000 and grossed over $3 million; It won Aronofsky the Directing Award at the Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay. Aronofsky's follow-up, the psychological drama Requiem for a Dream (2000), was based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. After writing the World War II horror film Below (2002), Aronofsky began production on his third film, the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama The Fountain (2006). The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following. His fourth film, the sports drama The Wrestler (2008), was released to critical acclaim and both of the film's stars, Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei, received Academy Award nominations. His next film, the psychological horror film Black Swan (2010), received further critical acclaim and many accolades, with five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and a Best Actress win for Natalie Portman. Aronofsky's sixth feature film, the biblicallyâ€“inspired epic Noah (2014), became his first film to open at No. 1 at the box office despite its mixed reception from critics and audiences. His seventh film, the psychological horror mother! (2017), sparked controversy upon release due to its graphic and disturbing content, polarizing both critics and audiences." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darren_Aronofsky> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Southey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Southey (/ˈsaʊði/ or /ˈsʌði/; 12 August 1774 – 21 March 1843) was an English poet of the Romantic school, and Poet laureate from 1813 until his death. Like the other Lake Poets, William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Southey began as a radical but became steadily more conservative as he gained respect for Britain and its institutions. Other romantics such as Byron accused him of siding with the establishment for money and status. He is remembered especially for the poem \"After Blenheim\" and the original version of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Southey> .

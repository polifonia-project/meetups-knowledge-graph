<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anne_Clark_(poet)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anne Charlotte Clark (born 14 May 1960) is an English poet, singer and songwriter. Her first album, The Sitting Room, was released in 1982, and she has released over a dozen albums since then. Her poetry work with experimental musicians occupies a region bounded roughly by electronic, dance (techno applies on occasion) and possibly avant-garde genres, with varying hard as well as romantic and orchestral styles. Clark is mainly a spoken word artist. Many of her lyrics deal critically with the imperfections of humanity, everyday life, and politics. Especially in her early works she has created a gloomy, melancholy kind of atmosphere bordering on weltschmerz. She has been considered one of the pioneers in the spoken-word music genre, as well as being highly idolised over the board of techno-pop and new wave music, especially across Europe." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anne_Clark_(poet)> .

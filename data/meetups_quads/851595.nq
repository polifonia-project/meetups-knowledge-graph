<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ibn_Khaldun> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ibn Khaldun (/ˈɪbən xælˈduːn/; Arabic: أبو زيد عبد الرحمن بن محمد بن خلدون الحضرمي, Abū Zayd ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad ibn Khaldūn al-Ḥaḍramī; 27 May 1332 – 17 March 1406, 732-808 AH) was an Arab sociologist, philosopher, and historian widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest social scientists of the Middle Ages, who made major contributions in the areas of historiography, sociology, economics, and demography. His best-known book, the Muqaddimah or Prolegomena (\"Introduction\"), which he wrote in six months as he states in his autobiography, influenced 17th-century and 19th-century Ottoman historians such as Kâtip Çelebi, Mustafa Naima and Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, who used its theories to analyze the growth and decline of the Ottoman Empire. Ibn Khaldun interacted with Tamerlane, the founder of the Timurid Empire. Recently, Ibn Khaldun's works have been compared with those of influential European philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Giambattista Vico, David Hume, G. W. F. Hegel, Karl Marx, and Auguste Comte as well as the economists David Ricardo and Adam Smith, suggesting that their ideas found precedent (although not direct influence) in his. He has also been influential on certain modern Islamic thinkers (e.g. those of the traditionalist school), as well as on Reaganomics." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar> .

Bliss's musical training was cut short by the First World War, in which he served with distinction in the army. In the post-war years he quickly became known as an unconventional and modernist composer, but within the decade he began to display a more traditional and romantic side in his music. In the 1920s and 1930s he composed extensively not only for the concert hall, but also for films and ballet. In the Second World War, Bliss returned to England from the US to work for the BBC and became its director of music. After the war he resumed his work as a composer, and was appointed Master of the Queen's Music. In Bliss's later years, his work was respected but was thought old-fashioned, and it was eclipsed by the music of younger colleagues such as William Walton and Benjamin Britten. Since his death, his compositions have been well represented in recordings, and many of his better-known works remain in the repertoire of British orchestras." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar> .

He founded Ananda Marga (the Path of Bliss) in 1955 as a spiritual and social organisation that continues to offer instruction in meditation and yoga. and runs numerous social service and disaster relief projects throughout the world. Sarkar developed his system of spiritual practice as a synthesis of Vedic and Tantric philosophies. He denounced religious dogmas, casteism, materialism and capitalism, considering all of these as impediments to social harmony, progress and spiritual growth. He described the universe as a manifestation of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature, resulting in creation. His spiritual and social philosophies embraced diversity as the law of nature; a result of Singular Consciousness expressing itself in numerous forms. Sarkar advocated for the welfare of humans and the planet through his socio-economic philosophy of Prout, which is rooted in the idea of Neohumanism, a worldview based on inter-connectedness of all beings." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sadhana_Shivdasani> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sadhana Shivdasani (2 September 1941 – 25 December 2015), known mononymously as Sadhana, was an Indian actress active between 1960 and 1981. Popularly known as \"The Mystery Girl\" for playing mysterious women in films directed by Raj Khosla, Shivdasani ranked among the highest-paid actresses in the country from mid-1960s to early 1970s. Born in Karachi, Shivdasani and her family migrated to Bombay during the partition of India when she was 7 years old. She aspired to become an actress since her childhood, and completed her education from Jai Hind College. After making an unnoticed appearance in Shree 420 (1955), Shivdasani became the protègè of the director Sashadhar Mukherjee, who enrolled her in his acting school and then provided her with her first starring role, in the romantic comedy Love In Simla (1960), where her distinctive hairstyle became a rage and came to be known as \"Sadhana Cut\". Following the success of Love In Simla, Shivdasini went on to establish herself with several hits, including the comedies Parakh (1960) and Asli-Naqli (1962), the war film Hum Dono (1961) and the adventurous Ek Musafir Ek Haseena (1962). Shivdasini followed this initial success with her greatest commercial successes—the romances Mere Mehboob (1963), Rajkumar (1964) and Arzoo (1965); the mystery dramas Woh Kaun Thi? (1964) and Mera Saaya (1966); and the drama Waqt (1965); she earned Filmfare nominations for her performances in Woh Kaun Thi and Waqt. Her health deteriorated in latter half of 1960s due to hyperthyroidism, which forced her to take a brief break from work. Shivdasini returned to acting in 1969 and starred in two consecutive box-office hits—Ek Phool Do Maali and Intaqam—but her subsequent films were unpopular with audience. In 1974, the actress made her directorial debut with the crime thriller Geetaa Mera Naam, and later withdrew from acting. Her final screen appearance was in the delayed release Ulfat Ki Nayee Manzeelein (1994). In 2002, she received the IIFA Lifetime Achievement Award for her contributions to Indian cinema. Shivdasini was married to Love in Simla director R.K. Nayyar in 1966. Their marriage lasted for 30 years and ended when Nayyar died in 1995. Shivdasini never remarried after his death and lived alone for most of her life. Her health had begun to decline after her diagnosis with thyroid disease in 1966. She was diagnosed with brain tumor that led her to her ultimate death at 74 on 25 December 2015 in her flat at Mumbai." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar> .

He was also a journalist, editing newspapers such as Vande Mataram. He joined the Indian movement for independence from British colonial rule, until 1910 was one of its influential leaders, and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and spiritual evolution. Aurobindo studied for the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the Maharaja of the Princely state of Baroda and became increasingly involved in nationalist politics in the Indian National Congress and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal with the Anushilan Samiti. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bombings linked to his organization in a public trial where he faced charges of treason for Alipore Conspiracy. However, Sri Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British colonial rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness, Narendranath Goswami, during the trial. During his stay in the jail, he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work. At Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a spiritual practice he called Integral Yoga. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a divine life in divine body. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated but transformed human nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (referred to as \"The Mother\"), Sri Aurobindo Ashram was founded. His main literary works are The Life Divine, which deals with the philosophical aspect of Integral Yoga; Synthesis of Yoga, which deals with the principles and methods of Integral Yoga; and Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol, an epic poem." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_Foucault> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul-Michel Foucault (UK: /ˈfuːkoʊ/, US: /fuːˈkoʊ/; French: [pɔl miʃɛl fuko]; 15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984) was a French philosopher, historian of ideas, writer, political activist, and literary critic. Foucault's theories primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge, and how they are used as a form of social control through societal institutions. Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels. His thought has influenced academics, especially those working in communication studies, anthropology, psychology, sociology, criminology, cultural studies, literary theory, feminism, Marxism and critical theory. Born in Poitiers, France, into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the Lycée Henri-IV, at the École Normale Supérieure, where he developed an interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology. After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, The History of Madness (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced The Birth of the Clinic (1963) and The Order of Things (1966), publications that displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology.\" From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University of Tunis before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris VIII. Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Collège de France, a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in several left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society. Foucault died in Paris from complications of HIV/AIDS; he became the first public figure in France to die from complications of the disease. His partner Daniel Defert founded the AIDES charity in his memory." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prabhat_Ranjan_Sarkar> .

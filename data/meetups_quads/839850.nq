<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roderic> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Roderic (also spelled Ruderic, Roderik, Roderich, or Roderick; Spanish and Portuguese: Rodrigo, Arabic: لذريق, romanized: Ludharīq; died 711) was the Visigothic king in Hispania between 710 and 711. He is well-known as \"the last king of the Goths\". He is actually an extremely obscure figure about whom little can be said with certainty. He was the last Goth to rule from Toledo, but not the last Gothic king, a distinction which belongs to Ardo. Roderic's election as king was disputed and he ruled only a part of Hispania with an opponent, Achila, ruling the rest. He faced a rebellion of the Basques and the Umayyad invasion. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Guadalete. His widow Egilona is believed to have married Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, the first Muslim governor of Hispania." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roderic> .

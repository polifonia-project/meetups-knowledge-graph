<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_Rubbra> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edmund Rubbra (/ˈrʌbrə/; 23 May 1901 – 14 February 1986) was a British composer. He composed both instrumental and vocal works for soloists, chamber groups and full choruses and orchestras. He was greatly esteemed by fellow musicians and was at the peak of his fame in the mid-20th century. The most famous of his pieces are his eleven symphonies. Although he was active at a time when many people wrote twelve-tone music, he decided not to write in this idiom himself. Instead he devised his own distinctive style. His later works were not as popular with the concert-going public as his previous ones had been, although he never lost the respect of his colleagues. Therefore, his output as a whole is less celebrated today than would have been expected from its early popularity. He was the brother of the engineer Arthur Rubbra." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_Rubbra> .

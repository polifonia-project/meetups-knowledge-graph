<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douglas_Stewart_(poet)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Douglas Stewart AO OBE (6 May 1913 â€“ 14 February 1985) was a major twentieth century Australian poet, as well as short story writer, essayist and literary editor. He published 13 collections of poetry, 5 verse plays, including the well-known Fire on the Snow, many short stories and critical essays, and biographies of Norman Lindsay and Kenneth Slessor. He also edited several poetry anthologies. His greatest contribution to Australian literature came from his 20 years as literary editor of The Bulletin, his 10 years as a publishing editor with Angus & Robertson, and his lifetime support of Australian writers. Geoffrey Serle, literary critic, has described Stewart as \"the greatest all-rounder of modern Australian literature\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douglas_Stewart_(poet)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_of_Ockham> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William of Ockham, OFM (/ˈɒkəm/; also Occam, from Latin: Gulielmus Occamus; c. 1287 – 10 April 1347) was an English Franciscan friar, scholastic philosopher, apologist, and Catholic theologian, who is believed to have been born in Ockham, a small village in Surrey. He is considered to be one of the major figures of medieval thought and was at the centre of the major intellectual and political controversies of the 14th century. He is commonly known for Occam's razor, the methodological principle that bears his name, and also produced significant works on logic, physics and theology. William is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 10 April." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_of_Ockham> .

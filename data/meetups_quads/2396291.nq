Tommy is most known for his first long-running morning show \"The Rock and Roll Breakfast\" with co-host David \"Big Dave\" Medford at Magic 105 (105.1 FM), as well as his second long-running morning show \"The Show With No Name\" with co-hosts Roger Scott and David Bazzel on KABZ 103.7 The Buzz. Smith is a 1972 graduate of Little Rock Central High School, and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. After announcing his impending retirement shortly after the 2021 new year, Tommy decided that Dec 31st would be his final show. After he retired, country music superstar Justin Moore became the new co-host of the morning show on The Buzz, and it was renamed \"Morning Mayhem\". Fans still refer to Smith as \"Outlaw\", and he is considered a legend in central Arkansas radio. Smith has been married for many years to his wife Karen." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tommy_Smith_(DJ)> .

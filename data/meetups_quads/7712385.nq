<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deborah_Anderson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Deborah Leigh Anderson (born 16 December 1970) is an English musician, photographer, and film director. Her early music work was as a vocalist on her father Jon Anderson's albums. Her 1995 single \"Feel the Sunshine\" was her first song that charted, hitting the UK Dance and European Hot 100. She has also contributed vocals to a number of collaborative works with other recording artists. Her 2009 debut album Silence accompanied her photography book Paperthin, a work featuring photos of actors and musicians. Her photography work was featured on albums by singer Pink, and in Cosmopolitan, Vogue and other magazines. Her second photo book, Room 23, featured her pictures of celebrities in a collaboration with Sanela Diana Jenkins. In 2013, Anderson made her directorial debut with Aroused, a documentary film following the lives of 16 adult film actresses. Aroused was generally well received by critics, who note the film for the vulnerability of its subjects and compared Anderson's stylistic presentation to Annie Leibovitz and Michael Moore." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deborah_Anderson> .

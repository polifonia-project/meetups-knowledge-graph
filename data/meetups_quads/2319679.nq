Born to a Jewish family, he was one of the founding architects of the movement Amsterdam School (Expressionist architecture) Early in his career he worked for other architects, including Eduard Cuypers. For a while, he also employed the Indonesian-born Liem Bwan Tjie, who would later become his country's pioneering proponent of the Amsterdam School and modern architecture. Of his many outstanding designs, very few have actually been built. One of his finest completed buildings is 'Het Schip' (The Ship) in the Amsterdam district of Spaarndammerbuurt." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_de_Klerk> .

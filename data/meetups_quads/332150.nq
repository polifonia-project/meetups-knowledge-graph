<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Mangum> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeff Mangum (born 24 October 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who gained prominence as the founder, songwriter, vocalist and guitarist of Neutral Milk Hotel, as well for his co-founding of The Elephant 6 Recording Company. Mangum is characterized for his complex, lyrically dense songwriting, exemplified on the critically lauded album In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, as well as for his public image as a recluse associated with his extended periods of musical inactivity and minimal press interaction. An article published in Slate described Mangum as the \"Salinger of Indie Rock.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Mangum> .

Bollenback moved to India with his family when he was 11. After three years, the family returned to the U.S. and Bollenback began listening to rock music. He put down his nylon-string guitar and picked up an electric. He cites his discovery of Miles Davis as a pivotal moment in his life. He attended the University of Miami. In 1997, he began teaching at American University." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Bollenback> .

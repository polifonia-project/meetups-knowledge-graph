She competed in the individual 100 m, 4×100 m relay and high jump at the 1932 and 1936 Olympics and won two gold medals in the relay, setting a world record in 1932. She placed fifth in the individual 100 m in 1932 and sixth in the high jump in 1932 and 1936. Domestically she won the AAU outdoor titles in the 100 yards in 1933 and in the relay in 1931–1933.

Rogers was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, but at an early age moved to Chicago with her parents, John and Mary Rogers, two immigrants from Ireland. Rogers graduated from Senn High School in Chicago, and Northwestern University. She then worked as a teacher of physical education in the Chicago public school system, retiring in 1965.

In his role as a music Industry A&R (Artists & Repertoire) executive he has worked with artists and groups such as Janis Joplin, The Cars, Tool (band), Huey Lewis, Carlos Santana, and others. Artists to whose efforts Daly has contributed have sold in excess of 300 million singles and albums in vinyl, tape, CD, and digital download format. Moving from the Washington, D.C. area to San Francisco in the 1960s, Daly befriended Janis Joplin and was soon hired by Columbia Records as CBS Corporate San Francisco Head of A&R spanning the Clive Davis and Goddard Lieberson eras. Following that, Daly was named head of A&R at Elektra/Asylum Records, and later directly hired as Head of Artist & Repertoire by Ahmet Ertegun at Atlantic Records (WMG), where he worked under Doug Morris. He then worked with Zoo Entertainment (Bertelsmann Music Group) as both corporate Vice President and head of the Artists & Repertoire division. Daly is the recipient of multiple Gold Record and Platinum Record music recording certifications. Daly discovered and contracted musical artists such as The Cars, signing the band to a long-term Elektra/Asylum recording contract on a paper napkin after a live performance at Harvard University. The band’s first album, The Cars, stayed on the charts for 139 weeks and sold over six million copies in the US. Daly also discovered and brought The Tubes, a surreal SF theatrical rock band, to A&M Records. Daly also signed Bill Manspeaker’s Green Jellÿ to BMG/Zoo. Green Jelly members Maynard James Keenan and Danny Carey then founded Tool, again on BMG/Zoo. Daly has also worked professionally as a songwriter/musician with many other prominent artists and musicians, such as Roy Buchanan, Nils Lofgren and Boz Scaggs. Daly co-wrote Boz Scaggs’ \"Slow Dancer,\" which some consider to be the artist’s greatest musical achievement. Daly has also worked with Huey Lewis, Carlos Santana, and Alice Coltrane. Daly also worked with the family of Jimi Hendrix in producing The River of Color and Sound, an award-winning interactive multimedia biography of Carlos Santana." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Daly_(music_executive)> .

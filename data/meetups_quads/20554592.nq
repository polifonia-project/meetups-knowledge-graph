<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Griffin_III> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Lee Griffin III (born February 12, 1990), nicknamed RG3 and RGIII, is an American football quarterback who has played in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons. He played college football at Baylor, where he won the Heisman Trophy as a senior, and was selected second overall by the Washington Redskins in the 2012 NFL Draft. Griffin set league records for the highest rookie passer rating and touchdownâ€“interception ratio, while leading Washington to their first division title since 1999. He received Offensive Rookie of the Year and Pro Bowl honors, but was unable to duplicate his success due to a severe knee injury he suffered during the playoffs. Plagued by further injuries and inconsistent performances, Griffin lost his starting position in 2015 to Kirk Cousins, which led to Washington releasing him after the season. Griffin signed with the Cleveland Browns in 2016, but his tenure was also afflicted with injuries, resulting in his release by the season's end. After spending 2017 as a free agent, he joined the Baltimore Ravens in 2018 and played three seasons as a backup." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Griffin_III> .

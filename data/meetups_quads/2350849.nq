<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Pennell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joseph Pennell (July 4, 1857 â€“ April 23, 1926) was an American draftsman, etcher, lithographer and illustrator for books and magazines. A prolific artist, he spent most of his working life in Europe, and is known for his interest in landmarks, landscapes and industrial scenes around the world. A student of James Lambdin and Thomas Eakins, he was later influenced by James McNeill Whistler. Married to author Elizabeth Robins, Pennell was a writer in his own right. He published the anti-semitic The Jew at Home: Impressions of a Summer and Autumn Spent with Him (1892) and, later, the less controversial Lithographs of War (1914), Pictures of the Wonders of Work (1915), The Adventures of an Illustrator (1925). Later in life, he and his wife both wrote art criticism, and co-authored books." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Pennell> .

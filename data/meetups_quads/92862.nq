<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conrad_Hilton> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Conrad Nicholson Hilton Sr. (December 25, 1887 â€“ January 3, 1979) was an American businessman who founded the Hilton Hotels chain. From 1912 to 1916 Hilton was a Republican representative in the first New Mexico Legislature, but became disillusioned with the \"inside deals\" of politics. He purchased his first hotel in 1919 for $40,000, the Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas, which capitalized on the oil boom. The rooms were rented out in 8 hour shifts. He continued to buy and sell hotels and eventually established the world's first international hotel chain. When he died in 1979, he left the bulk of his estate to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conrad_Hilton> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Ovenden> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Graham Stuart Ovenden (born 11 February 1943) is an English painter, fine art photographer and writer. Some of Ovenden's art has been investigated as possible child pornography by US and UK authorities and in 2009, he was prosecuted in the UK on a charge of creating indecent images but not convicted. In 2013, Ovenden was found guilty of six charges of indecency with a child and one charge of indecent assault against a child, and on 9 October 2013, he was jailed for two years and three months by the Court of Appeal. Following his conviction, some galleries removed images of his work from display. In 2015, a judge ordered that Ovenden's personal collection of paintings and photographs be destroyed." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Ovenden> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nik_Freitas> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nik Freitas is a singer-songwriter from Visalia, California and currently residing in Los Angeles. Freitas began his career as a staff photographer for Thrasher Magazine where he traveled the world taking skate photos until turning his attention to music full-time in 2001. Since then, Freitas has released four records, almost all of which were produced entirely by him (he plays every instrument). Stylistically similar to musicians like The Beatles, Paul Simon and Elliott Smith, his fourth album, was released in 2008 by Conor Oberst's Team Love Records, leading to increased publicity. He has also participated with Oberst's back-up band, the Mystic Valley Band, performing two of his own songs on their debut album Outer South. He has been part of the performing band for the Broken Bells on their tour and also tours as a solo act to support his fifth album, Center of the World." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nik_Freitas> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jake_Brown_(skateboarder)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jake Brown (born 6 September 1974) is an Australian skateboarder who specialises in transition skateboarding. He began competing in 1996 and regularly appears as a contestant in the X Games contest events. Brown has also successfully skateboarded the \"MegaRamp\" structure, on which he is the first person to ever perform a 720-degree rotation without grabbing his board as of September 2013. During X Games 2007 he separated from his board 14m (45 feet) in the air, suffering multiple injuries in the fall, but walked away from the incident, winning Gold in the same competition in 2009 and successfully defending his title in 2010." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jake_Brown_(skateboarder)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vhong_Navarro> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ferdinand Hipolito Navarro (born January 4, 1977), known professionally as Vhong Navarro, is a Filipino comedian, actor, dancer, recording artist and television host. He is a regular host on ABS-CBN's noontime variety show It's Showtime. He is also part of the dance group Streetboys in the Philippines. On September 19, 2022, Navarro surrendered to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) after trial courts in Taguig issued him separate warrants for rape and \"acts of lasciviousness\" committed against Deniece Cornejo in 2014. Prosecutors said that the rape and molestations occurred at the hotel where Navarro was also falsely imprisoned and beaten by Cedric Lee and his accomplices as a result; the extent of his injuries made headlines at the time, and his assailants were eventually convicted. Navarro has maintained he did not rape Cornejo, claiming the pair did not engage in any sexual activity; and that Cornejo, Lee and his companions were seeking to extort him for financial gain. In December 2022, the court allowed Navarro to post â‚±1 million (roughly $18,000) bail." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vhong_Navarro> .

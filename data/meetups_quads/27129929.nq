<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reg_Meuross> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Reg Meuross is an English singer and songwriter based in Somerset. Meuross first emerged on the British acoustic music scene when he formed The Panic Brothers with comedian Richard Morton in 1986. Five years of touring and TV work followed their album In The Red, produced by Clive Gregson with the \"Brothers\" appearing regularly on TV, including Friday Night Live, and at Edinburgh, Sidmouth, Glastonbury and other festivals. Following his work with The Panic Brothers, Meuross formed a roots band, The Flamingos, featuring ex-Graham Parker guitarist Martin Belmont, Bob Loveday from the Penguin Café Orchestra & Bob Geldof's band and Alison Jones of The Barely Works. The Flamingos recorded the album Arrested in 1991. Meuross toured until 2009 with Hank Wangford and The Lost Cowboys as a member of the band and also as a solo artist with Hank Wangford on the \"No Hall Too Small\" tour. Meuross's solo recording and touring career began in 1996. As a solo artist he has released 14 albums. In his review of December in 2016 Robin Denselow described Meuross in The Guardian as \"…one of the more versatile, under-sung survivors of the English acoustic scene.\" Meuross co-wrote Seth Lakeman's first single \"Divided We Will Fall\" from the album The Well Worn Path released on the Cooking Vinyl label in November 2018." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reg_Meuross> .

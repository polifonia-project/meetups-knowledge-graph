In addition to his published written works, such as The Areas of My Expertise, More Information Than You Require, and That Is All, he is known for his personification of a PC in contrast to Justin Long's personification of a Mac in Apple's \"Get a Mac\" advertising campaign, and for his work as a contributor on Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. His writings have been published in One Story (to which he contributed the debut story \"Villanova\"), The Paris Review, McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, Wired and The New York Times Magazine, for which he is editor of the humor section. He contributes to This American Life, and CBC Radio Oneâ€™s Wiretap. His first book and accompanying audio narration, The Areas of My Expertise, a satirical tongue-in-cheek almanac that contains almost no factual information, was published in 2005. His second book, More Information Than You Require, went on sale October 21, 2008. His third book, That Is All, went on sale November 1, 2011. Vacationland: True Stories from Painful Beaches, a collection of \"real life wanderings\" about Hodgman's life experiences (especially in Western Massachusetts and coastal Maine) was published on October 24, 2017.

A hip hop artist who started under the name Razpy, he built his brand by releasing EPs, touring, and filming music videos through his company Black Umbrella. Simone gained recognition after releasing his debut solo EP, Solomon Samuel Simone. He became the subject of media coverage for his association with the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, part of the George Floyd protests in Seattle, in which he distributed a gun to a protester amid rumors the Proud Boys were gathering nearby." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raz_Simone> .

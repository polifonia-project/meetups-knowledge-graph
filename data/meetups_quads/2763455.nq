Henneman was named the Sporting News Rookie Pitcher of the Year in 1987, and led Tiger relief pitchers in wins and earned run average in both 1987 and 1988. Henneman was elected to the American League All-Star team in 1989. Henneman has the second most saves (154) in Tigers history, behind only Todd Jones. He graduated from St. Pius X High School in Festus, Missouri, and attended Jefferson College in nearby Hillsboro. In 1983, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Since retiring from baseball, Henneman has been a coach and roving instructor in the Tigers' minor league system.

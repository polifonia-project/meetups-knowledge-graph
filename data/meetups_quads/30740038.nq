Wing's Short title catalogue was a continuation of the earlier A Short-Title Catalogue of Books….1475-1640 (1928) compiled by Pollard and Redgrave. His Short-Title Catalogue became so popular that librarians and booksellers viewed it as an “indispensable tool.” Books referenced in Wing's Short-Title Catalogue became known as “Wing-books,” or books in published in the “Wing-period.” In 1999. American Libraries named him one of the 100 most important library leaders of the 20th century." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Wing> .

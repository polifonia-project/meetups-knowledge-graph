He was born in Antwerp in 1924, where his British father was working as a diamond dealer for De Beers. He was a great-grandson of the scholar Eliezer Liepman Philip Prins (1835-1915). His grandfather, Julius, was the founding president of the in London. He moved to London as a child where he was educated. He worked during World War II in a Spitfire engine factory making diamond tools. He began to work under his father but disliked working for De Beers, so he established his own firm, Industrial Diamond Company, exploiting the niche market for industrial diamonds. He took over his father's dealer business in 1949 and later expanded into mining. By the 1980s, his company had annual sales of $100 million. In 1948, Lunzer married Ruth Zippel, the Italian-born daughter of a Polish merchant. Her father had a collection of Hebrew books that she and Lunzer took to London as the basis for the Valmadonna Trust Library. Lunzer has five adult daughters: Margaret, Myra, Fiona, Alison and Caroline. Ruth Lunzer died in 1978. The daughters are the beneficiaries of the Valmadonna Trust. Lunzer died peacefully at home on 18 December 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jack_V._Lunzer> .

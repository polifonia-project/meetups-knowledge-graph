He was an eight-time All-Star and seven-time Gold Glove winner, who earned a championship as a top contributor to the 1964 World Series Champions (STL Cardinals). In 1989 White was elected President of the National League to replace Bart Giamatti, who succeeded Peter Ueberroth as Commissioner. White served as NL president until he retired in 1994. White became a full-time sportscaster after his playing career ended in 1969, and was the play-by-play man and color analyst for New York Yankees television and radio broadcasts for 18 years." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bill_White_(first_baseman)> .

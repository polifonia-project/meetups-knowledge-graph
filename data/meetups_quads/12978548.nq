<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marga_Scheide> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Margareth \"Marga\" Scheide (born 15 February 1954 in Amsterdam, Netherlands) is a Dutch singer and former model. She was a member of the girl group Luv'. Alongside Patty Brard and José Hoebee, she scored a string of international hit songs such as \"You're the Greatest Lover\", \"Trojan Horse\", \"Casanova\" and \"Ooh, Yes I Do\". She was the only Luv' singer to be involved in all the incarnations of the group. The formation went through line-up changes and the original singers reunited several times. In 2016, Marga, José and Ria Thielsch (who already replaced Patty in 1980) decided to relaunch Luv'. In July 2017, the ladies celebrated their 40th anniversary. On January 4, 2019, the group announced another line-up change in De Telegraaf: media personality Chimène van Oosterhout replaced Ria Thielsch. The renewed trio released a Latin pop-reggaeton single entitled With Him Tonight in July 2019, twenty-five years after their last album All You Need Is Luv'. On February 7th, 2020, the group's management informed that Luv' stopped all their activities due to José's ill health. In addition to Luv', Marga was active as a solo singer. On April 15th, 2022, she gave a farewell performance as a guest artist during Piv Huvluv's show in Belgium." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marga_Scheide> .

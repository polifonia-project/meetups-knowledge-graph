<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margaret_Sullavan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Margaret Brooke Sullavan (May 16, 1909 â€“ January 1, 1960) was an American stage and film actress. Sullavan began her career onstage in 1929 with the University Players. In 1933, she caught the attention of film director John M. Stahl and had her debut on the screen that same year in Only Yesterday. She continued to be a successful stage and film actress, and is most known today for The Shop Around the Corner. Sullavan preferred working on the stage and only made 16 film appearances, four of which were opposite close friend James Stewart in a popular partnership that included The Mortal Storm and The Shop Around the Corner. Stewart and Sullavan were also close friends of Henry Fonda, to whom Sullavan was married from 1931 to 1933. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Three Comrades (1938). She retired from the screen in the early 1940s to devote herself to her children and stage work. She returned to the screen in 1950 to make her last film, No Sad Songs for Me, in which she played a woman dying of cancer. For the rest of her career, she appeared only on the stage. Her most notable stage appearances were as Terry Randall in Stage Door, Sally Middleton in The Voice of the Turtle and Sabrina Fairchild in Sabrina Fair. Sullavan, who experienced deafness and depression during the 1950s, died on January 1, 1960 at the age of 50. The death was ruled an accidental overdose of barbiturates." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margaret_Sullavan> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinson_Cavani> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈeðinsoŋ kaˈβani]; born 14 February 1987) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for La Liga club Valencia and the Uruguay national team. Nicknamed El Matador ('The Bullfighter'), he is widely regarded to be one of the greatest strikers of all time, being known for his intelligent movement off the ball, clinical finishing, and heading ability. Cavani began his career playing for Danubio in Montevideo, where he played for two years, before moving to Italian side Palermo in 2007. In 2010, Cavani signed for Napoli, who signed him on an initial loan deal before buying him for a total fee of €17 million. He helped them win the Coppa Italia in 2012 and established himself as the most dominant striker in Serie A. In mid-2013, Cavani joined Paris Saint-Germain in France for a reported €64 million, at the time the most expensive signing in French football history. With PSG, Cavani won six Ligue 1 titles, five Coupes de la Ligue and four Coupes de France. He also ranks as the club's all-time top goalscorer. In 2020, Cavani signed with Manchester United. He scored 17 goals in his first season, including a goal in the UEFA Europa League Final. In 2022, Cavani signed for Valencia. Cavani scored on his Uruguay debut against Colombia in 2008, and has since then earned 135 caps and scored 58 international goals, only behind strike partner Luis Suárez among Uruguayan internationals. He has participated in ten major international tournaments: four FIFA World Cups (2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022), five Copas América (2011, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2021), and one FIFA Confederations Cup (2013). Cavani scored at the 2010 World Cup to help Uruguay to fourth place in the tournament, and in 2011 was part of the Uruguay squad that won a record fifteenth Copa América title. He finished as the CONMEBOL 2018 World Cup qualification top scorer with ten goals. During his time in Serie A, Cavani was named in the Serie A Team of the Year three times and was Serie A top scorer in the 2012–13 season. During his time in Ligue 1, he was named in the UNFP Ligue 1 Team of the Year three times, was awarded Ligue 1 Player of the Year for the 2016–17 season, and was the league's top scorer in the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons. He was awarded the Golden Foot in 2018 for his achievements in football." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinson_Cavani> .

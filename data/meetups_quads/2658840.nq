<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Carter_I> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert \"King\" Carter (4 August 1663 â€“ 4 August 1732) was a merchant, planter and powerful politician in colonial Virginia. Born in Lancaster County, Carter eventually became one of the richest men in the Thirteen Colonies. As President of the Virginia Governor's Council, Carter served as the royal governor of Virginia from 1726 to 1727 after the previous governor, Hugh Drysdale, died in office. He acquired the moniker \"King\" from fellow Virginians in his lifetime connoting his wealth, autocratic business methods and political power. Carter also served as the colony's Treasurer, many terms in the House of Burgesses and twice fellow members elected him as their Speaker." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Carter_I> .

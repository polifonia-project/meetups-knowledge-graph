<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Milutin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen Urosh II Milutin (Serbian Cyrillic: Стефан Урош II Милутин, romanized: Stefan Uroš II Milutin; c. 1253 – 29 October 1321), known as Stephen Milutin (Serbian Cyrillic: Стефан Милутин, romanized: Stefan Milutin), was the King of Serbia between 1282–1321, a member of the Nemanjić dynasty. He was one of the most powerful rulers of Serbia in the Middle Ages. Milutin is credited with strongly resisting the efforts of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos to impose Roman Catholicism on the Balkans after the Union of Lyons in 1274. During his reign, Serbian economic power grew rapidly, mostly due to the development of mining. He founded Novo Brdo, which became an internationally important silver mining site. As most of the Nemanjić monarchs, he was proclaimed a saint by the Serbian Orthodox Church with a feast day on October 30. Milutin appears in the Dante Alighieri's narrative poem Divine Comedy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Milutin> .

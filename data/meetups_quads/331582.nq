<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Coverdale> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Coverdale (born 22 September 1951) is an English rock singer best known for his work with Whitesnake, a hard rock band he founded in 1978. Before Whitesnake, Coverdale was the lead singer of Deep Purple from 1973 to 1976, after which he established his solo career. A collaboration with ex-Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page resulted in a '\"Coverdale-Page'\" studio album in 1993 that was subsequently certified platinum. In 2016, Coverdale was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple, giving one of the band's induction speeches. Coverdale is known in particular for his powerful, blues-tinged voice as well as his vibrant, caring, and loving stage persona. His vocal range is considered to be that of a leggero tenor." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Coverdale> .

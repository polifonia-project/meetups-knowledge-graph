<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robinson_Jeffers> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Robinson Jeffers (January 10, 1887 â€“ January 20, 1962) was an American poet, known for his work about the central California coast. Much of Jeffers's poetry was written in narrative and epic form. However, he is also known for his shorter verse and is considered an icon of the environmental movement. Influential and highly regarded in some circles, despite or because of his philosophy of \"inhumanism\", Jeffers believed that transcending conflict required human concerns to be de-emphasized in favor of the boundless whole. This led him to oppose U.S. participation in World War II, a stance that was controversial after the U.S. entered the war." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robinson_Jeffers> .

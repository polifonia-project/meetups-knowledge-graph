<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clara_Brown> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clara Brown (c. 1800â€“1885) was a former enslaved woman from Virginia and Kentucky who became a community leader, philanthropist and aided settlement of former slaves during the time of Colorado's Gold Rush. She was known as the 'Angel of the Rockies' and made her mark as Colorado's first black settler and a prosperous entrepreneur. Brown was born in Virginia in 1800 and moved to Logan County, Kentucky, with her family. She married another enslaved person when she was 18 and together they had four children. In 1835, Brown's family was broken apart when they were all sold to different slave owners. When Brown was 56, she received her freedom but was required by law to leave the state. She worked her way west as a cook and laundress to Denver, Colorado. Brown settled in the mining town now called Central City, Colorado where she worked as a laundress, cook, and midwife. With the money she made, she invested in properties and mines in nearby towns. Known as \"Aunt Clara\" for her emotional and financial support, Brown was a founding member of a Sunday school, made her home available for prayer services and generously supported the community. At the end of the Civil War, Brown could freely travel and liquidated all of her investments to travel to Kentucky to find her daughter. Although she was unsuccessful, she paid the way for 16 or more relatives and others who were former slaves to move to Colorado. Finally, in 1882 she reunited with her daughter Eliza Jane and Eliza Jane's daughter. In 1885, the last year of her life, Clara Brown was voted into the Society of Colorado Pioneers for her role in Colorado's early history." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clara_Brown> .

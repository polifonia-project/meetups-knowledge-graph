The two met while recording \"Another One Rides the Bus\" at the Dr. Demento show on September 14, 1980. Shortly after, Yankovic invited Schwartz to join his band, gave him the nickname \"Bermuda\" (\"Bermuda Schwartz\" being a play on the words \"Bermuda shorts\") and they have worked together ever since. Schwartz is heard and/or seen on all of Yankovic's albums, videos, and concerts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Schwartz_(drummer)> .

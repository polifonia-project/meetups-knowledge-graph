On 14 July 2010, Don released his much anticipated new Mandarin EP titled For My Dearest, in which Don has personally involved in much of the production of this new album, from selection of songs and style, to cover design and music video direction. This EP features five songs of single-word titles elucidating the different stages of a romantic relationship, infatuation, separation, reunion, and finally enlightenment. The EP also includes a bonus DVD containing three music videos, one of which features Vincy Chan and Yumiko Cheng." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Don_Li> .

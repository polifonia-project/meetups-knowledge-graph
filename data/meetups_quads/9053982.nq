Infamous, was a founding member of The-Allies DJ Crew (DJ Craze, DVLP and A-Trak) and is perhaps best known for his work with American rapper Lil Wayne. Infamous has produced songs for prominent recording artists such as Drake, Jay-Z, Meek Mill, Fat Joe, Nas, Game, Lupe Fiasco, Charlie Puth and Kendrick Lamar, among others. Although his current discography consists predominantly of rappers, Infamous is a multi-instrumentalist, who was once the guitar player and songwriter for rock band Antenna (formerly signed to Columbia Records), before meeting Lil Wayne." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infamous_(producer)> .

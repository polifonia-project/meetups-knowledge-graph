<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Levin_(attorney)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniel Bernard Levin (born March 4, 1956) served as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Justice Department from July 2004 until February 2005. He is notable for having upheld legal opinions during the Bush administration that narrowly defined torture and authorized enhanced interrogation techniques. These opinions were mostly secret during this period, but rumors of abuse of prisoners were widespread, particularly after the 2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner torture and abuse scandal in Iraq. These opinions were repudiated in 2009 by the Obama administration." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Levin_(attorney)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dock_Boggs> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Moran Lee \"Dock\" Boggs (February 7, 1898 â€“ February 7, 1971) was an American old-time singer, songwriter and banjo player. His style of banjo playing, as well as his singing, is considered a unique combination of Appalachian folk music and African-American blues. Contemporary folk musicians and performers consider him a seminal figure, at least in part because of the appearance of two of his recordings from the 1920s, \"Sugar Baby\" and \"Country Blues\", on Harry Smith's 1952 collection Anthology of American Folk Music. Boggs was first recorded in 1927 and again in 1929, although he worked primarily as a coal miner for most of his life. He was rediscovered during the folk music revival of the 1960s and spent much of his later life playing at folk music festivals and recording for Folkways Records." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dock_Boggs> .

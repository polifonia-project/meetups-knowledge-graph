<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yasmin_Ahmad> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Yasmin binti Ahmad (7 January 1958 â€“ 25 July 2009) was a Malaysian film director, writer and scriptwriter. She was the executive creative director at Leo Burnett Kuala Lumpur. Her television commercials and films are well known in Malaysia for being humorous and touching. Her work crossed cross-cultural barriers, particularly her ads for Petronas, the national oil and gas company. Her works have won multiple awards both within Malaysia and internationally. In Malaysia, her films were highly controversial due to their depiction of events and relationships, which have been considered 'forbidden' by social conservatives, especially hard-line interpretations of Islam. She was a central figure of the \"first\" New Wave of Malaysian cinema." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yasmin_Ahmad> .

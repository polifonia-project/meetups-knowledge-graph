<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincenzo_Silvano_Casulli> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vincenzo Silvano Casulli, usually known as Silvano Casulli (25 August 1944 – 24 July 2018) was an Italian amateur astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets at his Vallemare di Borbona Observatory (A55) in Lazio. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 192 minor planets. In 1985 he served on a team involved in using the Hubble Space Telescope in a study that focused on Transition Comets—UV Search for OH Emissions in Asteroids. He was the first amateur astronomer to obtain precise astronometric positions of minor planets using a CCD camera. He is a prolific discoverer of asteroids. In 1997, the inner main-belt asteroid and member of the Flora family, 7132 Casulli, was named by astronomer Antonio Vagnozzi in his honor (M.P.C. 30800)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vincenzo_Silvano_Casulli> .

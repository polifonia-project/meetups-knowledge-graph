<http://dbpedia.org/resource/A._L._Rowse> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alfred Leslie Rowse CH FRSL FBA FRHistS (4 December 1903 â€“ 3 October 1997) was a British historian and writer, best known for his work on Elizabethan England and books relating to Cornwall. Born in Cornwall and raised in modest circumstances, he was encouraged to study for Oxford by fellow-Cornishman Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. He was elected a fellow of All Souls College and later appointed lecturer at Merton College. Best known of his many works was The Elizabethan Age trilogy. His work on Shakespeare included a claim to have identified the 'Dark Lady of the Sonnets' as Emilia Lanier, which attracted much interest from scholars, but also many counterclaims. Rowse was in steady demand as a lecturer in North America. In the 1930s, he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as a Labour candidate, though later in life he became a conservative." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/A._L._Rowse> .

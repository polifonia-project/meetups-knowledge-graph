In 1981, she entered the newly formed joint program in toxicology at Rutgers University/University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, earning Rutgersâ€™ first PhD in toxicology in 1984. As a pre-doctoral Eli Lilly fellow, she studied the role of metabolism in the toxicology and carcinogenicity of benzene. Gilmour continued her research at The Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, first as postdoctoral fellow (1984 to 1987) and then as research associate (1988 to 1990). Gilmour joined the scientific research staff at LIMR in 1990 and was appointed professor in 2001.

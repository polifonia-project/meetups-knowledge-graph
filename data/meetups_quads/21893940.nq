Tom Kennedy is the son of a professional trumpet player. He began playing acoustic bass at the age of nine on a double-bass brought home by his older brother, jazz pianist Ray Kennedy. Soon he began to perform with many nationally recognized artists passing through the Midwest. Kennedy specialized in acoustic jazz until his introduction to the electric bass at the age of 17. Soon he was dividing his time between mainstream jazz and progressive jazz fusion. He moved to New York City in 1984." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tom_Kennedy_(musician)> .

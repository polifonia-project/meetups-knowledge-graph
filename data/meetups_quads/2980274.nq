<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billy_Kersands> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Billy Kersands (c. 1842 in Baton Rouge Louisiana, â€“1915 in Artesia New Mexico) was an African-American comedian and dancer. He was the most popular black comedian of his day, best known for his work in blackface minstrelsy. In addition to his skillful acrobatics, dancing, singing, and instrument playing, Kersands was renowned for his comic routines involving his large mouth, which he could contort comically or fill with objects such as billiard balls or saucers. His stage persona was that of the dim-witted black man of the type that had been popularized in white minstrel shows. Modern commentators such as Mel Watkins cite him as one of the earliest black entertainers to have faced the dilemma of striking a balance between social satire and the reinforcement of negative stereotypes." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Billy_Kersands> .

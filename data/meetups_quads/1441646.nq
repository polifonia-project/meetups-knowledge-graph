<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Marchand> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Louis Marchand (2 February 1669 â€“ 17 February 1732) was a French Baroque organist, harpsichordist, and composer. Born into an organist's family, Marchand was a child prodigy and quickly established himself as one of the best known French virtuosos of his time. He worked as organist of numerous churches and, for a few years, as one of the four organistes du roy. Marchand had a violent temperament and an arrogant personality, and his life was filled with scandals, publicized and widely discussed both during his lifetime and after his death. Despite his fame, few of his works survive to this day, and those that do almost all date from his early years. Nevertheless, a few pieces of his, such as the organ pieces Grand dialogue and Fond d'orgue have been lauded as classic works of the French organ school." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Marchand> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucy_Broadwood> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lucy Etheldred Broadwood (9 August 1858 â€“ 22 August 1929) was an English folksong collector and researcher, and great-granddaughter of John Broadwood, founder of the piano manufacturers Broadwood and Sons. As one of the founder members of the Folk-Song Society and Editor of the Folk-Song Journal, she was one of the main influences of the British folk revival of that period. She was an accomplished singer, composer, piano accompanist, and amateur poet. She was much sought after as a song and choral singing adjudicator at music festivals throughout England, and was also one of the four main organisers of the Leith Hill Music Festival in Surrey from its commencement in 1904 until her death in 1929." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucy_Broadwood> .

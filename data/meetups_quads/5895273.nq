She was a first cousin of the American sculptor Leonard Baskin. Born in New York City in 1911 by Russian American parents, Sophie Maslow began her dance training with Blanche Talmud at the . Her teachers there included Martha Graham and Louis Horst. She became a member of Martha Graham's Company in 1931, performing many solo roles, until 1943. She created her own dance troupe, The Sophie Maslow Dance Company and, with Jane Dudley and William Bales, established the Dudley-Maslow-Bales Trio in 1942. Ms. Maslow helped to define and establish New Dance Group as a performance entity dedicated to using dance to make social and political statements. In 1948, she performed and was a faculty member at the first American Dance Festival held at Connecticut College. Maslow's choreography includes: \"Dust Bowl Ballads\" which depicted the Depression of the 1930s and the people of the Southwest's endurance during these droughts, \"Folksay\" based on Carl Sandburg's poem of the same name, \"Poem,\" with music by Duke Ellington and words by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and the off-Broadway musical \"The Big Winner\" about a poor tailor and his winning lottery ticket. In 1951, she choreographed for the New York City Opera (The Dybbuk). In 1952, 1955, 1956, and 1960–62, Maslow choreographed the Hannukkah Festivals held at Madison Square Garden. Her dances have been reconstructed and performed by CityDance Ensemble, The Harkness Ballet, The Batsheva Dance Company, and The Bat-Dor Company. Sophie Maslow's voice and altruism remain an inspiration for New Dance Group Arts Center. Maslow was Jewish. She died on June 25, 2006 in Manhattan at age 95." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sophie_Maslow> .

Widely recognized as one of the best riders of all time, Robinson was integral in creating Megaramp disciplines for BMX. Aside from this, Robinson was most notable for two stunts in his career: He was the first to successfully land a (double backflip with 180 degree horizontal rotation) in competition at the 2006 X Games and, in 2016, set the Guinness World record for the highest air on a BMX (27 feet) in his home town of East Providence, Rhode Island. Robinson was a longtime sponsor of Hoffman Bikes, Red Bull, and Target. Robinson died of a stroke, ten days shy of his 46th birthday, on December 9, 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Robinson_(BMX_rider)> .

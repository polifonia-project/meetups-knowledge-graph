<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anna_Bishop> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anna Bishop (9 January 1810 â€“ 18 March 1884) was an English operatic soprano. She sang in many countries on every continent, and was the most widely travelled singer of the 19th century. She was married to the composer Henry Bishop but abandoned him for the French harpist, composer and entrepreneur Nicolas-Charles Bochsa. She and Bochsa were said to have been the inspiration for Trilby and Svengali in George du Maurier's 1894 novel Trilby." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anna_Bishop> .

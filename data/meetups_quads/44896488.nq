<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_MacFarlane> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "George MacFarlane (November 17, 1878 â€“ February 22, 1932) was a Canadian-born American actor of both the stage and screen. He began his stage career in Montreal, before moving to New York City. His short film career spanned both the silent and sound film eras. In addition to his acting, he was also a well-known recording artist, who was very popular during World War I, including at least one song which reached number one on the charts in 1915. His career was cut short when he died in an accident in 1932." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_MacFarlane> .

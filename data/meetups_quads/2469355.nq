<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_La_Farge> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Oliver Hazard Perry La Farge II (December 19, 1901 â€“ August 2, 1963) was an American writer and anthropologist. In 1925 he explored early Olmec sites in Mexico, and later studied additional sites in Central America and the American Southwest. In addition to more than 15 scholarly works, mostly about Native Americans, he wrote several novels, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning, Laughing Boy (1929). La Farge also wrote and published short stories, in such leading magazines as The New Yorker and Esquire. His more notable works, both fiction and non-fiction, emphasize Native American culture. He was most familiar with the Navajo people, had a speaking knowledge of their language, and was nicknamed by them 'Anast'harzi Nez', i.e. \"Tall Cliff-Dweller\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_La_Farge> .

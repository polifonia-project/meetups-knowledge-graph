<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ragheb_Alama> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ragheb Alama (Arabic: راغب علامة born 7 June 1962) is a Lebanese singer, dancer, composer, television personality, and philanthropist. Alama began his career in the 1980s when he appeared as a contestant on the talent show broadcast Studio El Fan, on which he received the Platinum Award. Alama's fame came after Studio El Fan followed by yearly albums and number-one hit singles such as \"Ya rait\" (If Only), \"'Aan Jad\" (Seriously) and \"Alby Asheq'ha\" (My Heart Adores Her) which was the first Arabic song in history to be made into a music video. Alama continued his success into the 2000s with the release of his chart-topping albums Saharony El Leil (2001), Tab Leh (2002), El Hob El Kebeer (2004) and Ba'asha'ak (2008), the latter which earned the artist the Platinum certification from Virgin Megastores for its record sales. One of his recent albums Seneen Rayha (2010) saw the artist team with Starbucks for its release and sale, making him the first Arab artist to have his album sold at Starbucks. The Starbucks album Starz Vol. 1 also included a song featuring international pop artist Shakira. He adopted an environmental cause with the album after being named the United Nations Ambassador of Climate Change. Alama has won two Murex d'Or Awards and several other awards during his career. His albums have made him one of the most commercially successful singers in the Arab world. In mid-2011, it was announced that Alama would head the judging panel for the pan-Arab version of the American Idol series." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ragheb_Alama> .

He was previously the head coach and GM of the OHA Peterborough Petes (1977–79) and coach of the AHL Hershey Bears (1979–80). He won the OHA Coach of the Year award in 1978-79. When Green replaced Danny Belisle as head coach of the Capitals during the 1979–80 NHL season, he was 26, making him the youngest head coach in NHL history. After getting fired by the Capitals in 1981, Green joined the USA Network as a color commentator on their NHL telecasts, and remained there until 1985. In 1987, he joined TSN, where he stayed until 2004. With TSN, he covered college hockey, Canada Cup Hockey, TSN Hockey and IIHF events, notably the World Junior Championships and World Championships, and national hockey telecasts on TSN along with Jim Hughson and Paul Romanuk. He also covered the NHL Entry Draft from 1990 to 1998. In 1995, he also worked on a few NHL telecasts for Fox. In addition to national television duties, he has acted as a colour commentator for regional TV broadcasts of the Winnipeg Jets (1985–1996) and Montreal Canadiens (1998–2002). In recent years, he has coached the Canadian entry at the Spengler Cup tournament in Davos, Switzerland, and provided analysis for the NHL Network and NHL Radio." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gary_Green_(ice_hockey)> .

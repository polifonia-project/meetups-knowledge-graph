Leaf's 1978 biography The Beach Boys and the California Myth examined the behind-the-scenes tensions and family history that had never been covered before. According to music critic Richie Unterberger, Leaf was \"the first author to write extensively, and honestly, about the Beach Boys.\" Leaf also wrote the first authorized biography of the Bee Gees. Since 2010, Leaf has been a professor at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Leaf> .

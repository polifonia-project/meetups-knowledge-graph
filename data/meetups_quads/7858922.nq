<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vittoria_della_Rovere> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vittoria della Rovere (7 February 1622 â€“ 5 March 1694) was Grand Duchess of Tuscany as the wife of Grand Duke Ferdinando II. She had four children with her husband, two of whom would survive infancy: the future Cosimo III, Tuscany's longest-reigning monarch, and Francesco Maria, a prince of the Church. At the death of her grandfather Francesco Maria della Rovere, she inherited the Duchies of Rovere and Montefeltro, which reverted to her second son, Francesco Maria, at her death. She was later entrusted with the care of her three grandchildren. Her marriage brought a wealth of treasures to the House of Medici, which can today be seen in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi Gallery in Florence." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vittoria_della_Rovere> .

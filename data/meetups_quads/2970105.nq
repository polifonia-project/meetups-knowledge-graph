He is the youngest of three children, including an older sister and older brother. Their parents abandoned them at an early age, and they were forced to make a living instead of going to school. Also known as Xiao Gang (he later decided to use his real name when he became a full-time composer), Steve Chou started singing and composing in 1989, and has written a variety of well-known Chinese songs performed by famous singers and himself. In 2000, his album \"\" contained the hit \"黃昏\"(Dusk), which was his breakthrough song. In 2003, he released another album, \"Dubbing 我在身邊\" (By Your Side), which included many famous songs he had previously written, as well as new material. His 2004 album \"Mixing 男人海洋\" (Man. Ocean) wasn't less warmly received. His next album, \"星空下的傳說\" (The Legend Underneath the Starry Sky), came out in 2005 and contained the song \"寂寞沙洲冷\"(Cold and Lonely Desert), which won many music awards. In 2010, a new digital single \"苦情歌\" (Sad Song) already charted as of early November. Chou Chuan-huing [Timeless] 2016 World Tour in Shanghai will be held at Mercedes-Benz Arena (Shanghai Expo Culture Center) on June 11, 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chou_Chuan-huing> .

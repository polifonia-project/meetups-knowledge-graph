<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_of_Russia> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael I (Russian: Михаил Фёдорович Романов, Mikhaíl Fyódorovich Románov) (22 July [O.S. 12 July] 1596 – 22 July [O.S. 13 July] 1645) became the first Russian tsar of the House of Romanov after the Zemskiy Sobor of 1613 elected him to rule the Tsardom of Russia. He was the son of Feodor Nikitich Romanov (later known as Patriarch Filaret) and of Xenia Shestova (later known as \"the great nun\" Martha). He was also a first cousin once removed of the last Rurikid Tsar Feodor I through his great-aunt Anastasia Romanovna, who was the mother of Feodor I, and through marriage, a great-nephew in-law with Tsar Ivan IV of Russia. His accession marked the end of the Time of Troubles. During his reign, Russia conquered most of Siberia with the help of the Cossacks and the Stroganov family. Russia had extended from the vicinity of the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean by the end of Michael's reign." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_of_Russia> .

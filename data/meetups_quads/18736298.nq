<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hyun-jin_Ryu> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hyun-jin Ryu (Korean: 류현진; Hanja: 柳賢振; Korean pronunciation: [ȴu.çʌndʑin]; born March 25, 1987) is a South Korean professional baseball pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for the Los Angeles Dodgers and in the KBO League for the Hanwha Eagles. In 2013, after spending seven seasons with the Eagles, he became the first player from the KBO to join an MLB team via the posting system. Ryu is the first Korean pitcher to start in a World Series game. In 2019, Ryu earned a selection to his first career Major League Baseball All-Star Game. During that season, he led the Majors in earned run average (ERA) and achieved an ERA of 1.26 through his first 14 starts, the lowest by a Dodgers pitcher since the statistic became official in 1912." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hyun-jin_Ryu> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norbert_Guterman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Norbert Guterman (1900–1984) was a scholar, and translator of scholarly and literary works from French, Polish and Latin into English. His translations were remarkable for their range of subject matter and high quality. Born in Warsaw, Guterman attended the University of Warsaw, where he studied psychology. He moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, where he continued his studies in psychology, receiving degrees in 1922 and 1923. In the 1930s, Guterman worked closely with French Marxist theorist Henri Lefebvre in popularizing the Marxist notions of alienation and mystification. He published translations of Marx's early works, which were often the first publications of these works in any language. Guterman, who was Jewish, moved to the United States in 1933, where he took on translation work for the Monthly Review, eventually becoming an editor. He later became interested in Hassidic Judaism, though it is not clear if he became observant or was a hasid of a specific rebbe. In 1936 he became an associate member of the Institute for Social Research on the recommendation of Max Horkheimer who held a great deal of respect for him. In 1949 he co-published Prophets of Deceit with Leo Löwenthal. His papers are kept in the Butler Library of Columbia University." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norbert_Guterman> .

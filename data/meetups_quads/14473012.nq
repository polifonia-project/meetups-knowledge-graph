<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noel_Marshall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Noel Marshall (April 18, 1931 â€“ June 30, 2010) was an American agent, co-producer, and briefly a director, and actor. He moved to Hollywood, California, in his 20s and began investing in the production of a handful of films, including William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist. In the 1970s, Marshall and his family, including his wife, Tippi Hedren, and step-daughter, Melanie Griffith, began production on Roar, which is notorious for its 11 year accident-ridden production due to the many production mishaps and damages caused on-set. The cast and crew worked with real big cats, leading to 70 people being injured during the making of the film. It later received the tagline \"The most dangerous movie ever made\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Noel_Marshall> .

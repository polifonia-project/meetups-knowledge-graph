<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hiili_Hiilesmaa> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kai \"Hiili\" Hiilesmaa (born December 1966) is a Finnish record producer and musician. He is the vocalist of the rock band The Skreppers, former drummer of the doom metal band KYPCK and former keyboardist of the rock band Daniel Lioneye. He has worked with several internationally recognized rock groups, including his near 20-year association with Finnish band HIM. Hiilesmaa began producing music professionally in 1995, recording with such bands as HIM, Amorphis and Apocalyptica. His trademarks include heavy, overdriven guitar sounds and experimental synthesiser programming. In 2013, Hiilesmaa addressed his preference for analog recording, saying \"I prefer analog these days. Not only the sound, it asks more attitude to work with analog. Also you must make up your mind faster. There is no 'undo' in analog, which is often good.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hiili_Hiilesmaa> .

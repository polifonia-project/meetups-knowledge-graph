<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Gordon_(choreographer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Gordon (July 14, 1936 â€“ January 29, 2022) was an American dancer, choreographer, writer, and theatrical director prominent in the world of postmodern dance and performance. Based in New York City, Gordon's work has been seen in major performance venues across the United States, Europe, South America and Japan, and has appeared on television on PBS's Great Performances and Alive TV, and the BBC and Channel 4 in Great Britain. Twice a Guggenheim Fellow (1981 and 1987), Gordon has been a panelist of the dance program panels of the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts, and chairman of the former. He was a member of the Actors Studio, and was a founder of the Center for Creative Research. Gordon was married to Valda Setterfield, a dancer and actress born in England, who was for 10 years a featured soloist with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. She appears regularly in Gordon's work, and has been referred to as his \"muse\". Together, they have been called \"The Barrymores of postmodern dance.\" Their son, playwright, actor, and theatrical director Ain Gordon, has collaborated with Gordon on a number of projects. Gordon's work has been archived in the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. Gordon also created a digital archive called Archiveography which covers both his personal and professional lives." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Gordon_(choreographer)> .

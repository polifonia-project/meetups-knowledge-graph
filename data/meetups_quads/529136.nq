<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Webber> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mayce Edward Christopher Webber III (born March 1, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player. Drafted number one overall by the Orlando Magic, though arguably best known and remembered as the star forward for the Sacramento Kings, Webber became a 5-time NBA All-Star, a 5-time All-NBA Team member, and the NBA Rookie of the Year. He also played for the Washington Bullets, Philadelphia 76ers, and Detroit Pistons. As a collegiate athlete, he was a first-team All-American and led the Michigan Wolverines' 1991 incoming freshman class known as the Fab Five that reached the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship games as freshmen and sophomores. However, Webber was indicted by a federal grand jury and stripped of his All-American honors by the NCAA as a result of his direct involvement in the Ed Martin scandal. He is also a former National High School Basketball Player of the Year who led his high school Detroit Country Day to three Michigan State High School Basketball Championships. He now does on-air commentary for NBA games, in addition to teaching at schools including Wake Forest University and Morehouse College. On May 16, 2021, after being eligible since 2013, it was announced Webber would be a part of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Webber> .

His record albums were among the most popular of easy listening and space age pop organists of the 1950s through the early 1970s. His signature hit, \"Plantation Boogie\", charted as a Top 20 hit in 1955. He also had a gold record with 1970's Spinning Wheel. Dee played a variety of songs in numerous styles. He played original compositions, popular songs, and novelty tunes, and was a master of improvisation. Although his unique style was a pop/boogie-woogie blend, he also played ballads, country and western, jazz, rock, and patriotic songs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lenny_Dee_(organist)> .

Active since the 1980s, Kwok is known as one of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Hong Kong pop music. Dubbed the \"God of Dance\", Kwok's onstage dancing is influenced by the late American performer Michael Jackson. He has released over 30 studio albums in Cantonese and Mandarin, mostly in the dance-pop genre, with elements of rock, R&B, soul, electronica and traditional Chinese music. Concurrently with his music career, Kwok started as an actor with a role in the TVB television drama Genghis Khan (1987), followed by Twilight of a Nation (1988), Man from Guangdong (1991), Heartstrings (1994), and Wars of Bribery (1996). He gained widespread recognition in the movie Saviour of the Soul (1991), for which he was nominated for a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, before starring in a string of box-office hits, including Future Cops (1993), China Strike Force (2000), Divergence (2005), After This Our Exile (2006), Port of Call (2015), and Project Gutenberg (2018)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aaron_Kwok> .

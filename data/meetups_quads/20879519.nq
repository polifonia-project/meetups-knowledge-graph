<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ketzel_Levine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ketzel Levine is an American radio journalist who began her broadcast career in 1974. She joined National Public Radio (NPR) in 1977 and worked, variously, as the network's arts producer, sports director, features reporter and garden expert. From 2000 through 2008, she was senior correspondent for the NPR program Morning Edition. At the end of that year, due to cutbacks at the network, Levine was laid off, while working on a documentary series about Americans coping with economic stress and job loss. Her final NPR broadcast was about how she, herself, had just lost her job." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ketzel_Levine> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Carter> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniel William Carter ONZM (born 5 March 1982) is a retired New Zealand rugby union player. Carter played for Crusaders (Super Rugby) in New Zealand and played for New Zealand's national team, the All Blacks. He is the highest point scorer in test match rugby, and is considered by many experts as the greatest ever first five-eighth (fly-half) in the history of the game. He was named the International Rugby Board Player of the Year in 2005, 2012 and 2015 (equaling the record three awards of Richie McCaw) and has won three Super Rugby titles with the Crusaders, and nine Tri-Nations and Rugby Championships with the All Blacks. Carter injured his groin while doing kicking practice during the 2011 Rugby World Cup but was a key member of the 2015 Rugby World Cup-winning teams, becoming one of 21 players to have won multiple Rugby World Cups. In the 2015 Rugby World Cup Final against Australia, he kicked four penalties, two conversions and a drop goal, and was named the man of the match. In 2015, Carter released his autobiography named 'Dan Carter: The Autobiography of an All Blacks Legend'. In 2019, 'Dan Carter: A Perfect 10', a documentary film about Carter's personal life and the challenges he encountered on his road to winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup was released." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Carter> .

She was born in Boscawen, New Hampshire, the daughter of Timothy Dix and Abigail Wilkins and the sister of General John Adams Dix of New York. She married John Whiting Sullivan in 1825 and had one son, John Henry, who died of drowning in 1858. Little is known about her background, but she was considered the first American woman to write a \"hit\" song, \"The Blue Juniata,\" which was referenced by Mark Twain in his autobiography. The Blue Juniata was the basis for variation sets by other well-known 19th century American composers, such as Charles Grobe and J. Edgar Gould. The song was recorded in 1937 by Roy Rogers and the early Sons of the Pioneers. The song was also referenced with the full lyrics by Laura Ingalls Wilder in her book Little House on the Prairie." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marion_Dix_Sullivan> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winthrop_M._Crane> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Winthrop Murray Crane (commonly referred to as W. Murray Crane or simply Murray Crane; April 23, 1853 â€“ October 2, 1920) was a U.S. political figure and businessman. In 1879, he secured his family company, paper manufacturer Crane & Co., an exclusive government contract to supply the paper for United States currency, a monopoly the company holds to this day. During the 1890s he became increasingly active in state Republican politics, and became a dominant figure in the local, state, and national party. He was successively elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts (in 1896) and Governor of Massachusetts (in 1899). In 1904, he was appointed to the United States Senate and served until 1913. Crane advised Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. His success as Governor in defusing a Teamsters strike prompted Roosevelt to bring him in as a negotiator to resolve the Coal Strike of 1902. He refused repeated offers for cabinet-level positions and was known to dislike campaigning and giving speeches. Near the end of his career, he served as a political mentor to future President Calvin Coolidge, who was elected Vice President one month after Crane's death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winthrop_M._Crane> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Texas_Guinan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Louise Cecilia \"Texas\" Guinan (January 12, 1884 â€“ November 5, 1933) was an American actress, producer and entrepreneur. Born in Texas to Irish immigrant parents, Guinan decided at an early age to become an entertainer. After becoming a star on the New York stage, the repercussions of her involvement in a weight loss scam motivated her to switch careers to the film business. Spending several years in California appearing in numerous productions, she eventually formed her own company. She is most remembered for the speakeasy clubs she managed during Prohibition. Her clubs catered to the rich and famous, as well as to aspiring talent. After being arrested and indicted during a law enforcement sweep of speakeasy clubs, she was acquitted during her trial." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Texas_Guinan> .

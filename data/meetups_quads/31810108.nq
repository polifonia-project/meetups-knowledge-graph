<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furio_Piccirilli> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Furio Piccirilli (March 27, 1868 â€“ January 17, 1949) was an Italian-born American sculptor and one of the Piccirilli Brothers. Piccirilli was born in Massa, Italy into a family with a long tradition of carving and sculpting. Like his older brother Attilio he was educated at the Accademia di San Luca of Rome. With his brother Attilio he immigrated to England in the mid-1880s and then moved to the United States in 1888. With their father and brothers he helped establish the Piccirilli Brothers carving business. He was a well known and respected sculptor aside from being known in connection with his family firm. He was \"considered the most creative and the best modeler\" of all the brothers. Piccirilli Brothers carved the architectural sculpture for the Parliament Building in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Furio modeled the four larger-than-life seated figures that flank the side entrances. Furio returned to Italy to get married in 1921, and then moved there permanently in 1926. He died in Rome in 1949." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furio_Piccirilli> .

In the latter part of her career, she became a successful businessperson in the film security industry, while at the same time enjoying modest success as a Canadian film and television actress. She was nominated for a Juno Award in 1981 in the category of Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year. She also hosted her own national CBC Television series, Dianne, in 1971. In May 1993, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer from which she died on October 22, 1996, aged 48, in Toronto." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dianne_Heatherington> .

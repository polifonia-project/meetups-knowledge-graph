<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russell_Wilson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Russell Carrington Wilson (born November 29, 1988) is an American football quarterback for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). He previously played in the NFL for the Seattle Seahawks, winning Super Bowl XLVIII. Wilson played college football and baseball at NC State from 2008 to 2010 before transferring to Wisconsin in 2011, where he set the single-season FBS record for passing efficiency (191.8) and led them to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. He also played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman. The Seahawks selected Wilson in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft. He tied Peyton Manning's then-record for most passing touchdowns by a rookie (26) and was named Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year. Wilson has been named to nine Pro Bowls and helped lead the Seahawks to two consecutive Super Bowls, winning Super Bowl XLVIII over the Broncos. He holds the record for most wins by an NFL quarterback through nine seasons (98) and is one of four quarterbacks in NFL history with a career passer rating over 100. In April 2019, Wilson signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension with the Seahawks, making him the highest paid player in the NFL at the time. In 2020, he became just the third quarterback in NFL history to throw for thirty touchdowns in four consecutive seasons. Wilson is widely regarded as one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks in NFL history. Wilson is part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won the 2019 MLS Cup." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russell_Wilson> .

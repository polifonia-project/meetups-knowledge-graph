He is best known for his masterpiece A Woman Killed with Kindness, a domestic tragedy, which was first performed in 1603 at the Rose Theatre by the Worcester's Men company. He was a prolific writer, claiming to have had \"an entire hand or at least a maine finger in two hundred and twenty plays\", although only a fraction of his work has survived." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Heywood> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mile_Stojkoski> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mile Stojkoski (Macedonian: Миле Стојкоски; born 4 May 1965), is a Macedonian athlete and humanitarian known for going on long-distance marathon runs (ultramarathons) in his wheelchair preceding the Summer Olympic Games. In 1996 he experienced a spinal cord injury from a motorcycle accident leaving him paraplegic, losing use of both his legs. After much emotional struggle and learning about living with his disability he got involved in sports and humanitarian nonprofit organizations. This eventually led him to focus on ultramarathons in his wheelchair with primary goal to raise public awareness and funds in support of people with disabilities in Macedonia. Since 2004 he has gone on nine marathons (4 ultramarathons) gaining public recognition and awards. On 15 March 2012 he started his 10th marathon from Kruševo, Macedonia heading for the 2012 London Summer Olympics." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mile_Stojkoski> .

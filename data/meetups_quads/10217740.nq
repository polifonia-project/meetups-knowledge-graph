<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_McCormick> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "George Donald King McCormick (11 December 1911 â€“ 2 January 1998) was a British journalist and popular historian, who also wrote under the pseudonym Richard Deacon. After working for Naval Intelligence during the Second World War, McCormick was a journalist for the foreign desk of the Sunday Times, at one point working with Ian Fleming. In his prolific output as a historian, McCormick was attracted to controversial topics on which verifiable evidence was scarce. He wrote on the Hellfire Club, Jack the Ripper, the Cambridge Apostles and rather extensively about spies. He wrote histories of the Russian, Chinese, Japanese, British, and Israeli secret services, and biographies of Sir Maurice Oldfield and Ian Fleming." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_McCormick> .

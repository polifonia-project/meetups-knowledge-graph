<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyril_Rootham> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Cyril Bradley Rootham /ˈruːtəm/ (5 October 1875 – 18 March 1938) was an English composer, educator and organist. His work at Cambridge University made him an influential figure in English music life. A Fellow of St John's College, where he was also organist, Rootham ran the Cambridge University Musical Society, whose innovative concert programming helped form English musical tastes of the time. One of his students was the younger composer Arthur Bliss, who valued his tuition in orchestration. Rootham's own compositions include two symphonies and several smaller orchestral pieces, an opera, chamber music, and many choral settings. Among his solo songs are some settings of verses by Siegfried Sassoon which were made in co-operation with the poet." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyril_Rootham> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gunter_Christmann> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gunter Christmann (23 April 1936 – 19 November 2013) was a German-born Australian painter. Born in Berlin, Christmann emigrated to Australia in 1959. Regarded as a painter's painter, Christmann has been making abstract and figurative paintings since the early 1960s and has exhibited frequently since 1965 throughout Australia and overseas. He has been labelled as one of the major Australian artists of his generation and 'one of Australia's best kept secrets' by art historian and curator Mary Eagle. Christmann rose to prominence with his inclusion in the landmark exhibition The Field at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968. From his hard edged colourfield paintings of the 1960s he went on to produce the \"sprinkle\" paintings of the 1970s. Throughout his different phases Christmann has maintained a fascination with the world around him, feeding off contemporary life, with his more recent works incorporating a ‘'tag\" graffiti style that is drawn across his paintings, sometimes in almost obsessive repetition." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gunter_Christmann> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arik_Brauer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Arik Brauer (Hebrew: אריק בראואר; 4 January 1929 – 24 January 2021) was an Austrian painter, printmaker, poet, dancer, singer-songwriter, stage designer, architect, and academic teacher. Brauer, from a family of Jewish emigrants, grew up in Vienna under the Nazi regime. After World War II, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from age 16, and from 1947 also singing. He travelled extensively, and married in Israel in 1957, settling in Paris where he formed a singing duo with his wife. From 1963, they lived in Ein Hod, Israel, and in Vienna. Brauer was a co-founder of the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism. Called an Universalkünstler (all-round artist) in Austria, he appeared as a singer-songwriter at the beginning of Austropop in the 1970s, taught at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1985, and designed buildings in Austria and Israel in the 1990s. His art was exhibited at international galleries and museums, and especially at major museums in Vienna, a graphic retrospective at the Albertina in 1974, at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in 1976, the Jewish Museum in New York in 1978, and an exhibition travelling the world (Weltwanderausstellung) from 1979 to 1983. A cycle of illustrations of the Haggadah was shown at the Jewish Museum Vienna in 2014, a retrospective at the Leopold Museum the same year, and Alle meine Künste, a documentation of the development in the context of his biography at the Jewish Museum in 2019 on the occasion of his 90th birthday. Among many awards are the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art (2002), the Amadeus Austrian Music Award for his lifetime achievement (2015), and the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (2018)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arik_Brauer> .

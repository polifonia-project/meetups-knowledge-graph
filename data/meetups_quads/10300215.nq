Bryan is best known for his involvement in the major Christian bands Newsboys and VOTA.

Bryan has been lead singer and guitarist of VOTA since its beginnings in the late 1990s. Bryan was called to perform with Inpop labelmates Newsboys when guitarist Jody Davis was unable to perform due to his daughter's illness.

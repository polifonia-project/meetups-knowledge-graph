<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doc_Gallows> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Andrew William Hankinson (born December 22, 1983) is an American professional wrestler, who is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Luke Gallows. Hankinson began his career in 2005 and participated in that year's WWE Tough Enough, a contest created by WWE to find new prospects. Despite not winning the competition, he signed a development contract and was assigned to Deep South Wrestling, WWE's farm territory. In 2006, he started a feud with Kane, where Hankinson used Kane's old attire and mask, being called Imposter Kane. They faced each other at Vengeance where Hankinson was victorious. He was repackaged as Festus, a quiet man who turns insane when the bell rings. He teamed with Jesse for almost two years before the two were split. Following this, he went on a brief hiatus from television before reappearing as Luke Gallows, the enforcer and \"disciple\" of CM Punk in the Straight Edge Society. His first run ended in 2010. After leaving WWE, he signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2011, where he became member of the villainous stable Aces & Eights under the ring name D.O.C. (Director of Chaos). He was fired in 2013 and then signed a contract with the Japanese promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) under the ring name Doc Gallows. He made his debut in the 2013 World Tag League as the partner of Karl Anderson, joining the Bullet Club faction. Gallows and Anderson won the Tag League and, during the following three years, they won the IWGP Tag Team Championship three times. Gallows and Anderson would leave NJPW for WWE along with Bullet Club leader AJ Styles in 2016. Again as Luke Gallows, Gallows and Anderson would work as a tag team and, sometimes, as a stable with Styles known as The O.C. (The Original Club). They would win the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship twice, as well as the WWE Tag Team World Cup, a one night tournament between tag teams. They were released in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, three months later, signed a contract with TNA, now called Impact Wrestling, where they won the Impact World Tag Team Championship in November." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doc_Gallows> .

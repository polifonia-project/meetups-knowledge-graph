After graduating with a degree in engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore, Jamshed briefly worked as a civilian contractor and engineer for the Pakistan Air Force before focusing on a musical career. Jamshed first gained nationwide and international recognition as the vocalist of Vital Signs. Their 1987 album, Vital Signs 1 included the hit singles \"Dil Dil Pakistan\", and \"Tum Mil Gaye\". The commercial success of the album helped develop Pakistan's rock music industry. In 1994, he released his debut solo album, Junaid of Vital Signs followed by Us Rah Par in 1999 and Dil Ki Baat in 2002. In 2004, Jamshed left both his engineering and music careers and, afterwards, focused on his religious activities for Islam and reciting nasheeds on TV and releasing them on CDs. Jamshed also owned a clothing boutique with the name \"J.\" (read as \"Jay Dot\"), which has several outlets throughout Pakistan and some abroad. In November 2014, Jamshed was accused of blasphemy and in December 2014, in a video message, he apologized for offending people and making mistakes. Junaid Jamshed and his wife died on 7 December 2016 when PIA Flight 661 crashed in Havelian. The flight was en route to Islamabad from Chitral. He was in Chitral for a Tablighi Jamaat mission and was returning to Islamabad." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Junaid_Jamshed> .

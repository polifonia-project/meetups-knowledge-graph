A legend tells that his waist was bent and his face was ugly, but he had a good heart. His family was very poor, so he begged for his mother. Though of lower-class origin, he later married King Pyeongwon of Goguryeo's daughter Princess Pyeonggang and then become a general. He died in 590 at Achasanseong Fortress during a battle against the Silla army." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/On_Dal> .

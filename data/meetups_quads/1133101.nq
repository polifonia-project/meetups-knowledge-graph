<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Blunt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Matthew Roy Blunt (born November 20, 1970) is an American former naval officer and politician who served as the 54th Governor of Missouri from 2005 to 2009. Before his election as governor, Blunt served ten years in the United States Navy, was elected to serve in the Missouri General Assembly in 1998, and as Missouri's Secretary of State in 2000. He grew up in a political family; his father, Roy Blunt, has served in a variety of political offices (including as Missouri secretary of state and congressman, and since 2011 in the U.S. Senate). A Republican, Matt Blunt was elected governor on November 2, 2004, carrying 101 of Missouri's 114 counties. At age 33, he became the second-youngest person ever elected to that office after Kit Bond. Blunt did not seek a second term as governor, announcing his decision on January 22, 2008, in an address to Missourians, which surprised many supporters and staff. After working as a consultant, Blunt was hired as the president of the American Automotive Policy Council in 2011, representing the auto lobby in Washington, D.C." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matt_Blunt> .

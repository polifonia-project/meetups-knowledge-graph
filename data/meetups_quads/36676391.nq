<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Graves_(audio_engineer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Graves (born December 23, 1968) is an American mastering engineer. He specializes in audio restoration and audio preservation. Graves is a four-time Grammy award-winner and a twelve-time Grammy nominee. He is widely considered one of the best audio engineers in his field. Country singer Hank Williams' daughter Jett praised Graves' work on her father's Grammy-winning album The Garden Spot Programs, 1950, calling it \"the best restoration Iâ€™ve ever heard before, the 1% of 1% of restoration engineering.\" Graves has worked on a wide variety of archival musical projects, working with clients from around the world. Graves' main focus is historical audio that was recorded on deteriorating or obsolete media, as well as more recent recordings on which the sound is obscured for various reasons, utilizing tools and techniques to restore the original audio. His work has often been compared to that of an archaeologist because of Graves' similarly painstaking process of cleaning and restoring old and often damaged archival material. He works with such record labels as Dust-to-Digital, Analog Africa, The Numero Group and Omnivore Recordings, which specialize in historical recordings. He has also remastered recordings for commercial release by artists such as Hank Williams, Ray Charles, Big Star, Blondie, Richard Hell, Nina Simone, Erroll Garner, Buck Owens and Bobby Rush. Graves owns and operates Osiris Studio, a Los Angeles-based mastering and audio-restoration services facility that provides audio services to the entertainment and archival communities. The studio is named after the Egyptian god of resurrection, reflecting Graves' interest in bringing recordings \"back to life.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Graves_(audio_engineer)> .

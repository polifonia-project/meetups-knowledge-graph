Derminer (December 12, 1944 â€“ September 18, 1991), known as Rob Tyner, was an American musician best known as lead singer for the Detroit proto-punk band MC5. His adopted surname was in tribute to the jazz pianist McCoy Tyner. It was Tyner who issued the rallying cry of \"kick out the jams, motherfuckers\" at the MC5's live concerts. Tyner had originally auditioned as the bass player, but the band felt his talents would be best used as a lead vocalist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rob_Tyner> .

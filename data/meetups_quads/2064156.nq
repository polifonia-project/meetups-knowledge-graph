For over 30 years, he was involved in implementing PDP, VAX, and Alpha computers with their respective operating systems RSX, VAX/VMS, OpenVMS and Windows NT. He was a respected journalist and analyst, paying particular attention to Compaq and Hewlett-Packard after the merger of Digital Equipment Corporation and the high-performance computing (HPC) space, writing a series of newsletters. He has been credited with assigning Intel Corporation the nickname \"Chipzilla\". Terry Shannon participated and was a keynote speaker at DECUS (the Digital Equipment Corporation Users Society), the international users group of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), later known as Connect, and currently HP-Interex. He also spoke as an authority at other IT and HPC conferences, and was quoted by other authors as an authority on the subject." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Terry_Shannon_(IT)> .

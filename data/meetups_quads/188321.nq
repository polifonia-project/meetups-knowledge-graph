<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hal_Hartley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hal Hartley (born November 3, 1959) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and composer who became a key figure in the American independent film movement of the 1980s and '90s. He is best known for his films The Unbelievable Truth, Trust, Simple Men, Amateur and Henry Fool, which are notable for deadpan humour and offbeat characters quoting philosophical dialogue. His films provided a career launch for a number of actors, including Adrienne Shelly, Edie Falco, James Urbaniak, Martin Donovan, Karen Sillas and Elina LÃ¶wensohn. Hartley frequently scores his own films using his pseudonym Ned Rifle, and his soundtracks regularly feature music by indie rock acts Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo and PJ Harvey." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hal_Hartley> .

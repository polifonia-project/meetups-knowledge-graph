<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Turner> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robin David Turner (born 10 September 1955) is an English former professional footballer who played as a forward. An England youth international, he began his career at Ipswich Town. After being part of the FA Youth Cup winning squad of 1973, he made his first-team debut in October 1975. Despite failing to become a first-team regular, he remained at the club until 1985 when he signed for Swansea City. He scored twice on his home debut for his new club, equalling the number of league goals that he had scored in nine seasons at Ipswich, but left later in the year to return to East Anglia when he signed for Colchester United. At the end of the 1985â€“86 season he dropped into non-League football with Bury Town." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robin_Turner> .

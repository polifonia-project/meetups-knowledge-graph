<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Nutt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James T. Nutt (born November 28, 1938) is an American artist who was a founding member of the Chicago surrealist art movement known as the Chicago Imagists, or the Hairy Who. Though his work is inspired by the same pop culture that inspired Pop Art, journalist Web Behrens says Nutt's \"paintings, particularly his later works, are more accomplished than those of the more celebrated Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.\" According to Museum of Contemporary Art curator Lynne Warren, Nutt is \"the premier artist of his generation\". Nutt attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, in Chicago, Illinois. He is married to fellow-artist and Hairy Who member Gladys Nilsson." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Nutt> .

He is the only person born in the Philippines to play Major League Baseball. Chouinard played high school baseball at Forest Grove High School in Forest Grove, Oregon. Drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the fifth round of the 1990 MLB amateur draft, Chouinard made his Major League Baseball debut with the Oakland Athletics on May 26, 1996, and appeared in his final major league game on September 9, 2001, with the Colorado Rockies. He was traded from the Orioles to the Athletics along with Allen Plaster on January 15, 1993 for Harold Baines. Chouinard was arrested on Christmas Day in 1999 following an incident in which he held a loaded gun to his wife's head and made her beg for her life. In 2000, Chouinard pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to four increments of three-month prison terms during baseball's offseasons. He was allowed 42 hours to work out at Coors Field and visit with his family every week. He was also ordered to make a $25,000 donation to a domestic violence charity and appear in ten public service announcements." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Chouinard> .

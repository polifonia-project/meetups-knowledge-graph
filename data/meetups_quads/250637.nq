She was French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard's collaborator in the 1960s, performing in several of his films, including The Little Soldier, A Woman Is a Woman, My Life to Live, Bande à part (Band of Outsiders), Pierrot le Fou (Crazy Pete) and Alphaville. For her performance in A Woman Is a Woman, Karina won the Silver Bear Award for Best Actress at the Berlin Film Festival. In 1972, Karina set up a production company for her directorial debut, Vivre ensemble (1973), which screened in the Critics' Week lineup at the 26th Cannes Film Festival. She also directed the French-Canadian film Victoria (2008). In addition to her work in cinema, she worked as a singer, and wrote several novels. Karina was an icon of 1960s cinema, and referred to as the \"effervescent free spirit of the French New Wave, with all of the scars that the position entails\". The New York Times described her as \"one of the screen's great beauties and an enduring symbol of the French New Wave.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anna_Karina> .

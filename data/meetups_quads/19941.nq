<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Bingham> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mark Kendall Bingham (May 22, 1970 â€“ September 11, 2001) was an American public relations executive who founded his own company, the Bingham Group. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, he was a passenger on board United Airlines Flight 93. Bingham was among the passengers who, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett and Jeremy Glick, formed the plan to retake the plane from the hijackers, and led the effort that resulted in the crash of the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, thwarting the hijackers' plan to crash the plane into a building in Washington, D.C., most likely either the U.S. Capitol Building or the White House. His heroic efforts on United Flight 93, as well as his athletic physique, were noted for having prompted a reassessment of gay stereotypes." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Bingham> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Moore_(comics)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Steve Moore (11 June 1949 – 16 March 2014) was a British comics writer. Moore was credited with showing writer Alan Moore (no relation), then a struggling cartoonist, how to write comic scripts. His career has subsequently been quite closely linked with the more famous Moore – the pair collaborated under pseudonyms (Steve's pseudonym was \"Pedro Henry\", Alan's was \"Curt Vile\") on strips for Sounds, including one which introduced the character Axel Pressbutton, who was later to feature in the Warrior anthology comic, as well as a standalone series published by Eclipse Comics." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Moore_(comics)> .

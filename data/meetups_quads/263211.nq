<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tipper_Gore> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Elizabeth \"Tipper\" Gore (n√©e Aitcheson; born August 19, 1948) is an American social issues advocate, activist, photographer and author who was the second lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001. She is married to Al Gore, the 45th vice president of the United States, although they separated in 2010. In 1985, Gore co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), which advocated for labeling of record covers of releases featuring profane language, especially in the heavy metal, punk, and hip hop genres of music. Throughout her decades of public life, she has advocated for placing advisory labels on music (leading critics to call her a censor), mental health awareness, women's causes, children's causes, LGBT rights, and reducing homelessness." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tipper_Gore> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Visconti> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anthony Edward Visconti (born April 24, 1944) is an American record producer, musician and singer. Since the late 1960s, he has worked with an array of performers. His first hit single was T. Rex's \"Ride a White Swan\" in 1970, the first of many hits in collaboration with Marc Bolan. Visconti's lengthiest involvement was with David Bowie: intermittently from the production and arrangement of Bowie's 1968 single \"In the Heat of the Morning\" / \"London Bye Ta-Ta\" to his final album Blackstar in 2016, Visconti produced and occasionally performed on many of Bowie's albums. Visconti's work on Blackstar was cited in its Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical and his production of Angelique Kidjo's Djin Djin was cited in its Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tony_Visconti> .

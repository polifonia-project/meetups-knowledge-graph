Chippindale reported on the Birmingham Six trial and that of the Guildford Four and \"he thought they'd got the wrong men in both cases\". His suspicions convinced Chris Mullin to investigate and led eventually to their acquittal. In 1981 he worked on documentaries for London Weekend Television's The London Programme. He was news editor for the left wing News on Sunday and charted its demise with fellow ex-employee Chris Horrie in their book Disaster: The Rise and Fall of News on Sunday.

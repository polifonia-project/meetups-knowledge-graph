He was known as one of the booming voices behind Kellogg's Frosted Flakes animated spokesman Tony the Tiger for more than five decades. He was also the uncredited vocalist for the song \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\" from the classic Christmas television special, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! Ravenscroft did some voice-over work and singing for Disney in both the films and the attractions at Disneyland (which were later featured at Walt Disney World). The best known of these attractions are Haunted Mansion as a singing bust, Country Bear Jamboree, Mark Twain Riverboat, Pirates of the Caribbean, Disneyland Railroad, and Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room as \"Fritz\". His voice acting career began in 1940 and lasted until his death in 2005 at age 91." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thurl_Ravenscroft> .

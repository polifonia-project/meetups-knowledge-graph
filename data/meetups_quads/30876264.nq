She appeared in the television role of Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and as Carol Foster Lambert on Step by Step. Somers later became the author of a series of self-help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006), about bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Somers has been criticized for her views on some medical subjects and her advocacy of the Wiley Protocol, which has been labelled as \"scientifically unproven and dangerous\". Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suzanne_Somers> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Hanson_(American_football)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Christopher David Hanson (born October 25, 1976) is a former American football punter who played ten seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Marshall University, and was signed by the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent in 1999. He also played professionally for the Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Jacksonville Jaguars, New Orleans Saints and New England Patriots. Hanson is perhaps best known for a season-ending injury sustained while swinging a motivational axe in the Jaguars' locker room in 2003. Hanson was a switch-punter, able to effectively kick with both his left and his right leg, which he alternated to reduce fatigue." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Hanson_(American_football)> .

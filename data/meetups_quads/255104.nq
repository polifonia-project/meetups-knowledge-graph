<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Spungen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nancy Laura Spungen (/ˈspʌŋɡən/; February 27, 1958 – October 12, 1978) was the American girlfriend of English musician Sid Vicious, and a figure of the 1970s punk rock scene. Raised Jewish in Philadelphia, Spungen was an emotionally disturbed child who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 15. After being expelled from college, she flew to London in December 1976 at the height of the punk rock movement and became involved with Vicious, the bass player of the Sex Pistols. Their relationship was punctuated by bouts of domestic violence and drug abuse. The press soon labelled Spungen \"Nauseating Nancy\" for her outrageous and frequently antisocial behavior. After John Lydon left the band and Vicious was made the new front man, the couple moved to New York City and checked into the Hotel Chelsea, where they spent much of their time using drugs, especially heroin. In October 1978, Spungen was found dead in the bathroom of the couple's room, with a single stab wound to the abdomen. Vicious was charged with her murder, but died of a heroin overdose while on bail in February 1979 before the case went to trial. Various authors and filmmakers have speculated about Vicious' role in Spungen's death and the possibility that Spungen was killed by a drug dealer who frequently visited their room." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nancy_Spungen> .

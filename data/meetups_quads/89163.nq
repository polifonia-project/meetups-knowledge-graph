<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_A._Wheeler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Almon Wheeler (June 30, 1819 â€“ June 4, 1887) was an American politician and attorney. He served as a United States representative from New York from 1861 to 1863 and 1869 to 1877, and the 19th vice president of the United States from 1877 to 1881. Born in Malone, New York, Wheeler pursued a legal career after attending the University of Vermont. After serving in various local positions, he won election to the New York State Legislature. He served in Congress from 1861 to 1863 and from 1869 to 1877. He was widely respected for his integrity, and refused his salary increase after Congress passed an 1873 pay raise that he opposed. After the 1876 Republican National Convention settled on Rutherford B. Hayes as the party's presidential nominee after seven ballots, the delegates nominated Wheeler for vice president. Nominated by Congressman Luke P. Poland, Wheeler surged into an early lead over Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, Marshall Jewell, and Stewart L. Woodford to clinch the nomination on the first ballot. Wheeler was nominated because he was popular among his colleagues, having worked to avoid making enemies in Congress. In addition, as a resident of the populous Eastern state of New York, he provided geographical balance to the ticket, since Hayes was from the populous Midwest state of Ohio. The Republican ticket prevailed in the contentious 1876 presidential election, though they lost the popular vote. Though they had not known each other before the convention, Wheeler and Hayes got along amicably while in office. They chose not to seek second terms, and Wheeler returned to Malone, New York, after the end of his term. He died in 1887, and was buried at Morningside Cemetery in Malone. Wheeler's pursuit of an alliance between Republicans and Old Southern Whigs, which involved an abandonment of the Republican Party's commitment to ensuring civil rights and social equality, doomed Southern blacks to the hands of Democratic white supremacists, who enacted Jim Crow laws that lasted for decades." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_A._Wheeler> .

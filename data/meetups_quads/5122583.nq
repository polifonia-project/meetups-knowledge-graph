<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Vincent_(British_Army_officer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "General John Vincent (1764â€“1848) was the British commanding officer of the Niagara Peninsula in Upper Canada when the United States attacked in the spring of 1813. He was defeated at the Battle of Fort George but was able to rebound and establish the new lines at Burlington Heights. He directed the campaign during the summer and fall that eventually forced the Americans to abandon the Niagara area in December 1813, thanks in large part due to his victory over the Americans at the Battle of Stoney Creek. Due to illness he was replaced by General Phineas Riall, though of the several officers of the 49th Regiment who reached high command during the War of 1812, Vincent was the longest-serving of them. British and Canadian accounts of the War give the impression of a modest, well-liked and generous officer, who gave whatever help he could to other commanders. From 1814, he had held the sinecure post of Lieutenant-Governor of Dumbarton Castle." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Vincent_(British_Army_officer)> .

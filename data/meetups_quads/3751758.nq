A leg-spinning all-rounder, he played in 24 Test matches and 95 One Day Internationals for Zimbabwe between 1994 and 2001. He played Test cricket alongside his brother, Bryan Strang; their father, Ronald Strang, was a first-class umpire and was TV umpire for two of Zimbabwe's Test matches in 1994/5. Strang has since moved into coaching, joining the Auckland Aces as a high performance coach in 2008, and becoming the full-time coach soon afterwards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Strang> .

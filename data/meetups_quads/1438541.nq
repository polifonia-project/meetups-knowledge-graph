<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Le_Caine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hugh Le Caine (May 27, 1914 â€“ July 3, 1977) was a Canadian physicist, composer, and instrument builder. Le Caine was brought up in Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay) in northwestern Ontario. At a young age, he began making musical instruments. In youth, he started imagining \"beautiful sounds\". He attended high school in Port Arthur at Port Arthur Collegiate Institute (P.A.C.I.). After completing his master of science degree from Queen's University in 1939, Le Caine was awarded a National Research Council of Canada (NRC) fellowship to continue his work on atomic physics measuring devices at Queen's. He worked with the NRC in Ottawa from 1940 to 1974. During World War II, he assisted in the development of the first radar systems. On an NRC grant he studied nuclear physics from 1948 to 1952 in England. Le Caine wanted to devise new ways to produce those \"beautiful sounds\", so he established his own electronic music studio where he began to build new electronic instruments after World War II." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Le_Caine> .

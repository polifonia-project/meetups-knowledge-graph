He was billed as the last of the Piedmont blues musicians. Hanks recorded two albums in his lifetime, Pickin' Low Cotton (2007) and Buffalo Junction (2012), both released by the Music Maker record label. A one-time farmer, who grew up in and lived most of his adult life around Buffalo Junction, Virginia, Hanks appeared at the Roots of American Music Festival at the Lincoln Center, shared a bill with Patti Smith, was covered by The New York Times, and performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival; plus he toured in both the US and Europe." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boo_Hanks> .

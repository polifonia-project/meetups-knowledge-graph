He used it for research and education about alligators, crocodiles and snakes, also sponsoring and conducting collection expeditions. Allen founded and was first president of the International Crocodile Society. In his research with snakes, he developed many anti-venoms, including a dried form, and professionally milked venoms for venomous snakes, which was particularly important for protecting United States forces during World War II. He mixed entertainment and science at his Institute." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ross_Allen_(herpetologist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hubert_Wilkins> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir George Hubert Wilkins MC & Bar (31 October 1888 â€“ 30 November 1958), commonly referred to as Captain Wilkins, was an Australian polar explorer, ornithologist, pilot, soldier, geographer and photographer. He was awarded the Military Cross after he assumed command of a group of American soldiers who had lost their officers during the Battle of the Hindenburg Line, and became the only official Australian photographer from any war to receive a combat medal. He narrowly failed in an attempt to be the first to cross under the North Pole in a submarine, but was able to prove that submarines were capable of operating beneath the polar ice cap, thereby paving the way for future successful missions. The US Navy later took his ashes to the North Pole aboard the submarine USS Skate on 17 March 1959." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hubert_Wilkins> .

He is known for his appearances with professional wrestling promotions including Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Widely recognized as \"one of the best talkers in wrestling\", Raven is known for his \"psychological heel tactics\" and grunge-inspired gimmick. His feud with The Sandman in the mid-1990s has been described as \"one of the most emotional rivalries in professional wrestling's history\". He is one of the most decorated wrestlers in history, with 37 title reigns between WWE, WCW, ECW, and TNA, including being a three-time World Champion and having a record 27 reigns as WWF/E Hardcore Champion.

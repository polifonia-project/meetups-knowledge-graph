At the 1982 Commonwealth Games, he placed 7th in the 400m and 4th as a member of Canada's 4 × 400 metres relay. He was a member of Canada's 4 × 400 metres relay at the 1984 Summer Olympics, which placed 8th. After he retired, Bethune admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs at the Dubin Inquiry in 1989. He was never found to have taken any performance-enhancing drugs while competing, and he was exonerated from any allegations that he competed while using any performance-enhancing drugs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tim_Bethune> .

He debuted in 1980, releasing his first album, Spring Summer Fall Winter, along with his band of the same name. He died at the age of 32 from cirrhosis. He is recognized as one of the most popular and notable musicians of the 1980s in Korea, well known for his unique, husky, emotional vocal style. Kim released five albums while alive, with his sixth album—Kim Hyun-sik VI, popularly known by the title of its lead single, \"My Love By My Side\"—being released posthumously. Kim broke out of the hospital to finish the vocal recordings for his last album, showing his dedication to his profession. He won the Disc Daesang (Album of the Year) award at the 1991 Golden Disc Awards, the Korean approximation of the Grammy Awards, for his posthumous sixth album, Kim Hyun-sik VI. Kim was also honored by having three episodes of the popular singing competition show Immortal Songs 2 dedicated to his music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kim_Hyun-sik> .

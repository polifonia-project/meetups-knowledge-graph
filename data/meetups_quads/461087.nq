<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edna_O'Brien> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Josephine Edna O'Brien DBE (born 15 December 1930) is an Irish novelist, memoirist, playwright, poet and short-story writer. Elected to Aosd√°na by her fellow artists, she was honoured with the title Saoi in 2015 and the biennial \"UK and Ireland Nobel\" David Cohen Prize in 2019, whilst France made her Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2021. O'Brien's works often revolve around the inner feelings of women, and their problems in relating to men, and to society as a whole. Her first novel, The Country Girls (1960), is often credited with breaking silence on sexual matters and social issues during a repressive period in Ireland following the Second World War. The book was banned, burned and denounced from the pulpit. Faber and Faber published her memoir, Country Girl, in 2012. O'Brien lives in London. O'Brien has been mentioned as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in literature. Philip Roth described her as \"the most gifted woman now writing in English\", while a former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, cited her as \"one of the great creative writers of her generation\". Others to hail her as one of the greatest writers alive include John Banville, Michael Ondaatje and Sir Ian McKellen. O'Brien received the Irish PEN Award in 2001. Saints and Sinners won the 2011 Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award, the world's richest prize for a short-story collection." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edna_O'Brien> .

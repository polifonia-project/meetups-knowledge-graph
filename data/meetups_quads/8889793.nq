<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allan_Havis> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Allan Havis is an American playwright whose work has pronounced political themes and probes colliding cultures. His works range from minimal-language texts to ambiguous, ironic narratives that delineate the genesis, paradoxes, and seduction of evil. Several of his dramas involve Jewish identity, cultural alienation, and universal problems of racism. He has been influenced by August Strindberg and Harold Pinter . In addition, Havis has written librettos for four operas produced in the early 21st century. He has authored two young adult novels, one adult novel, and a popular book on cult films. Since 2001, he has edited and published three anthologies of plays, selected to express the changing political landscape in the United States in the era of terrorism. He is a professor of playwriting at the University of California, San Diego." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allan_Havis> .

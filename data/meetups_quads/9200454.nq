<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harrod_Blank> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Harrod Blank (born 1963, in Westminster, California, United States) is an American documentary filmmaker and art car artist living at Berkeley in California. He is the son of Gail, a ceramic artist, and filmmaker Les Blank. His works include the 1992 film Wild Wheels, which documents the artcar phenomenon in America, and the 1998 follow-up Driving The Dream, which focuses on the artists behind the cars. His films have been shown on PBS, TBS, and in cities all over the USA. Harrod has created three art cars of his own: Oh My God!, Pico de Gallo and The Camera Van. Blank is also the co-founder (along with Philo Northrup) of one of the largest annual art car gatherings in the country - the Art Car Fest, held every September in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is largely responsible for the organization of an art car theme camp at the annual Burning Man festival and is working on a documentary about the event. Blank is currently renovating a building complex in Douglas, Arizona, United States, to become a museum and learning center for art cars; the name of the center will be \"Artcar World\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harrod_Blank> .

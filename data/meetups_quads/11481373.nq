<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ted_DiBiase_Jr.> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Theodore Marvin DiBiase Jr. (born November 8, 1982) is an American former professional wrestler, best known for his time with WWE as an original member of the stable The Legacy, and for his repackaged gimmick of \"The DiBiase Posse\", where he threw tailgating parties before, during, and after WWE shows. Part of the DiBiase wrestling family, he was trained by Chris Youngblood and Harley Race's Wrestling Academy and debuted in 2006. He won the Fusion Pro Tag Team Championship with his brother Mike DiBiase in February 2007, and also toured Japan with Pro Wrestling Noah. He signed a developmental contract with WWE in July 2007, and was assigned to their developmental facility, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he won the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship in December 2007. Due to injury, he relinquished the championship in January 2008. He made his WWE television debut on May 26, 2008, and quickly formed a tag team with Cody Rhodes. The duo won the World Tag Team Championship twice before forming The Legacy faction alongside Randy Orton. Following The Legacy's dissolution, DiBiase moved into singles competition and received the Million Dollar Championship from his father Ted DiBiase. DiBiase left WWE in 2013 due to family commitments and other business pursuits. He continued to wrestle on the independent circuit until his retirement in 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ted_DiBiase_Jr.> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Little_Miss_Cornshucks> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Little Miss Cornshucks (or Lil' Miss Cornshucks) was the stage name of Mildred Jorman (born Mildred Elizabeth Cummings; May 26, 1923 â€“ November 11, 1999). She was an American rhythm and blues and jazz singer and songwriter. In her stage show from the 1940s and early 1950s she portrayed herself as a simple farm girl. Her vocal style inspired later R&B and soul singers, among them LaVern Baker, Ruth Brown, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Wynona Carr and Billy Wright. Her own career never achieved full recognition in her lifetime." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Little_Miss_Cornshucks> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kumi_Tanioka> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kumi Tanioka (谷岡 久美, Tanioka Kumi, born August 29, 1974) is a Japanese composer and pianist. Born in Hiroshima, Japan, she graduated from Kobe University with a degree in musical performance, and began working as a video game composer in 1998. She joined video game developer and publisher Square that same year, and worked on over 15 games for them before leaving to work as an independent composer in 2010. Tanioka is best known for composing for the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series. Tanioka has a style of \"world music\", whereby she combines instruments from different parts of the world into one cohesive sound. She also likes to incorporate piano music into her soundtracks, which she typically performs herself, as she has done as a part of The Star Onions, a musical group focusing on arrangements of Final Fantasy XI music as well at various concerts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kumi_Tanioka> .

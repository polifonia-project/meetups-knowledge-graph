<http://dbpedia.org/resource/MeeK> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephane-Franck Pascal (born 16 February 1971), known professionally as MeeK, is a French-British singer, songwriter, musician and music producer. His stage name (always spelled with a capital \"M\" and a capital \"K\") is a homage to 1960s British pop producer Joe Meek.A multi-instrumentalist, MeeK plays all the instruments on his recordings through a multitracked/multi-layered method of recording and provides all vocals including multi-layered backing harmonies. Since his first album in 2002 and an ever strong presence on the Internet right from its very early days as a mass media, MeeK is part of the European pop/rock Indie music scene. Over the years and through word-of-mouth, some have come to consider him a \"cult-artist\" because of his ever dedicated worldwide fanbase, his rather non-typical and enigmatic persona and the fact that he is one of the first few artists in Europe who have pioneered in utilising the Internet as a marketing tool and a medium to publicise and/or expose their music to the general public in the late-1990s, long before the advent of social networks like MySpace, Facebook or YouTube." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/MeeK> .

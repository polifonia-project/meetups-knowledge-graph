<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dana_Hall_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dana Hall (born March 13, 1969) is an American jazz drummer, percussionist, composer, bandleader, and ethnomusicologist. After spending the first few years of his life in Brooklyn, New York (his birthplace), he relocated with his family to his mother's hometown of Philadelphia. There, Hall was exposed to jazz and soul music at an early age through the recordings of his mother Diane, his uncle Earl Harris, and his large extended family. His family's interest in creative music, and their “open door” policy toward Philadelphia jazz musicians of the era sparked Hall's curiosity, passion and ultimately career in music." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dana_Hall_(musician)> .

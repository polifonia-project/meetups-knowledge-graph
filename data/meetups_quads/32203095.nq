He appeared with Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames and Manfred Mann in the mid-1960s, and then with Soft Machine and Keef Hartley, as well as playing on albums by Nick Drake and John Martyn. Dobson played the flute solo on Manfred Mann's \"Pretty Flamingo\". Dobson also played on a number of sessions for The Small Faces, including their Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake LP, and the track \"The Autumn Stone\" (released after the group split in 1969), and he performed live with them during 1968. He also subsequently guested on Humble Pie's debut album As Safe As Yesterday Is (1969), on which he also played sitar. He released an album, Jam Sandwich, on Fresh Air Records in 1974. After the 1970s, he worked in theatre, dance, drama, multimedia, music teaching and music therapy. In the 1990s, Dobson recorded two albums with the Third Ear Band." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lyn_Dobson> .

He is a vegan and straight edge. Dan uses Spector NS-5XL basses with D'Addario EXL160-5 nickel wound strings, a Fender-reissued Sunn 300T amp and an Ampeg SVT-810E.Dan states that he chose a Spector bass over other basses because he got it at the age of 16 and it was the \"nicest bass in my price range.\" The Spector Bass has stock EMGs and is tuned in C# Standard. Regarding guitar playing, Briggs has stated, \"I never use the pick as I learned with my fingers.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Briggs_(musician)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Kemp> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Earl Kemp (November 24, 1929 â€“ February 29, 2020) (Born Finis Earl Kemp.) was an American publisher, science fiction editor, critic, and fan who won a Hugo Award for Best Fanzine in 1961 for Who Killed Science Fiction, a collection of questions and answers with top writers in the field. Kemp also helped found Advent:Publishers, a small publishing house focused on science fiction criticism, history, and bibliography, and served as chairman of the 20th World Science Fiction Convention. During the 1960s and '70s, Kemp was also involved in publishing a number of erotic paperbacks, including an illustrated edition of the Presidential Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. This publication led to Kemp being sentenced to one year in prison for \"conspiracy to mail obscene material,\" but he served only the federal minimum of three months and one day." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Kemp> .

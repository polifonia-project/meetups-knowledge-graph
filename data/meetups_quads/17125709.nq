<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarabjit_Singh> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sarabjit Singh Attwal (also spelled Sarabjeet Singh; 1963 or 1964 â€“ 2 May 2013) (alleged to be Manjit Singh Rattu by Pakistan) was an Indian national convicted of terrorism and spying by a Pakistani court. He was tried and convicted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan for a series of bomb attacks in Lahore and Faisalabad that killed 14 bystanders in 1990. However, according to India, Sarabjit was a farmer who strayed into Pakistan from his village located on the border, three months after the bombings. After a brief trial in the Lahore High Court (later directed to the Supreme Court), he was condemned and sentenced to death in 1991, but the sentence was repeatedly postponed by the Government of Pakistan. While in prison at Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore in April 2013, he was attacked by fellow inmates and died six days later at the Jinnah Hospital, Lahore." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarabjit_Singh> .

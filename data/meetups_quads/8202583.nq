<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_David_Brohn> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William David \"Bill\" Brohn (March 30, 1933 â€“ May 11, 2017) was an American arranger and orchestrator, best known for his scores of musicals such as Miss Saigon, Ragtime and Wicked. He won the Tony Award for Best Orchestrations for Ragtime and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Orchestrations three times. His work was eclectic, orchestrating many different styles of music. His modern scores are known for their keyboard writing for the orchestra pit, and their balance between acoustic and synthesised sounds. Brohn was one of the few theatre orchestrators to use the E-bow attachment to the electric guitar, which can be heard in his orchestrations for Wicked and Mary Poppins." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_David_Brohn> .

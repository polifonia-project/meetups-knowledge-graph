Aldis made his debut on the British independent circuit in 2004 before signing with his first major wrestling company Total Nonstop Action (TNA) in 2008. During his seven-year tenure there, he won the TNA World Heavyweight Championship once becoming the first British-born world champion in TNA history along with becoming a three-time tag team champion TNA World Tag Team Championship twice and the IWGP Tag Team Championship once. At Ring Ka King he won the RKK World Heavyweight Championship in 2011. Immediately after leaving TNA in 2015, Aldis signed with Jeff Jarrettâ€™s new promotion Global Force Wrestling. Aldis would win a tournament to become the inaugural GFW Global Champion. Aldis would be the longest reigning champion in the title's history. In 2017, Aldis briefly returned to TNA now Impact Wrestling due to their new partnership with GFW, dropping the title and leaving the company later that year. In late 2017, Nick Aldis signed with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), under the new management run by Billy Corgan and would soon win the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship, a title he would win twice, becoming the second British-born wrestler to hold that championship (after Gary Steele).

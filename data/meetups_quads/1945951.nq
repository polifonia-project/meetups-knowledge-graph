<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonia_Delaunay> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sonia Delaunay (13 November 1885 â€“ 5 December 1979) was a Ukrainian-French artist, who spent most of her working life in Paris. She was born in Odessa (Ukraine, then part of Russian Empire), and formally trained in Russian Empire and Germany before moving to France and expanding her practice to include textile, fashion, and set design. She co-founded the Orphism art movement, noted for its use of strong colours and geometric shapes, with her husband Robert Delaunay and others. She was the first living female artist to have a retrospective exhibition at the Louvre in 1964, and in 1975 was named an officer of the French Legion of Honor. Her work in modern design included the concepts of geometric abstraction, and the integration of furniture, fabrics, wall coverings, and clothing into her art practice." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonia_Delaunay> .

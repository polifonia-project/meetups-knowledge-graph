<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Clarke_(politician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kevin Mark Clarke (born March 21, 1964) is a Canadian former educator, activist and perennial candidate who is the founder and former leader of The People's Political Party. He is considered one of the most recognizable homeless persons in the city of Toronto, campaigning on \"the people's rights.\" Clarke advocates for comprehensive reform in the criminal justice system, to create a system that prevents recidivism among first-time offenders. He has proposed a program that he claims would reduce the recidivism which allegedly violent prison environments create: 'The Inmate Monitored Education System' otherwise known as T.I.M.E., which would aim to help eliminate the claimed harmful influence of prison life on first-time offenders. He also campaigns strongly on the issues of poverty and homelessness. A former student teacher for Grade 5 at Chester Le Junior Public School in Scarborough in the 1980s, Clarke credits that period in his life as his most rewarding experience." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Clarke_(politician)> .

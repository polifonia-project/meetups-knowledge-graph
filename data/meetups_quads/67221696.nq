<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Jackson_(blues_musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Warren George Harding Lee (August 18, 1921 â€“ July 1, 1979), known professionally as Lee Jackson, was an American Chicago blues guitarist, bass guitarist, singer and songwriter. Although he did release a number of recordings in his own name, such as Lonely Girl (1974), he is most known for his work on recordings with other blues musicians such as Johnny Shines, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Reed, J. B. Hutto, Sunnyland Slim, Lacy Gibson, and Little Walter. AllMusic noted that \"the playing style of Jackson is vastly influential\". Jackson was fatally shot during a family argument in 1979." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Jackson_(blues_musician)> .

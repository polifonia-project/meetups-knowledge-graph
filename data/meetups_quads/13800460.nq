<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xavier_Woods> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Austin Watson (born September 4, 1986) is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Xavier Woods. Watson also makes public appearances outside of wrestling under the name Austin Creed. Watson previously worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Consequences Creed, and was a one-time TNA World Tag Team Champion with Jay Lethal as The Lethal Consequences. After signing with WWE in 2010, he was assigned to its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) under the ring name Xavier Woods. FCW was later rebranded into NXT, where Woods worked until he was called up to the main roster in 2013. In 2014, Woods formed The New Day alongside Big E and Kofi Kingston, and has since become a record seven-time SmackDown Tag Team Champion and four-time Raw Tag Team Champion, making him an overall 11-time tag team champion in WWE. New Day's second reign with the Raw Tag Team Championship was the longest tag team title reign of any male tag team championship in WWE history until that record was broken in February 2021. In October 2021, Woods became the 22nd winner of the King of the Ring tournament and briefly went by the name of King Woods. Since 2015, Watson, as Austin Creed, has hosted a gaming YouTube channel titled UpUpDownDown, where he invites fellow WWE performers, gaming personalities, friends, and guests to play games. He is also a host on the G4 television network, which covers video games, following its revival in 2020, until its end in 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xavier_Woods> .

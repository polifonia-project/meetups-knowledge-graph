<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damon_Harris> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Otis Robert \"Damon\" Harris Jr. (July 17, 1950 â€“ February 18, 2013) was an American soul and R&B singer, most notable as a member of The Temptations from 1971 to 1975. Twenty years old when he joined the group, Harris was the youngest member of The Temptations during his tenure in the group. As a teenager Harris had formed a Temptations tribute band named The Young Tempts (a.k.a. The Young Vandals). The group had charted singles released on T-Neck Records, and later had a few minor hits under the name Impact. He also was instrumental in his former singing group partner, Billy Griffin, getting the opportunity to replace Smokey Robinson in The Miracles. Harris later founded, and became the CEO of, The Damon Harris Cancer Foundation dedicated to promoting the awareness, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Damon_Harris> .

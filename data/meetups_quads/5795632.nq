<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugo_Gellert> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hugo Gellert (born Hugó Grünbaum, May 3, 1892 – December 9, 1985) was a Hungarian-American illustrator and muralist. A committed radical and member of the Communist Party of America, Gellert created much work for political activism in the 1920s and 1930s. It was distinctive in style, considered by some art critics as among the best political work of the first half of the 20th century. His family immigrated to New York in 1906. Gellert studied in art schools in New York. His illustrations were first published in radical Hungarian and American magazines, but in the 1920s Gellert worked as a staff artist for The New Yorker magazine and The New York Times newspaper. Although he was opposed to United States' entry into World War I, when conditions were worsening in Europe in 1939 after the rise of Nazi Germany, Gellert helped organize \"Artists for Defense\"; he later became chairman of \"Artists for Victory\", which included over 10,000 members." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugo_Gellert> .

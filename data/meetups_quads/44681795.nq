He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Baron Corbin. Pestock is a former offensive lineman for the Indianapolis Colts and Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL), as well as a three-time Golden Gloves champion and former grappling champion. Pestock signed with WWE in 2012 and was assigned to their developmental brand NXT as Baron Corbin. He debuted on the main roster at WrestleMania 32, winning the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. He went on to win the 2017 Money in the Bank men's ladder match and WWE United States Championship once. In 2018, he was made the Constable of Raw and started a feud with Kurt Angle which culminated at WrestleMania 35, with Corbin defeating him in his retirement match. A few months later, he won the 2019 King of the Ring tournament, thus changing his ring name to King Corbin until June 2021, where he lost his crown and subsequently became destitute. However in August 2021, he adopted the new ring name \"Happy Corbin\" and gimmick, portraying a happy go-lucky wealthy character. He then started a brief alliance with Madcap Moss. Since October 2022, he reverted back to the \"Baron Corbin\" ring name and has been managed by JBL." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baron_Corbin> .

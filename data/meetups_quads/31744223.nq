His obituary in The Augusta Chronicle stated that had been a child prodigy in music.

Beginning 1966, Fominaya served as chair of the Fine Arts Department at Augusta State University for 16 years. In total, Fominaya served 33 years at Augusta State University, teaching violin, composition, contemporary harmony/humanities and counterpoint. He retired as a Professor of Music at age 70.

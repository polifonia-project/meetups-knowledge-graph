<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karen_Alexander_(fashion_model)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Karen Alexander (born circa 1965 in New Jersey) is an American fashion model and actress, most known for her modeling career. She is 5'10\" with dark brown hair and eyes. She began her career when she was sixteen years old, visiting multiple modeling agencies in New York. She tried to sign with Eileen Ford, John Casablancas, and Bethann Hardison, but was seen as \"unphotogenic,\" not \"commercial\" enough, or too \"commercial\" by each of them respectively. It wasn't until she came across Legends Agency that she was finally signed and could begin her career. Alexander would go on to become a muse to fashion's top designers and magazine editors, and create a name for herself for at least two decades. Legends Agency is now non-existent and Alexander was represented by IMG until 2019 she was diagnosed with Dermatomyositis an incurable neuromuscular disease." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karen_Alexander_(fashion_model)> .

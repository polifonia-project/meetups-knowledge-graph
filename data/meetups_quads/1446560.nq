<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Glazer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jonathan Glazer (born 26 March 1965) is an English film director and screenwriter. Born in London, Glazer began his career in theatre before transitioning into film. Over the course of a career spanning nearly three decades, Glazer's directing work includes feature films, short films, music videos, and commercials. Glazer has been nominated for two BAFTA Awards and twice for both the Golden Lion and the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. He also received the nomination for the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction twice, consecutively for his work on Jamiroquai's \"Virtual Insanity\" and Radiohead's \"Karma Police\". His work is often characterized by depictions of flawed and desperate characters, explorations of themes such as alienation and loneliness, a bold visual style that utilizes an omniscient perspective, and dramatic use of music. His 2013 film Under the Skin received numerous accolades and awards and was included in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_Glazer> .

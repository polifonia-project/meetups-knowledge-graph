<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Sur> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Donald Young Sur (1 February 1935 â€“ 24 May 1999) was a Korean American composer and musicologist. Although he is best known for his large-scale oratorio, Slavery Documents, most of his works were composed for small chamber ensembles. Sur was born in Honolulu and moved with his family to Los Angeles after World War II. He studied at the University of California and Princeton before spending four years in Korea researching ancient Korean court music. After receiving his doctorate from Harvard in 1972, he settled in Boston, Massachusetts, where many of his works were premiered and where he taught at several local universities, including Harvard, MIT, and Tufts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Sur> .

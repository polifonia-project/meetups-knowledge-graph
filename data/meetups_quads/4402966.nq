His books include Uncommon Places (1982) and American Surfaces (1999), photographs that he took on cross-country road trips in the 1970s. In 1975 Shore received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1971, he was the first living photographer to be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, where he had a solo show of black and white photographs. He was selected to participate in the influential group exhibition \"New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape\", at the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House (Rochester, New York), in 1975-1976. In 1976 he had a solo exhibition of color photographs at the Museum of Modern Art. In 2010 he received an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal Photographic Society." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Shore> .

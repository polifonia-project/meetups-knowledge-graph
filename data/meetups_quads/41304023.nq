He penned some memorable songs such as the famous nazm Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo and Tasveer teri dil mera behela nah sakegi. The latter made the singer Talat Mahmood famous in India back in 1944 and was instrumental in introducing him to the Calcutta film industry. A little known fact about him is that he wrote the famous 'Na tum mere na dil mera', that was sung by Kamla Jharia, among many others. One of the couplets from this ghazal became popular that reads: 'aye bas naadaniyon par apni naaz karte hain,abhi dekhi kahan hain aapne naadaniyan meri' and then \"Yeh Raatein, Yeh Mausam, Yeh Hansana Hansaana, Mujhe Bhool Jana, Inhein Na Bhulana\" sung by Pankaj Mullick (a non-film song)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fayyaz_Hashmi> .

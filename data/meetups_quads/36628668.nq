In praising Pintado’s work, United States' Presidential Inaugural poet Richard Blanco has written: “The urgency and presence in Pintado’s poems feel as if the poet’s very life depended on writing them. They are possessed by a unique, intangible quality that arrests the reader and commands attention. His work is intimate yet boundless, moving easily between form and free verse, prose poems and long poems, whether capturing the everyday streets of Miami Beach or leading us into the mythic and mystical worlds of his imagination.” In 2012, Carlos Pintado was one the judges of Gibara's Film Festival, along with Spanish singer and film maker Luis Eduardo Aute." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlos_Pintado> .

Born in Wrightsville, Georgia, Cook attended the public schools and received his undergraduate degree from Mercer University, followed by a law degree from Mercer University Law School in 1927. He was the Attorney General of Georgia from 1945 to 1965, and a justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. He believed the NAACP was a communist organization. Despondent in the months following the death of his wife, Cook died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound while still serving on the court." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eugene_Cook_(Georgia_judge)> .

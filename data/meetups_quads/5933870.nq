<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddie_Thomas_(boxer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edward Thomas MBE (27 July 1925 â€“ 2 June 1997) was a Welsh professional boxer and boxing manager. He was born in Merthyr Tydfil. After a highly successful amateur boxing career, he turned professional in 1946. He won the Welsh welterweight title in 1948 and the British welterweight title in 1949, becoming the first Welsh fighter to hold the belt for more than 30 years. He won the European welterweight title in 1951, retaining it for only four months. He held the British Empire title for a period in the same year. Retiring in 1954, he became the manager of two of Britain's most successful boxing champions, Howard Winstone and Ken Buchanan, both of whom won world titles in their weight classes. He later served as mayor of Merthyr Tydfil." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddie_Thomas_(boxer)> .

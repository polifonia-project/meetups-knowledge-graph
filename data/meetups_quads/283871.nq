<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manute_Bol> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Manute Bol (/məˈnuːt ˈboʊl/; October 16, 1962 – June 19, 2010) was a Sudanese-American professional basketball player and political activist. Listed at 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m) or 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) tall, Bol was tied with Gheorghe Mureșan as the tallest player in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After he played college basketball for the Bridgeport Purple Knights, Bol was selected by the Washington Bullets in the 1985 NBA draft. Bol played for the Bullets and three other teams over the course of his NBA career, which lasted from 1985 to 1995. A center, Bol is considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport and is the only NBA player to retire with more career blocked shots than points scored. As of 2020, he ranked second in NBA history in blocked shots per game and 16th in total blocked shots. Bol was notable for his efforts to promote human rights in his native Sudan and aid for Sudanese refugees." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manute_Bol> .

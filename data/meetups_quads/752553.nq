He is known for his two-year marriage to American singer Britney Spears and the child custody battle that followed, which earned significant media coverage. His popularity led to him releasing his critically-panned debut album Playing with Fire in 2006. He has since made a number of television appearances, and starred in music videos until 2008." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kevin_Federline> .

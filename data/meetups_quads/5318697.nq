Zhang has released ten studio albums as of 2020. She debuted and rose to fame with the Taiwanese television dramas My MVP Valentine (2002) and At Dolphin Bay (2003), although since 2004, when her debut album Over the Rainbow met with instant success, she has focused on her singing career. Aurora (2004) and Pandora (2006) sold millions in Asia, while another TV series that she starred in, Romantic Princess (2007), also became an international hit. In 2008–09, she withdrew from the public eye for nearly a year and a half when her mother accused her of being unfilial and unsupportive. Zhang, in turn, claimed that her mother had squandered more than NT$100 million of her income. The media's relentless coverage of her family problems, exacerbated by Zhang's falling-out with her employer Linfair Records, accusing her of not doing enough to protect her which significantly derailed her career for many years. Zhang later returned after a few year hiatus when she compete in Hunan's reality singing competition Singer 2018, the seventh season of I Am a Singer where she served as a host and contestant. Having moved her career to mainland China, her 2019 album , under a new label, was the 56th best-selling album in China in 2019. Zhang's maternal grandfather was an ethnic Uyghur, with the rest of her family Hakka. She grew up in Taiwan and Canada." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angela_Zhang> .

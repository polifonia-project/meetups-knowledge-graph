Mac Mall signed with the record label, Young Black Brotha Records, and later came to own the label, for the production of his own albums, and those of associates. One of Mac Mall's first singles was a song called \"Ghetto Theme\", which had a music video directed by Tupac Shakur in 1993. He was also longtime friends with Mac Dre, who was his mentor early on in his career. He is also cousins to E-40, B-Legit and Sway Calloway." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mac_Mall> .

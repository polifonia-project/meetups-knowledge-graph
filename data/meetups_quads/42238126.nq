She began her career as an indie pop artist in Toronto in the mid-2000s, playing with local bands and writing and recording a handful of self-released albums. After relocating to Los Angeles, California, in 2013, Hughes began working with producers Cirkut and Billboard and achieved success with her first single released under the name Allie X, \"Catch\", which peaked at number 55 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and was well received by music critics.The song rose to prominence after pop singer Katy Perry referred to it as her \"spring jam\" on social media. Hughes released her debut extended play in 2015, CollXtion I, followed by her debut studio album CollXtion II in 2017, and Super Sunset in 2018.

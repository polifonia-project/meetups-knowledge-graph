<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Swana> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Elliott Swana (born 1962) is an American jazz musician who played trumpet and fl√ºgelhorn until a benign tumor forced him to put down those instruments. He then picked up the valve trombone and electronic wind instrument to continue his music profession. He began his career in clubs of his hometown of Philadelphia. He played in big bands, organ combos, and with musicians of the hard bop mainstream. Swana also worked with Ralph Bowen, Orrin Evans, Charles Fambrough, Jimmy Greene, and J. D. Walter." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Swana> .

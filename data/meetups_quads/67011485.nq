Hall worked as a teacher for many years, but after her experiences at a settlement house in New York City, she turned to suffrage work. Hall had experience working for women's suffrage in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. After her women's suffrage work, she went on to work as a saleswoman and eventually retired with her life partner to Ojai, California." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louise_Hall_(suffragist)> .

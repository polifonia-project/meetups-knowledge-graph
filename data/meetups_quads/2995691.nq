He has appeared on reality shows like Celebrity Come Dine with Me and Celebrity Big Brother. He is well known for appearing on stage heavily intoxicated at the 2000 BRIT Awards. Friends suggested that he had entered a musical contest and had won Best Musician of the Year, when in fact he had not even been nominated for the award. This resulted in a confrontation with award presenter Ronnie Wood and Thora Birch." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brandon_Block> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Atlas> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Atlas (born Angelo Siciliano; October 30, 1892 â€“ December 24, 1972) was an Italian-born American bodybuilder best remembered as the developer of a bodybuilding method and its associated exercise program which spawned a landmark advertising campaign featuring his name and likeness; it has been described as one of the longest-lasting and most memorable ad campaigns of all time. Atlas trained himself to develop his body from that of a \"scrawny weakling\", eventually becoming the most popular bodybuilder of his day. He took the name \"Charles Atlas\" after a friend told him that he resembled the statue of Atlas on top of a hotel in Coney Island and legally changed his name in 1922. He marketed his first bodybuilding course with health and fitness writer Dr. Frederick Tilney in November 1922. The duo ran the company out of Tilney's home for the first six months. In 1929, Tilney sold his half of the business to advertising man Charles P. Roman and moved to Florida. Charles Atlas Ltd. was founded in 1929 and, as of 2020, continues to market a fitness program for the \"97-pound weakling\" (44 kg). The company is now owned by Jeffrey C. Hogue." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Atlas> .

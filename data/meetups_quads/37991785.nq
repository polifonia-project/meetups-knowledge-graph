<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Hamilton_of_Preston> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Hamilton (1650â€“1701), second baronet of Preston, was one of the leaders of the Scottish Covenanters. He was the son of Sir Thomas Hamilton, and brother of Sir William, first baronet of Preston. Hamilton was educated at Glasgow University under Professor Burnet. He attached himself to the cause of the Covenanters, and appears in command at Drumclog and Bothwell Brig. After the defeat he retired to Holland, where he remained with his brother-in-law, Gordon of Earlston, until the Revolution of 1688. He declined to recognise title of Prince of Orange, on the ground that he was not a Covenanted sovereign. He was arrested in Edinburgh for being concerned in the second Sanquhar Declaration of August, 1692, issued by the \"United Societies\". On liberation, he left his testimony afresh against backsliding in Church and State, and becomes as far as one person could be the main stay of \"the afflicted Remnant.\" He died, unmarried, aged 51." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Hamilton_of_Preston> .

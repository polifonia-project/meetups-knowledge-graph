<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isabel_Allende> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Isabel Angélica Allende Llona (American Spanish: [isaˈβel aˈʝende]; born in Lima, 2 August 1942) is a Chilean writer. Allende, whose works sometimes contain aspects of the genre magical realism, is known for novels such as The House of the Spirits (La casa de los espíritus, 1982) and City of the Beasts (La ciudad de las bestias, 2002), which have been commercially successful. Allende has been called \"the world's most widely read Spanish-language author.\" In 2004, Allende was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and in 2010, she received Chile's National Literature Prize. President Barack Obama awarded her the 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom. Allende's novels are often based upon her personal experience and historical events and pay homage to the lives of women, while weaving together elements of myth and realism. She has lectured and toured many U.S. colleges to teach literature. Fluent in English, Allende was granted United States citizenship in 1993, having lived in California since 1989, first with her American husband (from whom she is now divorced)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isabel_Allende> .

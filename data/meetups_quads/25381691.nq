A native of Minneapolis, he was (with Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson) among the first Americans to study in France with Nadia Boulanger. While in Paris his Quintet for Piano and Strings (1924) garnered more praise than George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which was premiered at the same concert. He began his studies in music at the University of Minnesota, and went on to work with Ernest Bloch prior to his sojourn in France. He also attended the American Academy in Rome during which time he composed his most frequently performed work, the ballet The Happy Hypocrite (1925). In 1928 Elwell moved to Cleveland, Ohio to join the composition and music theory faculty at the Cleveland Institute of Music where he remained until 1945. He later taught at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music for nine years and spent summers teaching at the Eastman School of Music. Some of his notable pupils include , Walter Aschaffenburg, and .

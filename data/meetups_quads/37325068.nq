<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_MacDonald_of_Garth> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John MacDonald of Garth (1771 â€“ 25 January 1866) was a colourful character involved in the Canadian fur trade. He was an enthusiastic duellist and a shrewd businessman who became a partner in the North West Company and a member of the Beaver Club at Montreal, Lower Canada. In an account of his exploits, he was described as having \"indomitable courage... brave, reckless and domineering, with a decided tendency to seek redress with his own hands,\" characteristics that made him well-suited to his profession. Built in 1816, his home, Inverarden House, near Cornwall, Upper Canada, was later designated a National Historic Site of Canada. According to the 1997 book Lords of the North, by James McDonell and Robert Campbell, the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton, Alberta was named for him." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_MacDonald_of_Garth> .

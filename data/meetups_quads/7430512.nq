Rogers is a left-handed opening batsman. He spent ten years playing for Western Australia, before moving to play for Victoria in 2008. He played county cricket in England for ten years representing five first-class teams: Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Middlesex and Somerset. Rogers holds the record for most half centuries in consecutive innings. Despite being colour blind and short sighted, he maintained a first-class average of nearly 50, yet he did not play for the Australia national cricket team until the age of 30, when he was selected for a single Test match in 2008. He was recalled to the Australia national team for the 2013 Ashes series, aged 35, and over the following two years played a further 24 Tests opening the batting for Australia before retiring after the 2015 Ashes series." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Rogers_(cricketer)> .

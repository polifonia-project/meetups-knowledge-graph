Collins became well known for several characters during her tenure on the show. She was a cast member from the 4th season (1998) through the 9th season (2004); she only appeared in fourteen episodes during season nine due to contractual reasons. She returned to Mad TV in the 10th season for one episode, and again when she made an appearance on the 300th episode doing her popular character Lorraine Swanson. Her best known role following her departure from Mad TV was as morning talk show host Joan Callamezzo on the sitcom Parks and Recreation. The nickname Mo was first given to Collins by the football/drama coach of her junior high school whom she credits with introducing her to improv comedy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mo_Collins> .

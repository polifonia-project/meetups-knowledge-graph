<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connie_Ediss> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Connie Ediss (born Ada Harriet Whitley; 11 August 1870 â€“ 18 April 1934) was an English actress and singer best known as a buxom, good-humoured comedian in many of the popular Edwardian musical comedies around the turn of the 20th century. After beginning her career in provincial theatres in Britain in music hall and pantomime in the 1880s, Ediss was engaged to play in a series of extraordinarily successful musical comedies at the Gaiety Theatre, London, beginning in 1896, and also played in several musicals on Broadway. During World War I, she began a long tour in Australia, returning to London in 1919 to play in farces and comedies. She made a few films in the 1930s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connie_Ediss> .

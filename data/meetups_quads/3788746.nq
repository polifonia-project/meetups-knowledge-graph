<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jay_Irving> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jay Irving (October 3, 1900 â€“ June 3, 1970) was an American cartoonist notable for his syndicated strip Pottsy about an overweight, goodnatured, dutiful New York police officer, Pottsy, who often came into conflict with his stricter and less imaginative sergeant, known only as \"Sarge.\" Born in New York, Irving became familiar with police procedures and activities at an early age when his father, Abraham Rafsky, was a lieutenant in the New York Police Department. After attending Columbia University, Irving was employed as an insurance salesman for New York Life and a police reporter for the New York Globe." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jay_Irving> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermes_Pan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hermes Pan (born Hermes Joseph Panagiotopoulos, December 10, 1909 â€“ September 19, 1990) was an American dancer and choreographer, principally remembered as Fred Astaire's choreographic collaborator on the famous 1930s movie musicals starring Astaire and Ginger Rogers. He worked on nearly two dozen films and TV shows with Astaire. He won both an Oscar and an Emmy for his dance direction. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, as the son of a Greek immigrant and an American woman from the South, Pan moved to New York City with his family when he was 14. He started dancing in amateur productions and speakeasies. He was first paid to dance at age 19 and worked in several Broadway productions. In 1930 he moved to California, where he met Astaire in 1933 and began working with him; he choreographed 89 films." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermes_Pan> .

She is known for her multiplatinum hit singles, \"'Til They Take My Heart Away\" and \"Without Me\", both from her debut album, Let It Go. Her songs became a staple in radio stations during the early 1990s and her albums (both as recording artist and as producer) for Sheffield Lab Records have become audiophile staples and collectors items around the world. Marlo is also known for singing \"Sviraj\" and \"Lullaby\" on Paul Schwartz's album, Aria 2 - New Horizon, which reached number 5 on Billboard's Top Classical Crossover Chart in 1999." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clair_Marlo> .

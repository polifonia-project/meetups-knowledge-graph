<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claudia_Octavia> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Claudia Octavia (late 39 or early 40 â€“ June 9, AD 62) was a Roman empress. She was the daughter of the Emperor Claudius and Valeria Messalina. After her mother's death and father's remarriage to her cousin Agrippina the Younger, she became the stepsister of the future Emperor Nero. She also became his wife, in a marriage between the two which was arranged by Agrippina. Octavia was popular with the Roman people, but Nero hated their marriage. When his mistress, Poppaea Sabina, became pregnant, he divorced and banished Octavia. When this led to a public outcry, he instead had her executed." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claudia_Octavia> .

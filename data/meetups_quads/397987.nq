<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Wilkinson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Wilkinson (March 24, 1757 – December 28, 1825) was an American soldier and politician, who was associated with several scandals and controversies. He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, but he was twice compelled to resign. He was twice the Senior Officer of the U.S. Army, appointed to be the first Governor of the Louisiana Territory in 1805, and commanded two unsuccessful campaigns in the St. Lawrence River theater during the War of 1812. He died while posted as a diplomat in Mexico City. In 1854, following extensive archival research in the Spanish archives in Madrid, Louisiana historian Charles Gayarré exposed Wilkinson as having been a highly paid spy in the service of the Spanish Empire. In the years since Gayarré's research became public, Wilkinson has been savagely condemned by American historians and politicians. According to President Theodore Roosevelt, \"[I]n all our history, there is no more despicable character.\" However, he has been defended, especially in breaking up the Burr conspiracy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Wilkinson> .

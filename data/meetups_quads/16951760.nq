He was a right-arm fast bowler who was a member of the Australia national cricket team until retiring in the Ashes tour lead up of 2015 due to a knee injury. It had hampered him for a majority of his career, but despite this, he performed as one of Australia's most highly rated fast bowlers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ryan_Harris_(cricketer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigmund_Romberg> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sigmund Romberg (July 29, 1887 â€“ November 9, 1951) was a Hungarian-born American composer. He is best known for his musicals and operettas, particularly The Student Prince (1924), The Desert Song (1926) and The New Moon (1928). Early in his career, Romberg was employed by the Shubert brothers to write music for their musicals and revues, including several vehicles for Al Jolson. For the Shuberts, he also adapted several European operettas for American audiences, including the successful Maytime (1917) and Blossom Time (1921). His three hit operettas of the mid-1920s, named above, are in the style of Viennese operetta, but his other works from that time mostly employ the style of American musicals of their eras. He also composed film scores." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigmund_Romberg> .

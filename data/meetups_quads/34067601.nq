This school was started by glass artist Dale Chihuly. The 2020 Production of \"Song of Rapa Nui\", told a fascinating story about Mahani Teave who grew up on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and left at age 9 to pursue her dream of being classical pianist—a journey that takes her from mainland Chile to The Cleveland Music Institute to Berlin and the great concert halls of Europe. At the age of 30, on the brink of international success, Teave gives up her career to pursue a new dream, coming back full circle to Rapa Nui to found a free music school for the island’s children. The resulting school—named Toki, after the basalt tool once used to shape Easter Island’s iconic sculptures—is a model of sustainability, incorporating tons of tires, bottles and Pacific Ocean plastic; surrounded by agri-environmental gardens to grow food. With Toki, Mahani hopes to shape a bold new future for Rapa Nui and inspire hope and change on Earth, our island home. This is airing on Amazon Prime." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Forsen> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harriet_Martineau> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Harriet Martineau (/ˈmɑːrtɪnˌoʊ/; 12 June 1802 – 27 June 1876) was an English social theorist often seen as the first female sociologist. She wrote from a sociological, holistic, religious and feminine angle, translated works by Auguste Comte, and, rarely for a woman writer at the time, earned enough to support herself. The young Princess Victoria enjoyed her work and invited her to her 1838 coronation. Martineau advised \"a focus on all [society's] aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions\". She applied thorough analysis to women's status under men. The novelist Margaret Oliphant called her \"a born lecturer and politician... less distinctively affected by her sex than perhaps any other, male or female, of her generation.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harriet_Martineau> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vicente_Aranda> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vicente Aranda Ezquerra (Spanish: [biˈθente aɾanˈða eθˈkera]; 9 November 1926 – 26 May 2015) was a Spanish film director, screenwriter and producer. Due to his refined and personal style, he was one of the most renowned Spanish filmmakers. He started as a founding member of the Barcelona School of Film and became known for bringing contemporary Spanish novels to life on the big screen. Aranda was also noted for exploring difficult social issues and variations on the theme of desire while using the codes of melodrama. Love as uncontrollable passion, eroticism and cruelty are constant themes in his filmography. The frank examination of sexuality is one of the trademarks of his work, as seen in his most internationally successful film: Amantes (1990) (Lovers)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vicente_Aranda> .

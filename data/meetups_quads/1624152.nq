He is best known for his work with the band Steppenwolf. Monarch was born in Los Angeles. As the original lead guitarist with Steppenwolf (1967 through most of 1969), he played on all their hits, including \"Born to Be Wild\", \"Magic Carpet Ride\", and \"Rock Me\", while still a teenager. He also played on Janis Joplin's album I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! and was a member of the Michael Des Barres-fronted band Detective. Monarch also worked with Roger Glover of Deep Purple, Andy Fraser of Free, Chris Hillman of the Byrds and others including many recording projects throughout the years.

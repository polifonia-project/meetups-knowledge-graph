<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Crowder> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Steven Blake Crowder (/ˈkraʊdər/ KROW-dər; born July 7, 1987) is an American-Canadian conservative political commentator and media host. Early in his career, Crowder worked for Fox News and posted satirical videos on conservative media platforms. He then began hosting Louder with Crowder, a daily political podcast and YouTube channel with conservative commentary and comedic content. It includes a recurring segment called \"Change My Mind\", in which Crowder invites passers-by to converse. In December 2012, Crowder and members of Americans for Prosperity were involved in an altercation at a demonstration in Michigan concerning the state's recently passed right-to-work law. Crowder's YouTube channel has been demonetized twice, first in 2019 after repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs. His channel was re-monetized after YouTube said Crowder addressed his behavior and content, and it was demonetized again in March 2021, with uploads suspended for a week, after violating YouTube's presidential election integrity policy for advancing false claims about the election's integrity. YouTube suspended the channel again for two weeks in October 2022 for violating its harassment, threats and cyberbullying policy. The channel had 5.86 million subscribers as of 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steven_Crowder> .

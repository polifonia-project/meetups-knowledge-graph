<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregory_Doran> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gregory Doran (born 24 November 1958) is an English director known for his Shakespearean work. The Sunday Times called him 'one of the great Shakespearians of his generation'. Doran was artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), succeeding Michael Boyd in September 2012. In an interview, announcing his appointment, Doran said that whilst Boyd had concentrated on the 'Company', he would be concentrating on the 'Shakespeare' in the Royal Shakespeare Company logo. Since April 2022 he is director emeritus at the Royal Shakespeare Company. His notable productions include a production of Macbeth starring Antony Sher, which was filmed for Channel 4 in 2001, as well as Hamlet in 2008, starring David Tennant and Patrick Stewart." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregory_Doran> .

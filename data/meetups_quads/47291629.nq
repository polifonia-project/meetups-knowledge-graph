<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Peterson_(artist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jon Peterson (1945–2020) was an American artist, most known for his \"guerrilla sculpture\" in the 1980s and his stylistically eclectic paintings in the 2000s. He was active in the emergence of Los Angeles’s downtown art scene—partly captured in the 1982 documentary, Young Turks—as both an artist and real estate developer. His work has been commissioned by or exhibited at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), the San Diego Museum of Art, Washington Project for the Arts, Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Houston Art Festival, Foundation for Art Resources, and the International Sculpture Conference. It has been discussed in Artforum, Art in America, ARTnews, Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post and The Village Voice, and recognized by the National Endowment of the Arts. Museum director and one-time Artforum critic Richard Armstrong wrote that his outdoor, urban \"Bum Shelters\" \"neatly grafted function and relevance onto the sadly barren tree of public sculpture\"; critic Peter Plagens called them \"hand-made, subtly irregular riff[s] on Minimalism\" that injected social consciousness into \"erstwhile formalist work.\" Reviewers liken his painting practice in the 2000s to the \"polymath\"-model of Gerhard Richter, interchanging diverse styles and genres as a means to understanding the nature of painting itself. Peterson died March 4, 2020, at the age of 74, and is survived by his wife, Tanarat, and son, Raymond." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jon_Peterson_(artist)> .

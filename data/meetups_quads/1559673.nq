<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_L._Jackson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edward L. Jackson (December 27, 1873 â€“ November 18, 1954) was an American attorney, judge and politician, elected the 32nd governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from January 12, 1925, to January 14, 1929. He had also been elected as Secretary of State of Indiana. Jackson associated with Ku Klux Klan leaders, and became involved in several political scandals. He was accused of favoring the Klan's agenda while in office. In 1927 he was investigated and tried on bribery charges related to having tried to bribe the previous governor, but was not convicted as the statute of limitations had expired. After finishing his term in office, he left in disgrace and never ran again for public office." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_L._Jackson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Ramchand> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kenneth Ramchand (born 1939) is a Trinidad and Tobago academic and writer, who is widely respected as \"arguably the most prominent living critic of Caribbean fiction\". He has written extensively on many West Indian authors, including V. S. Naipaul, Earl Lovelace and Sam Selvon, as well as editing several significant cultural publications. His seminal text, The West Indian Novel and Its Background (1970), had a transformational effect on the syllabus of the University of the West Indies (UWI) and the internationalization of West Indian literature as an academic discipline. Ramchand is Professor Emeritus of English at the St. Augustine campus of UWI. Until his resignation in June 2009, he was associate provost at the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT). He was for some years an independent Senator in the Senate of Trinidad and Tobago. Ramchand is also an Emeritus Professor at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenneth_Ramchand> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence_Page_Jaques> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Florence Page Jaques (March 7, 1890 â€“ January 1, 1972) was an American author who wrote nature and travel books for adults, and short stories and poetry for children. Born in Decatur, Illinois, she attended Millikin University in Decatur, completing an A.B. degree there in 1911 before doing graduate work at Columbia University in New York City. She married Francis Lee Jaques, a wildlife painter for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, on May 12, 1927. Together they produced seven illustrated outdoor travel books, including Snowshoe Country, winner of the John Burroughs Medal in 1946 for distinguished work in natural history. The couple left New York for North Oaks, Minnesota, a suburb of Saint Paul, in 1953, and lived there for the rest of their lives. Francis died in 1969 and Florence in 1972." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence_Page_Jaques> .

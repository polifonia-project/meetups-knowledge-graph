Her work is among the earliest known recordings in the singer-songwriter genre of music. Converse left her family home in 1974 in search of a new life and was not heard from again. Her music was largely unknown until it was featured on a 2004 radio show. In March 2009, a compilation album of her work, How Sad, How Lovely, was released." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connie_Converse> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brendan_Gamble> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brendan Gamble (born 1966) is an American singer-songwriter, producer and engineer. A native of Urbana, Illinois, Gamble was the formative figure behind, and second drummer of the post-wave group Poster Children. When Gamble joined the band in 1988, they had played mostly simple pop material featuring traditional verse-chorus structure and 4/4 time signature. Among his creative projects after leaving Poster Children, Gamble was invited to perform with an existing trio—three-quarters of the Champaign-Urbana band Obvious Man—and became the new singer and rhythm guitarist in the group, which was renamed Stark." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brendan_Gamble> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Katherine_Harris> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Katherine Harris (born April 5, 1957) is a former American politician. A Republican, Harris served in the Florida Senate from 1994 to 1998, as Secretary of State of Florida from 1999 to 2002, and as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Florida's 13th congressional district from 2003 to 2007. Harris lost her campaign in 2006 for a United States Senate seat from Florida. In the 2000 presidential election, she received international attention for her role as the Florida's secretary of state during the state's election recount, certifying George W. Bush's narrow victory (537 votes) over Al Gore and awarding him the Florida electors, which gained him the national election." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Katherine_Harris> .

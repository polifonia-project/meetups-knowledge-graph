He began piano lessons at the age of 4 years and by the time he was 10, he had won his first prize. In 1984 Vayne began his study at the conservatorium in Zwolle and he graduated with a soloist diploma. He received much acclaim after several appearances on Dutch television talk shows. He has made several CDs and has given many concerts. In 1997 he was invited to perform a concert in the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC to honour President William Clinton's second-term inauguration.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raymond_Hanson_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Raymond (Charles) Hanson AM (23 November 1913 â€“ 6 December 1976) was an Australian composer and lecturer in composition at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music now known as the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. A highly regarded teacher and mentor to many prominent Australian musicians, such as Don Burrows, Larry Sitsky and Roger Woodward, Hanson himself was largely self-taught. As a composer, Hanson was not a follower of prevailing trends, and consequently his music was unfashionable and ignored by many other composers. Late in life however, his distinctive personal style began to receive greater recognition, and since his death his work has been held in high esteem by some critics." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raymond_Hanson_(composer)> .

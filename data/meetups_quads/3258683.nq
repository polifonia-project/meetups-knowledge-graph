<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stormy_Daniels> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephanie Gregory Clifford (born March 17, 1979), known professionally as Stormy Daniels, is an American pornographic film actress and director, and former stripper. She has won numerous industry awards, and is a member of the NightMoves, AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame. In 2009, a recruitment effort led her to consider challenging incumbent David Vitter for the 2010 Senate election in her native Louisiana. In 2018, Daniels became involved in a legal dispute with U.S. president Donald Trump and his attorney Michael Cohen. Trump and his surrogates paid $130,000 hush money to silence Daniels about an affair she says she had with Trump in 2006. Trump's spokespeople have denied the affair and accused Daniels of lying." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stormy_Daniels> .

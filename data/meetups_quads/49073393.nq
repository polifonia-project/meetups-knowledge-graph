Bruce uses an artistic approach to filmmaking alongside the use of digital technologies. Her use of digital film is accredited to the speed, creativity, and multi-layering that can be accessed through the technology. Daily Variety featured Bruce in their article \"10 Digital Directors To Watch\"(2000) and noted that Bruce takes her inspiration from the surrealists, Andrei Tarkovsky, and painting." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nichola_Bruce> .

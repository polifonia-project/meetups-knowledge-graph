<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lottie_Pickford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charlotte Smith (June 9, 1893 â€“ December 9, 1936), known professionally as Lottie Pickford, was a Canadian-American silent film actress and socialite. She was the younger sister of fellow actress Mary Pickford and elder sister of actor Jack Pickford. One of her best known roles was in The Diamond from the Sky directed by William Desmond Taylor in 1915. Pickford's career often is overshadowed by that of her siblings and though she was a notable figure in the 1920s, her films and role in the Pickford acting family largely are forgotten." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lottie_Pickford> .

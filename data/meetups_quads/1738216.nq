His particular area of interest was 17th and 18th century musical figures that were active in England. Considered an authority on the life and works of George Frideric Handel, he notably published several books on the famous composer. Smith also had a large private collection of Handel works, some of them original manuscripts. He was also interested in chronicling the work of English music engravers and publishers of the period. Smith was born in London. From 1900 to 1944 he was on staff of the British Museum, serving as Assistant Keeper of Printed Books from 1920 – 1944. He died in Bromley in 1972 at the age of 91." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Charles_Smith> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Parkin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Alex Parkin, OAM (born 12 September 1942) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach who played for the Hawthorn Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and for the Subiaco Football Club in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). However, Parkin's stature in the history of Australian rules football is based mainly on his achievements as a coach. Building on his experience as a player and educator, Parkin won four premierships (one at Hawthorn, three at Carlton) and is considered one of the most influential coaches of the modern era." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Parkin> .

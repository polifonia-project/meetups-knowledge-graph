<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royall_Tyler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Royall Tyler (June 18, 1757 â€“ August 26, 1826) was an American jurist and playwright. He was born in Boston, graduated from Harvard University in 1776, and then served in the Massachusetts militia during the American Revolution. He was admitted to the bar in 1780, became a lawyer, and fathered eleven children. In 1801, he was appointed a Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. He wrote a play, The Contrast, which was produced in 1787 in New York City, shortly after George Washington's inauguration. It is considered the first American comedy. Washington attended the production, which was well-received, and Tyler became a literary celebrity." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royall_Tyler> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Roberts_(filmmaker)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Alan Brownell (November 2, 1946 â€“ July 3, 2016), known professionally as Alan Roberts, was an American filmmaker best known for directing low-budget films including Karate Cop and The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. Roberts began his career as a director. After 1994 most of his work was as an editor. Roberts' Young Lady Chatterly series is \"a classical vehicle in the Emmanuelle mode.\" In 1983, Roberts designed and produced the adult-themed Atari 2600 game X-Man. The game was controversial and sold poorly. In 2011, Roberts was involved in production of the film Desert Warriors. The film was substantially altered by others, and released as the anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims in 2012." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Roberts_(filmmaker)> .

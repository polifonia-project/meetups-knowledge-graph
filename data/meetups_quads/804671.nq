She co-founded Wilson Phillips with her older sister, Carnie, and childhood friend Chynna Phillips when they were in their teens. Wilson Phillips released two albums in 1990 and 1992 before splitting up. Wendy and Carnie released a Christmas album together in 1993, and an album called The Wilsons in 1997, with their formerly estranged father, Brian. In 2004, Wendy reunited with Carnie and Phillips for a third Wilson Phillips album, California. In 2012, the reunited Wilson Phillips released the album, Dedicated, which comprised covers of songs by The Beach Boys and The Mamas & the Papas. In June 2012, Wendy joined her sister Carnie and other members of the Beach Boys' families to form the vocal group, California Saga, which performed at the intermission during the homecoming Hollywood Bowl show of the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary tour." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wendy_Wilson> .

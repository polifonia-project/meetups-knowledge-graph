<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Berrigan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniel Joseph Berrigan SJ (May 9, 1921 â€“ April 30, 2016) was an American Jesuit priest, anti-war activist, Christian pacifist, playwright, poet, and author. Berrigan's active protest against the Vietnam War earned him both scorn and admiration, especially regarding his association with the Catonsville Nine. It also landed him on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \"most wanted list\" (the first-ever priest on the list), on the cover of Time magazine, and in prison. For the rest of his life, Berrigan remained one of the United States' leading anti-war activists. In 1980, he co-founded the Plowshares movement, an anti-nuclear protest group, that put him back into the national spotlight. Berrigan was an award-winning and prolific author of some 50 books, a teacher, and a university educator." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daniel_Berrigan> .

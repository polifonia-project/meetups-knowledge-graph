<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Parrott> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Stephen Parrott, MBE (born 11 May 1964) is an English former professional snooker player and television personality. He was a familiar face on the professional snooker circuit during the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, and remained within the top 16 of the world rankings for fourteen consecutive seasons. He reached the final of the 1989 World Championship, where he lost 3–18 to Steve Davis, the heaviest defeat in a world championship final in modern times. He won the title two years later, defeating Jimmy White in the final of the 1991 World Championship. He repeated his win against White later the same year, to take the 1991 UK Championship title, becoming only the third player to win both championships in the same calendar year (after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry); he is still one of only six players to have achieved this feat. He spent three seasons at number 2 in the world rankings (1989–90, 1992–93, 1993–94), and he is one of several players to have achieved more than 200 competitive centuries during his career, with 221." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Parrott> .

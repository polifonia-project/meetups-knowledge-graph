He achieved international fame through his television series The Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran on the BBC from 1979 to 1994. Daniels was known for his catchphrase \"You'll like this... not a lot, but you'll like it!\", and for his marriage to his assistant, Debbie McGee. He was awarded the \"Magician of the Year\" Award by the Academy of Magical Arts in 1982, the first magician from outside the United States to receive it. He also won the Golden Rose of Montreux in 1985. He was a Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star. He has been described as \"The Godfather of Magic\" and has been repeatedly credited with inspiring many top professional magicians to start in the profession. Daniels was outspoken on matters including politics, current affairs, magic, entertainment, and fellow celebrities. Towards the end of his life he also appeared in reality television shows. He was described by former BBC executive Lord Grade upon his death as \"a genius\", \"a brilliant showman\" and a \"pillar of Saturday Night for the BBC in their golden era of ratings\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Daniels> .

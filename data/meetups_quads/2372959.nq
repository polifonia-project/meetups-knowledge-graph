Gardner grew up outside Morristown, New Jersey, and played for a band called Royal Flush while a student at the Pingry School, from which he graduated in 1991. He also attended Harding Township School in New Vernon, New Jersey. Gardner, working with Dave Schneider, created a side-project in 2005 called The LeeVees. Its album, Hanukkah Rocks, consists of humorous original songs about the Jewish holiday. After living in Brooklyn near the other members of Guster for a time, Gardner relocated to Maine. Gardner broadcasts a weekly radio show in Portland, Maine where he discusses everything from music to environmental issues." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_Gardner> .

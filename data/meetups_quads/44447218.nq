After her death, the Caroline Walker Trust was established with a mission to \"improve public health by means of good food\". At the 2019 annual Evening of Celebration for Walker and of the trust held at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, speaker Felicity Lawrence of The Guardian, a friend and colleague of Walker, said \"She was the lodestar for campaigning around food and social justice that has guided me, and influenced countless others, ever since… She had a unique combination of erudition and academic ability with human warmth, and a gift for popular communication. She was a great phrase-maker, and a witty story-teller… She could simplify to communicate because she had such deep understanding of the science behind her subject. That was rare. And precious\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caroline_Walker_(food_campaigner)> .

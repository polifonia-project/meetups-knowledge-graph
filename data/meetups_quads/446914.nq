<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Bradlee> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee (August 26, 1921 â€“ October 21, 2014) was an American journalist who served as managing editor, then as executive editor of The Washington Post, from 1965 to 1991. He became a public figure when the Post joined The New York Times in publishing the Pentagon Papers and gave the go-ahead for the paper's extensive coverage of the Watergate scandal. He was also criticized for editorial lapses when the Post had to return a Pulitzer Prize in 1981 after it discovered its award-winning story was false. After his retirement, Bradlee continued to be associated with the Post, holding the position of Vice President at-large until his death. In retirement, Bradlee was an advocate for education and the study of history, including his role as a trustee on the boards of several major educational, historical, and archaeological research institutions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ben_Bradlee> .

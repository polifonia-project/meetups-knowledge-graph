<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elaine_Summers> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lillian Elaine Summers (February 20, 1925 â€“ December 27, 2014) was an American choreographer, experimental filmmaker, and intermedia pioneer. She was a founding member of the original workshop-group that would form the Judson Dance Theater and she significantly contributed to the interaction of film and dance, as well as the expansion of dance into other related disciplines, such as visual art, film, and theater. She fostered the expansion of performing dance in new, often outdoor locations. Her movement approach Kinetic Awareness offers a comprehensive perspective on human movement and dance. She died at Bellevue Hospital, New York, on the morning of December 27, 2014, after a fall at her home." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elaine_Summers> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Lucas> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Charles Lucas, 1613 to 28 August 1648, was a professional soldier from Essex, who served as a Royalist cavalry leader during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Taken prisoner at the end of the First English Civil War in March 1646, he was released after swearing not to fight against Parliament again, an oath he broke when the Second English Civil War began in 1648. As a result, he was executed following his capture at the Siege of Colchester in August 1648, and became a Royalist martyr after the 1660 Stuart Restoration. Royalist statesman and historian Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, described Lucas as \"rough, proud, uncultivated and morose\", but \"a gallant man to look upon and follow\". A brave and capable cavalry commander with a reputation for bad temper and ruthlessness, he is chiefly remembered for the manner of his death." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Lucas> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Moran_Bailey> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Moran Bailey (November 23, 1904 â€“ April 10, 1975) was an American politician who played a major role in promoting the New Deal coalition of the Democratic Party and its liberal policy positions. Bailey dominated Connecticut Democratic politics as a party chairman, from 1946 to his death in 1975. He typically had a decisive voice in selecting the party's candidates for top offices and in coordinating Democrats in the state legislature. He was even more powerful as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1961 until 1968, and was one of the main behind-the-scenes backers of John F. Kennedy. An Irish Catholic, Bailey was educated at The Catholic University of America and Harvard Law School." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Moran_Bailey> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicola_Roberts> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nicola Maria Roberts (born 5 October 1985) is a British pop singer. She rose to prominence in late 2002 upon winning a place in Girls Aloud, a girl group created through ITV's Popstars: The Rivals. The group's success helped them win the competition and they were later entered in Guinness World Records as the most successful reality television music-group. They enjoyed 20 consecutive top-ten singles, spawning five albums and positive critical responses. In 2008, after releasing the pale skin make-up collection Dainty Doll, Roberts advocated, in the documentary Nicola Roberts: The Truth About Tanning, a ban on underage usage of tanning beds. Her public stance with a British MP led to a bill which banned under-18s from using tanning beds. In 2011, Roberts released her debut solo album, Cinderella's Eyes, which peaked at number 17 on the UK Albums Chart, and respectively produced the successful single \"Beat of My Drum\". Two follow-up singles, \"Lucky Day\" and \"Yo-Yo\", both gained equally positive critical responses but were not huge hits. In February 2020, Roberts won the first series of ITV's The Masked Singer UK, masked as Queen Bee and in 2021, Roberts returned in the final of the second series as a guest judge. She later returned in the third series final in 2022 to perform a duet masked as Queen Bee with Markus Feehily masked as Robobunny." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicola_Roberts> .

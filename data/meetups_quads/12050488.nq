<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeffrey_Hatrix> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeff Hatrix, also known as Jeffrey Nothing (born Jeffrey Lewis Hetrick), is an American musician, best known as the former clean vocalist for the heavy metal band Mushroomhead. His nickname comes from a scene in Blue Velvet. With a wide variety of face paint and mask designs, Jeffrey's most known look is that of a butcher. However, he revealed a new look in the music video of \"Your Soul Is Mine\", showing a tan skin mask that somewhat resembles the infamous Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. Two of his masks were made from face-molds of famous actors Christopher Lloyd and Bela Lugosi. His most recent incarnation is that of a mask resembling human hands. He is signed as a solo artist to Suburban Noize Records." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeffrey_Hatrix> .

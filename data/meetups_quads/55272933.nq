<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlotte_Kemp_(missionary)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charlotte Kemp (née Butcher, 27 July 1790 – 22 June 1860) was a missionary for the Church of England, co-founding the second Church Mission Station in New Zealand at Kerikeri. Born in England, she came to New Zealand with her husband, James Kemp, in 1819 and settled in Kerikeri where the CMS station was founded. She taught at the station's schools and raised her eight children. One died as an infant and this led to her having a mental breakdown. She recovered and by 1840, she and her husband were the only missionaries in Kerikeri. During the Flagstaff War, they were two of the few Europeans to remain in the area during the conflict. She died in Kerikeri at the age of 70." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlotte_Kemp_(missionary)> .

Wilson wrote or co-wrote numerous hit songs during more than 40 years in the industry, including songs for David Houston, Jean Shepard, Charlie Rich, Charley Pride, George Jones, and Tammy Wynette, among many others. He also produced or co-produced songs for dozens of artists, including early Reba McEntire, Joe Stampley, Margo Smith, Sara Evans, Kenny Chesney, and Shania Twain. Earlier in his career, Wilson also charted ten singles on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Songs chart. The biggest of his three Top 40 hits was \"Do It to Someone You Love\" (written by Tom T. Hall) which reached No. 20 in 1970. He also recorded two songs, \"Hey, Mister!\" and \"Mama McClusky\", that were the basis for Charlie Rich's 1973 number one song, \"The Most Beautiful Girl\". He died on June 8, 2017, in Nashville from heart failure." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norro_Wilson> .

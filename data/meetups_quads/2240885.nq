<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Johnson_(bassist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Louis Johnson (April 13, 1955 â€“ May 21, 2015) was an American bass guitarist. Johnson was best known for his work with the group the Brothers Johnson and his session playing on several hit albums of the 1970s and 1980s, including the best-selling album of all time, Michael Jackson's Thriller. His signature sound came from the Music Man StingRay bass guitar, which Leo Fender made for him, and from his slapping technique. He is ranked number 38 on Bass Player magazine's list of \"the 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Johnson_(bassist)> .

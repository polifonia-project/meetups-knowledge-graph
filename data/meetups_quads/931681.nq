He was born in Kidderminster and educated at Durham University from which he took his pen name Cuthbert Bede, B.A. His most popular book was The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green, on the experiences of an Oxford undergraduate. There was a sequel, Little Mr Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green. Tales of College Life (often bound with it), introduces the character of Mr Affable Canary. The celebrated illustrations to the Verdant Green books were the work of the author." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Bradley_(writer)> .

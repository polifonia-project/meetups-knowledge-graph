<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl-Heinz_Riedle> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Karl-Heinz Riedle (German pronunciation: [kaʁlˈhaɪnts ˈʁiːdlə]; born 16 September 1965) is a German former professional footballer who played as a striker. Despite not being particularly tall, he was nicknamed \"Air\" throughout his career, due to his notable heading accuracy, jumping and timing skills in the air, as well as his ability to make runs into the box and get on the end of crosses, and made a name for himself as a traditional yet well-rounded and prolific centre forward. He appeared in 207 Bundesliga games over the course of eight seasons, scoring 62 of his 72 goals for Werder Bremen and Borussia Dortmund. He also played for Lazio in Italy and Liverpool in England. A German international for six years, Riedle represented the country in two World Cups – winning the 1990 edition – and Euro 1992." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl-Heinz_Riedle> .

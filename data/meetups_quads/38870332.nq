<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shelly_Miscavige> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michele Diane Miscavige (n√©e Barnett; born January 18, 1961) is a member of the Church of Scientology, married to Scientology leader David Miscavige. She was last seen in public in August 2007. Since her withdrawal from public appearances, she has been the subject of speculation and inquiries regarding her whereabouts and wellbeing. In 2012, attorneys who said they represented her responded by saying she was merely living a private life devoted to the Church of Scientology. In August 2013, actress Leah Remini, a former Scientologist and vocal critic of the organization, filed a missing person report regarding Miscavige with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Within a few days of receiving the report, the LAPD stated that they located Miscavige, and further stated that she was not actually missing, so the case was closed. A further communication by an attorney representing the Church of Scientology in 2018 indicated that she continues to be a dedicated Sea Org member and is continuing to live a private life." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shelly_Miscavige> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Regan_(comedian)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brian Joseph Regan (/ˈriːɡən/) (born June 2, 1958) is an American stand-up comedian who uses observational, sarcastic, and self-deprecating humor. He is known for incorporating body language and facial expressions into his act. His performances are often described as clean as he refrains from profanity as well as taboo subject matter. Regan's material typically covers everyday events, such as shipping a package with UPS, mortgages, and visits to the optometrist. While he does not define himself as youth-oriented, Regan makes frequent references to childhood, including little league baseball, grade school spelling bees, and science projects. Regan started out doing standup comedy in the 1980s and made his television debut on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in 1991. Regan subsequently released his first standup album, Brian Regan: Live in 1997 and has performed on various talk shows including The Dennis Miller Show, Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. He has since gained acclaim among fans and comedians, selling out nationwide tours and continuing to release comedy albums. In 2014 he made his film debut making an appearance in Chris Rock's comedy Top Five (2014). Since 2017, he has starred in Peter Farrelly's dark comedy series Loudermilk (2017-2020) on Amazon Prime. He has appeared twice on Jerry Seinfeld's show Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee and has released three Netflix comedy specials. In 2018, Regan's sketch comedy series Standup and Away! with Brian Regan which was produced by Seinfeld, was released on Netflix." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Regan_(comedian)> .

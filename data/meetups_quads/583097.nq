He also writes the music, and is the main performer for, the virtual melodic death metal band Dethklok, which began as the subject of Metalocalypse but has taken on a life of its own, with four albums and an occasional live touring band, headed by Small. Small has also released two albums under his own name, in a similar musical style to Dethklok." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brendon_Small> .

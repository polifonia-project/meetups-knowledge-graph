He was a counselor in the United States Department of State under Condoleezza Rice from 2007 to 2009. In 2019, Cohen was named the 9th Dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University, succeeding the former dean, Vali Nasr. Before his time as dean, he directed the Strategic Studies Program at SAIS. Cohen \"is one of the few teachers in the American academy to treat military history as a serious field\", according to international law scholar Ruth Wedgwood. Cohen is a contributing writer at The Atlantic. He is also, with Eric Edelman, the cohost of the Shield of the Republic podcast, published by The Bulwark." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eliot_A._Cohen> .

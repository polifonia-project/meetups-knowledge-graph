<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McCollum> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John M. McCollum (February 21, 1922 â€“ October 30, 2015) was an American tenor who had an active singing career in operas, concerts, and recitals during the 1950s through the 1970s. As an opera singer he performed with companies throughout North America, mostly working with second tier opera houses. He was much more successful as a singer of oratorios and other works from the concert repertoire, and enjoyed a particularly productive and lengthy relationship with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. As a concert singer he sang a wide repertoire but drew particular acclaim for his performances in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_McCollum> .

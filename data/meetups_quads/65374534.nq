<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutchavelli> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephan Fabulous Allen (born 11 November 1993), better known by his stage name Dutchavelli, is a British rapper. His name comes in part from the fact that he and his family (including his sister, singer and rapper Stefflon Don) spent their formative years in Rotterdam, and he initially went under the name 'Dutch'. He has worked with artists such as Stormzy, Gzuz and Tion Wayne and has achieved Top 40 hits with songs such as \"I Dunno\", \"Burning\" and \"808\", the former peaking at number 7 in the charts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutchavelli> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Grant_(music_manager)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Grant (5 April 1935 â€“ 21 November 1995) was an English music manager, best known as the manager of Led Zeppelin from their creation in 1968 to their breakup in 1980. With his intimidating size and weight, confrontational manner, and knowledge and experience, he procured strong, and unprecedented, deals for his band, and is widely credited with improving pay and conditions for all musicians in dealings with concert promoters. Grant has been described as \"one of the shrewdest and most ruthless managers in rock history\". Born and largely brought up in the south London suburb of South Norwood, England by his mother, he worked variously as a stagehand, bouncer, wrestler, bit-part actor, and UK tour manager for acts such as Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent and the Animals, before getting involved briefly in band management with the Nashville Teens and the Yardbirds. He was also a record executive for Swan Song Records." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Grant_(music_manager)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottis_Toole> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ottis Elwood Toole (March 5, 1947 â€“ September 15, 1996) was an American drifter and serial killer who was convicted of six counts of murder. Like his companion Henry Lee Lucas, Toole made confessions which he later recanted, which resulted in murder convictions. The discrediting of the case against Lucas for crimes for which Toole had offered corroborating statements created doubts as to whether either was a genuine serial killer or, as Hugh Aynesworth suggested, both were merely compliant interviewees who police used to clear unsolved murders from the books. Toole received two death sentences, but on appeal, they were commuted to life imprisonment. He died in his cell from cirrhosis, at age 49. Police attributed the 1981 murder of Adam Walsh to Toole on the basis of recanted statements. Lucas had backed Toole's confession to the Walsh murder, claiming that he had been in possession of the victim's severed head, though Lucas had a reputation for false confessions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottis_Toole> .

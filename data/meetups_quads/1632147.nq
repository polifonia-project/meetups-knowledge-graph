<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stella_Vine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stella Vine (born Melissa Jane Robson, 1969) is an English artist, who lives and works in London. Her work is figurative painting, with subjects drawn from personal life, as well as from rock stars, royalty, and other celebrities. In 2001, she was exhibited by the Stuckists group, which she joined for a short time; she was married briefly to the group co-founder, Charles Thomson. In 2003, she opened her own gallery Rosy Wilde in East London. In 2004, Charles Saatchi bought Hi Paul can you come over I'm really frightened (2003), a painting of Diana, Princess of Wales, which provoked media controversy, as did a subsequent purchase of a painting of drug victim Rachel Whitear. Later work has featured Kate Moss as a subject, as in Holy water cannot help you now (2005). In 2006, she re-opened her gallery in Soho, London. The first major show of her work was held in 2007 at Modern Art Oxford. In the same year, Vine designed clothing for Topshop." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stella_Vine> .

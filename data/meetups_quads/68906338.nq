Her style typically involves creating layered soundscapes on the guitar, making extensive use of effects pedals and e-bows. Her music has been described as \"icy drones and beautifully spare sounds\" by the Allmusic reviewer. In 2019, she collaborated with Iggy Pop on his album Free." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarah_Lipstate> .

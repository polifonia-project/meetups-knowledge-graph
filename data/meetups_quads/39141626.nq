He is credited by reggae historians for the birth of rocksteady in the 1960s. Rocksteady later mixed with Jamaican mento, a genre in which Khouri also had a pioneering role, leading to the creation of reggae music. Khouri signed American singer Johnny Nash to record Jamaican music, producing his first international hit \"Hold Me Tight\", which went on to sell six million copies globally and has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts. He also produced Nash's biggest hit in the UK \"Tears on my Pillow\", which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in July 1975 for one week." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Khouri> .

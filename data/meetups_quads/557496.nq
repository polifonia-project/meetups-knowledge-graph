<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jan_Sterling> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jan Sterling (born Jane Sterling Adriance; April 3, 1921 â€“ March 26, 2004) was an American film, television and stage actress. At her most active in films during the 1950s (immediately prior to which she had joined the Actors Studio), Sterling received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in The High and the Mighty (1954), as well as an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. Her best performance is often considered to be opposite Kirk Douglas, as the opportunistic wife in Billy Wilder's 1951 Ace in the Hole. Although her career declined during the 1960s, she continued to play occasional television and theatre roles." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jan_Sterling> .

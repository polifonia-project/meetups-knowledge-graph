She wrote and directed the controversial film, She Must Be Seeing Things (1987). Her debut feature film, (1984), which she co-directed with writer Lynne Tillman, is an experimental narrative of the life of Frances Farmer, shot on a low budget of $45,000. McLaughlin's films have been described as presenting \"a grasp of a developing new feminist language of cinema.\" McLaughlin left filmmaking to practice acupuncture." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheila_McLaughlin> .

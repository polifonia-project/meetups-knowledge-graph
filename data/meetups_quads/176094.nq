<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricardo_Mayorga> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ricardo Antonio Mayorga Perez (born October 3, 1973) is a Nicaraguan professional boxer and former mixed martial artist. In boxing he is a former two-weight world champion, having held the unified WBA (Unified), WBC, Ring magazine, and lineal welterweight titles in 2003, and the WBC super welterweight title from 2005 to 2006. Mayorga first became well known to boxing fans upon being featured on the cover of The Ring's December 2003 issue, entitled \"The craziest man in the sport: Mayorga lights up boxing.\" He has since maintained this infamous reputation with his relentless trash-talk in the build-up to most of his fights, as well as his smoking and drinking habits outside the ring." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ricardo_Mayorga> .

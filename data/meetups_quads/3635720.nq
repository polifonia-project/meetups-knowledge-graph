Described by AllMusic as \"one of Scotland's premier singer-songwriters\", MacLean has performed both under his own name, and as part of multiple folk bands, since the mid 1970s. His most famous pieces include \"Caledonia\", which is often dubbed Scotland's \"unofficial national anthem\"; and \"The Gael\", which became the main theme to the 1992 film The Last of the Mohicans. MacLean's songs have been covered by numerous popular artists. Aside from his career as a touring singer-songwriter, MacLean founded the Dunkeld Records label and recording studio with his wife Jennifer in 1983." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dougie_MacLean> .

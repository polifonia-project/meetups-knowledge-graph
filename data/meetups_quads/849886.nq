Flintoff played all forms of the game and was one of the sport's leading all-rounders, a fast bowler, middle-order batsman, and slip fielder. He was consistently rated by the ICC as being among the top international all-rounders in both ODI and Test cricket. Following his debut in 1998, he became an integral player for England, and was England's \"Man of the Series\" in the 2005 Ashes. He later served as both captain and vice-captain of the team. He retired from Test cricket at the end of the 2009 Ashes series, and from other forms of the game in 2010. He then had one professional boxing fight on 30 November 2012 in Manchester, beating American Richard Dawson on a points decision. In 2014, Flintoff came out of retirement to play Twenty20 cricket for Lancashire, before being signed by Brisbane Heat to play in the Australian Big Bash League for the 2014â€“15 season. Since his retirement, Flintoff has been involved with numerous projects, including designing his own fashion range and becoming the face of the brand Jacamo, winning the first series of the Australian version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and being part of Sky One's sports-based comedy panel show A League of Their Own. Flintoff became a presenter of the BBC One show Top Gear in 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Flintoff> .

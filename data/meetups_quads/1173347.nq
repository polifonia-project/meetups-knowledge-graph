<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tenali_Rama> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tenali Ramakrishna (born Garlapati Ramakrishna; also known as Tenali Rama) was an Indian poet, scholar, thinker and a special advisor in the court of the Vijayanagar king Krishnadevaraya, who ruled from C.E. 1509 to 1529. He was a Telugu poet who hailed from a village called Tenali located at what is now the Andhra Pradesh region, generally known for the folk tales which focus on his wit. He was one of the Ashtadiggajas or the eight poets at the court of Krishnadevaraya. His father died when he was a child. To overcome the depression that Rama faced, his mother Laká¹£amma took him to Vijayanagar where he became an advisor to Sri Krishnadevaraya and the 8th scholar in his court. He was a great scholar and poet of Telugu language. Tenali Ramakrishna was also a minister of the court." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tenali_Rama> .

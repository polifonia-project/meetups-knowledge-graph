<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Sickert> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Walter Richard Sickert RA RBA (31 May 1860 â€“ 22 January 1942) was a German-born British painter and printmaker who was a member of the Camden Town Group of Post-Impressionist artists in early 20th-century London. He was an important influence on distinctively British styles of avant-garde art in the mid- and late 20th century. Sickert was a cosmopolitan and eccentric who often favoured ordinary people and urban scenes as his subjects. His work includes portraits of well-known personalities and images derived from press photographs. He is considered a prominent figure in the transition from Impressionism to Modernism. Decades after his death, several researchers and theorists suspected Sickert to have been the London-based serial killer Jack the Ripper, but the theory has largely been dismissed." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Sickert> .

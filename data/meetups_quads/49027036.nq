<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shir_Yaakov> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sam Benjamin \"Shir Yaakov\" Feinstein-Feit (born February 27, 1978) is an American rabbi, composer, liturgist, singer and graphic designer. He currently serves Kol Hai, a Jewish Renewal community based in New Paltz, New York. He received rabbinical ordination in January 2020 from Aleph: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, the Jewish Renewal umbrella organization formed under the spiritual guidance of Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi during the 1990s. Since 2015, Shir Yaakov has led Kol Hai. From 2008 to 2012, he served as Musical Director at Romemu, the Manhattan congregation led by Rabbi David Ingber, who was also a student of Schachter-Shalomi. Earlier still, Shir Yaakov co-founded and led the Kol Zimrah minyan on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. While he records and performs primarily as a singer-songwriter, he has also worked with Darshan and The Epichorus. In 2016, his song Broken-Hearted, based on a verse from Psalm 147, won first place in the 2016 Soundtrack of our Spirit competition organized by the venerable Jewish-American media company The Forward. A number of his compositions remain in regular liturgical use at Romemu and other congregations in the US. Feit's graphic design talents have been employed to design prayerbooks now in use at Romemu. He has also done the CD art (and lyric booklets) for Darshan's CD's. He is married and the father of three daughters." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shir_Yaakov> .

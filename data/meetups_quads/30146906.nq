<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hassan_Musa> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Born in 1951 in El Nuhud, Sudan and currently working in Domessargues, France; Hassan Musa is one of the Sudanese pioneers in contemporary art and zoomorphic calligraphy. Musa’s artworks are known to adapt, mix and combine diverse styles from contrasting parts of the world: his stylistic inspirations are rooted from European painting, Arabic calligraphy and Chinese watercolor. Musa’s paintings gather printed textiles which are utilized as canvas. Its theme habitually appropriates classical Western artworks to approach and challenge well-known figures such as Osama bin Laden, Che Guevara, Vincent van Gogh or Josephine Baker. One of the most well-known statements of the artist is “Images are like blows: we receive them, we give them back. We transmit violent things because that is the way we receive them. It's a way to survive, my images are my line of defense”. Musa here elaborates on how he uses his interpretation on western politics, culture and art to revive images present in the world through giving it back to the people." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hassan_Musa> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melania_Trump> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Melania Trump (/məˈlɑːniə/ mə-LAH-nee-ə; born Melanija Knavs [mɛˈlaːnija ˈknaːws], Germanized as Melania Knauss [meˈlaːni̯a ˈknaʊs]; born April 26, 1970) is a Slovene-American former model and businesswoman who served as First Lady of the United States from 2017 to 2021, as the wife of 45th President Donald Trump. Melania grew up in Slovenia (then part of Yugoslavia), and worked as a fashion model through agencies in the European fashion capitals of Milan and Paris, before moving to New York City in 1996. She was represented by Irene Marie Models and Trump Model Management. In 2005, she married the real estate developer and TV personality Donald Trump and gave birth to their son Barron in 2006. Later that year, she became an American naturalized citizen. She is the second naturalized woman—after Louisa Adams—and the first non-native English speaker to become first lady." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melania_Trump> .

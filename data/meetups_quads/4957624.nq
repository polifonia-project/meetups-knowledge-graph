<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Davis_(snooker_player)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mark Davis (born 12 August 1972) is an English professional snooker player from St Leonards in Sussex. He became professional in 1991, and for many years was considered something of a journeyman; however, he vastly improved his game in the late 2000s, and as a result in 2012 made his debut in the top 16. The highlights of his career so far have been winning the Benson & Hedges Championship in 2002 (earning him an appearance at the Masters), and the six-red snooker world championships three times (in 2009, 2012 and 2013). Davis reached his first ranking event final in 2018, losing to Stuart Bingham in the final of the English Open. Prior to this he was widely considered to be the best player never to have reached a ranking final. Davis is the second-oldest snooker player to make an official maximum break of 147 points in a professional competition, at the age of 44 years and 202 days. He broke his own previous record of 44 years and 151 days, making his second maximum break 51 days after his first." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Davis_(snooker_player)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Schlissel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mark Steven Schlissel (born November 24, 1957) is an American medical scientist and academic administrator who served as the 14th president of the University of Michigan from 2014 to 2022. Schlissel's initial contract with the University of Michigan lasted five years, and he received a second five-year contract, which was due to expire in 2024. He had planned to step down as president in 2023, but was fired by the University of Michigan Board of Regents on January 15, 2022 for interacting with a coworker in a way that was \"inconsistent with promoting the dignity and reputation of the University of Michigan.\" The Regents further alleged that Schlissel was involved \"in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee,\" although they did not specify the nature of the relationship or reveal details of any investigation that led them to that conclusion. He holds both a professorship of microbiology and immunology and a professorship of internal medicine within the University of Michigan Health System as well as a professorship of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology in the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Schlissel> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wendy_Sandler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wendy Sandler is an American-Israeli linguist who is known for her research on the phonology of Sign Languages. Sandler earned her PhD in linguistics from the University of Texas at Austin in 1987, with a dissertation entitled \"Sequentiality and simultaneity in American Sign Language.\" A revised version of her dissertation was published in 1989 under the title, \"Phonological Representation of the Sign: Linearity and Nonlinearity in Sign Language Phonology.\" After her dissertation, Sandler took up a position at the University of Haifa, Israel, where she became a Professor of Linguistics in the Department of English Language and Literature. She was also the Founding Director of the Sign Language Research Lab there. Sandler has co-written a book on Israeli Sign Language with Irit Meir (Meir & Sandler 2007). With Diane Lillo-Martin, she has co-authored a standard linguistic introduction to the phonology and syntax of American Sign Language (Sandler & Lillo-Martin 2006). In collaboration with Mark Aronoff, Irit Meir and Carol Padden, Sandler has made fundamental contributions to the investigation of the emergence of language with her research on Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language. This research is featured in Talking Hands, by Margalit Fox. In December 2017, Sandler won a prize of 150,000 Israeli new shekels from Mifal HaPayis for her conceptual research systems while following new sign languages which are being converted into functional communication, including a sign language of a Bedouin community in Israel. During 2014â€“2018, Sandler led a European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant entitled, \"The Grammar of the Body: Revealing the Foundations of Compositionality in Human Language\" (GRAMBY)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wendy_Sandler> .

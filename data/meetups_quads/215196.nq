<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Surtees> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Surtees, CBE (11 February 1934 â€“ 10 March 2017) was a British Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and Formula One driver. On his way to become a seven-time Grand Prix motorcycle World Champion, he won his first title in 1956, and followed with three consecutive doubles between 1958 and 1960, winning six World Championships in both the 500 and 350cc classes. Surtees then made the move to the pinnacle of Motorsport, the Formula 1 World Championship, and in 1964 made motor racing history by becoming the F1 World Champion. To this day Surtees remains the only person to have won World Championships on both two and four wheels. He founded the Surtees Racing Organisation team that competed as a constructor in Formula One, Formula 2 and Formula 5000 from 1970 to 1978. He was also the ambassador of the Racing Steps Foundation. As of 2022, John Surtees is the last British Ferrari World Champion." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Surtees> .

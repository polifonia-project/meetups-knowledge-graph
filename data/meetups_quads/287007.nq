<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Costa-Gavras> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Costa-Gavras (short for Konstantinos Gavras; Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Γαβράς; born 12 February 1933) is a Greek-French film director, screenwriter, and producer who lives and works in France. He is known for films with political and social themes, such as the political thriller Z (1969), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and Missing (1982), for which he won the Palme d'Or and an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Most of his films have been made in French; however, six of them were made in English. His film Z was the first film, and one of the few, to be nominated for both the Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Costa-Gavras> .

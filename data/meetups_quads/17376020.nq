<http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Zorro_(wrestler)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jesús Cristóbal Martínez Rodriguez (born July 25, 1975) is a Mexican luchador (professional wrestler) who is best known as El Zorro. His gimmick started out very similar to the fictional character Zorro complete with mask, but in recent years it has evolved and the mask has been eliminated. He is best known for his work in the Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) promotion in Mexico, where he is a former AAA Mega Champion. He has in the past worked both in Europe, Japan and made a few brief appearances for the World Wrestling Federation show WWF Super Astros. He was the \"Deputy leader\" of the La Legión Extranjera faction headed by Konnan. In December 2012, Martínez was repackaged as La Parka Negra, the storyline nemesis of La Parka. He returned as El Zorro in October 2013, before departing the company in February 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/El_Zorro_(wrestler)> .

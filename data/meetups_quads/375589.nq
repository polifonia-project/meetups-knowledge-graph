Marsden's books have been translated into eleven languages. While working as a teacher, Marsden began writing for children, and had his first book, So Much to Tell You, published in 1987. Since then, he has written or edited over 40 books and has sold over 5 million books throughout the world. In 2006, Marsden started an alternative school, Candlebark School in the Macedon Ranges. Marsden has since reduced his writing to focus on teaching and running the school. In 2016, he opened the arts-focused secondary school, , also in the Macedon Ranges. He is also the patron of youth media organisation Express Media. He has no academic education in pedagogy and is not state licenced." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Marsden_(writer)> .

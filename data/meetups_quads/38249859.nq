The artist went by the title \"The Crown Prince of Hell.\" He operated and curated the Vector Gallery in New York City, which drew attention and critical response for its avant-garde postmodern multimedia narratives on Abrahamic religions. The gallery attracted controversy as “The official art gallery of Satan” and purported to operate as a sovereign nation with its own time zone, theology, and community of adherents, Vectorians. Some refer to the gallery as a cult, and to Brine in turn as a cult leader. In an interview with V Magazine, Brine clarified that Vector is not a cult. \"We're really a group of close friends. We have the same religion, but we practice it differently. The practice of our religion is making art.\" Brine & the Vector Gallery were often likened to a Millennial Andy Warhol meets GG Allin. The NYC location closed when Brine traveled to Tanna, Vanuatu and opened for a period on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles. The press reported Brine’s intentions to move Vector from LA to Washington, DC during the American presidential election season. The final incarnation of the Vector Gallery opened in the fall of 2017 at 951 Grand Street in Brooklyn and closed in September 2018." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/JJ_Brine> .

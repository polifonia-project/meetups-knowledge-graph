<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Humphreys> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul David Humphreys (born 27 February 1960) is an English singer, songwriter and musician who is best known for his contributions to Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), a new wave band which he founded alongside Andy McCluskey in 1978. John Doran in The Quietus remarked: \"If, roughly speaking, McCluskey is the intellect and inquisitive nature in the group, then Humphreys is the heart.\" Humphreys provided synthesizer/keyboard work and vocals from the band's inception in 1978 until his 1989 departure, seven years before their dissolution, and returned for their 2006 reformation. Despite this period of absence, his songwriting contribution features on all of the group's studio albums, save for 1991's Sugar Tax. Humphreys sang lead vocals on several OMD tracks, including the singles \"Electricity\", \"Souvenir\", \"Never Turn Away\", \"Secret\", \"(Forever) Live and Die\" and \"What Have We Done\". He fronted spin-off band the Listening Pool from 1989 to 1996, and recorded with former Propaganda singer Claudia Br√ºcken as the duo Onetwo from 2000 to 2013." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Humphreys> .

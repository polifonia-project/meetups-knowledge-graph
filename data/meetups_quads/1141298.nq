<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leila_Hyams> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Leila Hyams (May 1, 1905 â€“ December 4, 1977) was an American film and stage actress, model, and vaudevillian, who came from a show business family. Her relatively short film career began in 1924 during the era of silent films and ended in 1936 (excepting a 1946 short film appearance). She started out her career as a vaudevillian, stage performer and model, before embarking on a career in film, and although her career in this genre only lasted around twelve years, the blonde blue-eyed ingenue and leading lady appeared in more than 50 film roles and remained a press favourite, with numerous magazine covers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leila_Hyams> .

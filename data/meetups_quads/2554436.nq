<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Axelrod_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Axelrod (April 17, 1931 â€“ February 5, 2017) was an American composer, arranger, and producer. After starting out as a staff producer for record companies specializing in jazz, Axelrod became known by the mid-1960s in soul and jazz circles for his recording skills. In 1968, Axelrod embarked on a solo career and released several albums during the 1970s that showcased his characteristic sound, which combined heavily microphoned drums and baroque orchestration, and avant garde themes ranging from the environment to heightened mental awareness. With his early solo projects, Axelrod was one of the first recording artists to fuse elements of jazz, rock, and R&B. One of his most important records, Song of Innocence (1968), featured instrumental interpretations of 18th-century poet William Blake's poetry collection of the same name done in a contemporary musical vein, leading one critic at the time to coin the term \"jazz fusion\" and numerous hip hop producers to sample the album's music decades later." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Axelrod_(musician)> .

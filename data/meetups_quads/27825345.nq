Rodriguez (November 5, 1962 – February 14, 1997) was a Filipino actor and model. He got his start in show business when he was discovered by the filmmaker, a National Artist for Film, Lino Brocka, who cast him in a Close Up commercial in 1981. Often referred to as the \"Filipino Christopher Reeve\", he was most famous for his roles on the television sitcom Palibhasa Lalake and opposite Sharon Cuneta in the 1983 movie To Love Again. He was nominated three times—1995, 1989, and 1986 respectively as Best Supporting Actor in the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Awards (also known as the FAMAS Awards) for the films The Elsa Castillo Story (1994), Ibulong Mo sa Diyos (1988), and Partida (1985). He won the award in 1989 for playing the role of Mario Umali—a dance choreographer who raped the main protagonist, Monica Quijano (played by Vilma Santos)—in Ibulong Mo sa Diyos." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miguel_Rodriguez_(actor)> .

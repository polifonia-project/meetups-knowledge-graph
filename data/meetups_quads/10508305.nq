He is the son of noted modernist architect Desmond Williams and the twin brother of bandmate Jez. Andy and Jez were born in Manchester, England and have a brother Dominic and sister Sarah. Before forming Doves, the band's three members were a dance-club music trio called Sub Sub. While Doves were on a hiatus between 2010 and 2020, Andy and Jez Williams formed a side project called Black Rivers, releasing a self-titled album in February 2015. Andy sings occasional backing vocals and also lead vocals on some songs; \"Melody Calls\" and the verses of \"Here It Comes\" from Lost Souls, \"M62 Song\" from The Last Broadcast, the B-sides \"Hit the Ground Running\", \"45\" (verses) & \"At The Tower\" (chorus), \"Shadows of Salford\" from Some Cities and the verses of \"Blue Water\" from the special edition of The Places Between: The Best of Doves. Andy plays the harmonica on \"Here It Comes\". He also plays the melodica during live acoustic versions of \"Snowden\" (see: \"Snowden\" live at Waterloo Records, Texas)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andy_Williams_(drummer)> .

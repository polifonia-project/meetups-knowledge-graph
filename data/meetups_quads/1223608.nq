She is noted for her distinctive contralto voice and also plays percussion during live shows. She is the younger sister of the late guitarist Ricky Wilson (1953â€“1985), who was also a founding member of the band. In addition to her work with the B-52's, Wilson has released two solo EPs, Sunrise (2016) and Supernatural (2017). In late 2017, she released her debut solo album, Change, via the independent label Kill Rock Stars." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cindy_Wilson> .

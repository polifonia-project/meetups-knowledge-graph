The press describes him as \"a musical bridge to many cultures\" and \"a thinking musician, constantly endeavouring to carry his instrument beyond conventional boundaries\". His music is \"an experience that is not aimed at titillating the senses, but to seize the soul\". A protege of Ravi Shankar, he is acknowledged by critics and connoisseurs alike as a worthy successor to his teacher's tradition. He is a classical musician, as well as a collaborator, working with musicians from different genres across the world. He has performed at prestigious venues and festivals like the Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall, Broadway, the Sydney Opera House, the National Arts Festival, the Theatre de la Ville, Dover Lane Music Conference, and St. Xavier's college Ahmedabad to name a few." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shubhendra_Rao> .

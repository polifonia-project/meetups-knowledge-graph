<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gloria_Taylor_(patient)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gloria Taylor (c. 1948 â€“ October 4, 2012) was a Canadian who was an advocate of medically-assisted dying and suffered from Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Taylor began to experience the early symptoms of ALS in 2003. A neurologist diagnosed her disease in 2009. On June 29, 2011, Taylor filed an application with the Supreme Court of British Columbia asking to be added as a plaintiff in the BC Civil Liberties Association's (BCCLA) death with dignity lawsuit. The BCCLA had filed the lawsuit in April 2011 to challenge the laws that make it a criminal offense to assist seriously and incurably ill individuals to die with dignity. The legal challenge seeks to allow seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults the right to receive medical assistance to hasten death under certain specific safeguards. This case is known as Carter v Canada (AG)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gloria_Taylor_(patient)> .

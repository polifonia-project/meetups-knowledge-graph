The project to calculate the representations of E8 has been compared to the Human Genome Project in scope. Together with and David Vogan, he co-authored a monograph on a geometric approach to the Langlands classification and Arthur's conjectures in the real case. He completed his Ph.D. at Yale University under the supervision of Gregg Zuckerman in 1981.In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeffrey_Adams_(mathematician)> .

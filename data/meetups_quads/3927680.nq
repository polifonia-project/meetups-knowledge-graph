<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Ockrent> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Robert Ockrent (18 June 1946 â€“ 2 December 1999) was a British stage director, well-known both for his Broadway musicals and smaller niche plays. He was educated at Highgate School. Through directing Educating Rita, The Nerd and Follies, he became an established figure in London theatre. In 1986 he made a successful transition to New York City with Me and My Girl that earned several Tony Award . In later life Ockrent worked in film, mainly straight-to-TV movies. In 1992 Ockrent worked with Susan Stroman on Crazy for You and other productions. They were married in 1996 and remained so until Ockrent's death from leukaemia in New York in 1999. Ockrent's son is the screenwriter and director Ben Ockrent. A charitable trust now exists in his name. The trust aims to give access to theatre for children with cancer, involving nights at the theatre with visits backstage afterwards. It also funds leukaemia research, \"both mainstream and 'alternative'\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Ockrent> .

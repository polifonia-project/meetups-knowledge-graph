<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace_Smith_(poet)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Horace (born Horatio) Smith (31 December 1779 â€“ 12 July 1849) was an English poet and novelist. In 1818, he participated in a sonnet-writing competition with Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was of Smith that Shelley said: \"Is it not odd that the only truly generous person I ever knew who had money enough to be generous with should be a stockbroker? He writes poetry and pastoral dramas and yet knows how to make money, and does make it, and is still generous.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace_Smith_(poet)> .

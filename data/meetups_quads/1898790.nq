<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulnara_Karimova> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gulnara Islamovna Karimova (Cyrillic Uzbek: Гулнора Исломовна Каримова; Russian: Гульнара Исламовна Каримова, Gul'nara Islamovna Karimova; born 8 July 1972) is the elder daughter of Islam Karimov, the president of Uzbekistan from 1991 to his death in 2016. She wielded considerable influence in Uzbekistan owing to her business dealings and family connections. From 2013, due to a conflict with her father, she began to rapidly lose influence. Karimova was placed under house arrest in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in November 2014. She was questioned by Swiss prosecutors in December 2016 in a money-laundering investigation. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Treasury banned United States entities from dealing with Karimova or any of her organisations or associates. Also in the same year, she was sentenced in Uzbekistan to 10 years in jail for fraud and money laundering. In 2018, the sentence was commuted to five-year house arrest. In March 2019 she was sent to prison for allegedly violating the terms of her house arrest." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gulnara_Karimova> .

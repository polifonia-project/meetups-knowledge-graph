<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuoba_Yu> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tuoba Yu (拓拔余) (died 29 October 452), formally Prince Yin of Nan'an (南安隱王), Xianbei name Kebozhen (可博真), was briefly an emperor of the Xianbei-led Chinese Northern Wei dynasty. He was placed on the throne by the eunuch Zong Ai after Zong assassinated his father Emperor Taiwu in spring 452, and Zong was largely in control of the regime during his reign. Later in the year, when Tuoba Yu tried to assert his own authority, Zong had him assassinated as well, but then was overthrown by a group of officials, who put Tuoba Yu's nephew Tuoba Jun (the son of Tuoba Yu's older brother, Tuoba Huang the Crown Prince, who had predeceased their father) on the throne as Emperor Wencheng." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuoba_Yu> .

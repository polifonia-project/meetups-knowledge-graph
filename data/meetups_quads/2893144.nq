<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sven-Ole_Thorsen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sven-Ole Thorsen (born 24 September 1944) is a Danish actor, stuntman, bodybuilder and strongman competitor. Thorsen won Denmark's Strongest Man in 1983. Using his stature he often plays imposing giants and villains in his films who are somehow beaten by smaller opponents in a David and Goliath manner, but he has also played heroic characters such as Gunnar the legendary warrior in The Viking Sagas. His autobiography (Strong Man in Hollywood) was published on 26 October 2007, and was very well reviewed. The first printing of the book reportedly sold out in 24 hours." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sven-Ole_Thorsen> .

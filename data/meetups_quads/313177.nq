<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyanendra_of_Nepal> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gyanendra Shah (Nepali: ज्ञानेन्द्र शाह, born 7 July 1947) is a former monarch who was the last King of Nepal, reigning from 2001 to 2008. As a child, he was briefly king from 1950 to 1951, when his grandfather, Tribhuvan, took political asylum in India with the rest of his family. His second reign began after the 2001 Nepalese royal massacre. Gyanendra Shah is the first person in the history of Nepal to be king twice and also the last king of the Shah dynasty of Nepal. Gyanendra's second reign was marked by constitutional turmoil. His brother King Birendra had established a constitutional monarchy in which he delegated policy to a representative government. The growing insurgency of the Nepalese Civil War during Gyanendra's reign interfered with elections of representatives. After several delays in elections, Gyanendra suspended the constitution and assumed direct authority in February 2005, asserting that it would be a temporary measure to suppress the Maoist insurgency after civil governments had failed to do so. In the face of broad opposition, he restored the previous parliament in April 2006. He was deposed two years later by the first session of the Constituent Assembly, which declared the nation as the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal and abolished the 240-year Shah Dynasty." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyanendra_of_Nepal> .

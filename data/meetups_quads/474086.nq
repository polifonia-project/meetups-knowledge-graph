<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Takuya_Kimura> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Takuya Kimura (Japanese: 木村 拓哉, Hepburn: Kimura Takuya, born November 13, 1972) is a Japanese actor, singer, and radio personality. He is regarded as a Japanese icon after achieving success as an actor. He was also a popular member of SMAP, one of the best-selling boy bands in Asia. A 1996 television drama series, Long Vacation, in which he landed his first lead role, became a massive success, creating a phrase called the \"Lon-bake phenomenon\". He was given the title, \"The King of Ratings\", as his subsequent television series continued to generate high ratings and each show became a social phenomenon as it aired. Five of his works are ranked in the 10 best-viewed TV drama series in Japan, the highest of which is his 2001 drama series, Hero. He also starred in blockbuster films, including Love and Honor (2006), Hero (2007) and Howl's Moving Castle (as a voice actor, 2004). Kimura is also known for his work in the video games Judgment and Lost Judgment, portraying Takayuki Yagami." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Takuya_Kimura> .

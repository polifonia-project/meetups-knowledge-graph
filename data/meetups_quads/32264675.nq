<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ramon_Ortiz_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ramón Ortiz (June 15, 1970) is a Puerto Rican guitarist and composer, best known as a founding member and director of the progressive metal band Puya, the heavy metal band Ankla and his solo project ORTIZ. Ramón is a visionary and pioneer of the Latin metal movement internationally. His music is a fusion that blends the power of guitar driven heavy rock and metal with the syncopated beats of Afro-Caribbean music. As once stated by Peavey amplification: \"his music is an exercise in contrast and control, like a fist inside a velvet glove. Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, he started the guitar at age seven. Son and grandson of the guitar and the Puerto Rican cuatro. He studied classical guitar at the Music Conservatory of Puerto Rico during his adolescence.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ramon_Ortiz_(musician)> .

He was the 19th president of Liberia and the longest-serving president in the country's history, serving from his election in 1944 until his death in 1971. Tubman is regarded as the \"father of modern Liberia\" in that during his presidency sufficient foreign investment was attracted to modernize the country's economy and infrastructure. During his tenure, Liberia experienced a period of prosperity. He also led a policy of national unification in order to reduce the social and political differences between his fellow Americo-Liberians and the indigenous Liberians." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Tubman> .

He was involved in negotiations between the settler government and Māori from 1844 to 1861, eventually as Native Secretary and Land Purchase commissioner. He was one of the most influential figures in Māori-Pākehā relations in the mid-1800s and was involved in the dispute over the \"Waitara Purchase\", which led up to the First Taranaki War." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_McLean_(New_Zealand_politician)> .

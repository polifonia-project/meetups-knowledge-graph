<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Beckett> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joshua Patrick Beckett (born May 15, 1980) is an American former professional baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). A three-time MLB All-Star, he played for the Florida Marlins, the Boston Red Sox, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. After a stellar high school career in which he was regarded as one of the top baseball prospects in the U.S., Beckett was drafted by the Marlins with the second overall pick in the 1999 MLB draft. He won the 2003 World Series with the Marlins and the 2007 World Series with the Red Sox, receiving the 2003 World Series MVP award and the 2007 American League Championship Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. Beckett was traded from the Marlins to the Red Sox in 2006 and from the Red Sox to the Dodgers in 2012, both as part of multi-player transactions. Beckett recovered from a serious injury that caused him to miss most of the 2013 season. He pitched a no-hitter for the Dodgers against the Philadelphia Phillies on May 25, 2014, becoming the 19th man in Dodgers history to pitch a no-hitter. However, his season was again cut short due to an injury, and he announced his retirement on October 7, 2014." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josh_Beckett> .

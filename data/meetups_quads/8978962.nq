He has cited guitarists John Petrucci and Paul Gilbert as some of his main inspirations. Shekoski is also known for his guitar playing style onstage, including \"guitar spins,\" which involves spinning his guitar over his left shoulder multiple times, subsequently catching it mid-air, and continuing to play." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Justin_Shekoski> .

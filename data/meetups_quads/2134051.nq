<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bregowine> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bregowine (died August 764) was a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury. Little is known of his origins or his activities as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge of his time in office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12th century." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bregowine> .

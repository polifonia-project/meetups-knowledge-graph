<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wade_Barrett> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stuart Alexander Bennett (born 10 August 1980) is an English-American professional wrestling commentator, actor, and former professional wrestler who holds both British and American citizenship. He is currently signed to WWE, where he is a color commentator on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Wade Barrett. Under the Wade Barrett name, he won the first season of NXT in 2010 and made his main roster debut on Raw later that year. He rose to prominence as the leader of The Nexus, a villainous faction composed of the remaining NXT first season rookies. He headlined five PPV events for WWE in 2010—SummerSlam, Night of Champions, Bragging Rights, Survivor Series, and TLC—three of which saw him unsuccessfully challenge for the WWE Championship. He later formed The Corre, a short-lived group with former Nexus members Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel, along with Ezekiel Jackson in 2011. After they disbanded, Barrett would go on to become a five-time Intercontinental Champion. In 2013, Barrett's ring name was changed to Bad News Barrett and he adopted the character of a man who took immense pleasure in breaking bad news to other people. In 2015, he won the 20th King of the Ring tournament, at which point his ring name was changed to King Barrett. He was notably portrayed as a villain for his entire WWE career, regardless of any other changes made to his character. He has not wrestled since leaving WWE in May 2016, though he has appeared in non-wrestling roles on the international independent circuit, such as a commentator for World of Sport Wrestling and a general manager for Defiant Wrestling under his real name. He returned to WWE as a commentator for NXT in August 2020. Bennett made his acting debut in the action film Dead Man Down (2013) and has since starred in action films such as Eliminators (2016), I Am Vengeance (2018), and I Am Vengeance: Retaliation (2020)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wade_Barrett> .

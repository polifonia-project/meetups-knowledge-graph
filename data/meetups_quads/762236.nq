He is known to have expanded the tuba’s known capacities in jazz. Johnson was known for his extensive work as a sideman, notably with George Gruntz, Hank Crawford, and Gil Evans. As a leader, he fronted the tuba ensemble Gravity and released three albums during the 1990s for Verve Records; the first Arrival, was a tribute to Pharoah Sanders." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Howard_Johnson_(jazz_musician)> .

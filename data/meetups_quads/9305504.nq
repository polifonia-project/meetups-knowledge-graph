Following the breakup of that band, he continued to collaborate with Lloyd Cole early in the singer's solo career, playing and co-writing on 1990s Lloyd Cole and 1991's Don't Get Weird on Me Babe. He has since performed on other artists' recordings, including Del Amitri, Texas, the Hot Rod Cadets, the Kevin McDermott Orchestra, and Alisdair Robertson. His collaboration with Alisdair resulted in the album Confessions of a Justified Singer. He plays piano, keyboards, accordion, and melodica. In the 1990s, Cowan was a member and co-producer of Paul Quinn and the Independent Group on the revived Postcard Records. In 2007 Blair played in Kevin McDermott's album, Wise to the Fade. In 2010, Blair collaborated on Lloyd Cole's Broken Record, co-writing \"Oh Genevieve\".

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michelle_Leslie> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michelle Leslie (born 1981), who previously worked under the name Michelle Lee, is an Australian interior designer and former model. Leslie gained prominence as a catwalk model in 2000, working for stores including David Jones. That same year, she was a finalist on the television series Search for a Supermodel and the runner-up for Miss World Australia. In 2005, Leslie was arrested in Bali after police reported discovering two ecstasy tablets in her handbag. She was convicted and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Upon returning to Australia, Leslie stated police had planted the drugs in her bag and then demanded a US$25,000 bribe to avoid going to prison, which she could not afford to pay. While in custody, Leslie dressed in Islamic clothing, stating she did so to shield herself from both the media and sexual assault from corrections officers. The decision faced a backlash from some Muslims, who accused her of using Islam as a stunt to gain the court's favour. Leslie's arrest and her choice of clothing in custody resulted in considerable attention from the Australian media. After returning to Australia, Leslie travelled to Cambodia to help raise money for local orphanages. She returned to the catwalk in Australia in 2006, but struggled to find regular work as a model following the publicity from her arrest. In 2007, she launched a line of clothing for dogs, and the following year, began a career as an interior designer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michelle_Leslie> .

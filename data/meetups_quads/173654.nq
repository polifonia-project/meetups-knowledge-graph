<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Fricke> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ron Fricke (born February 24, 1953) is an American film director and cinematographer, specializing in time-lapse photography and large format cinematography. He was the director of photography for Koyaanisqatsi (1982) and directed the purely cinematic non-verbal non-narrative feature Baraka (1992). He designed and used his own 65 mm camera equipment for Baraka and his later projects. He also directed the IMAX films Chronos (1985) and (1986). He also worked as cinematographer for parts of the film Star Wars: Episode III â€“ Revenge of the Sith (he was hired to shoot the eruption of Mount Etna in Sicily for use in scenes of the volcanic planet Mustafar). The sequel to Baraka, Samsara, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2011, and had its U.S. premiere on August 24, 2012. Fricke writes about his work: I feel that my work has evolved through Koyaanisqatsi, Chronos and Baraka. Both technically and philosophically I am ready to delve even deeper into my favorite theme: humanity's relationship to the eternal." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ron_Fricke> .

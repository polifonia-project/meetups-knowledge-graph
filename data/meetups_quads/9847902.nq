He compiled a 12–14–2 record including a 40–27 loss to Texas in the 1946 Cotton Bowl Classic. During that time, he also served as the school's track coach. He himself, was a football player at Missouri. With Faurot's return in 1946 Simpson reverted to his pre-war position as an assistant football coach. He was also the institution's long-time golf coach before retiring in the 1960s. He was the younger brother of hurdler and track coach Robert Simpson." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chauncey_Simpson> .

While studying at Oxford, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Middlesex at Oxford in 1924. He made two further appearances in first-class cricket, making a further appearance for Oxford against the Free Foresters in 1925, before playing against Oxford for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Eastbourne in 1926. He scored 57 runs in his three first-class matches, with a high score of 21. He later served in the Second World War with the Royal Air Force, enlisting as a pilot officer in August 1940. He was promoted to the rank of flight lieutenant in November 1941, while in January 1943 he was made a temporary squadron leader. He resigned his commission nine years after the conclusion of the war, in July 1954, retaining the rank of squadron leader.

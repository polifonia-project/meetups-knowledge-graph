<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baldwin_V_of_Jerusalem> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Baldwin V (1177 or 1178 â€“ August 1186) was King of Jerusalem who reigned together with his uncle Baldwin IV from 1183 to 1185 and, after his uncle's death, as the sole king from 1185 to his death. Baldwin IV's leprosy meant that he could not have children, and so he spent his reign grooming various relatives to succeed him. Finally his nephew was chosen, and Baldwin IV had him crowned as co-king in order to sideline the child's unpopular stepfather, Guy of Lusignan. When Baldwin IV died, Count Raymond III of Tripoli assumed government on behalf of the child king. He died of unknown causes, and was succeeded by his mother, Sibylla, who then made Guy king." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baldwin_V_of_Jerusalem> .

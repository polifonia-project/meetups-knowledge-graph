<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clare_Bronfman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Clare Bronfman (born 1979) is an American heiress, convicted felon and former leader of NXIVM, a multi-level marketing company and cult based near Albany, New York. She is the youngest daughter of billionaire philanthropist and former Seagram liquor chairman Edgar Bronfman Sr. After a brief equestrian career, Bronfman began involvement in NXIVM, a business engaged in criminal activities during 1998â€“2018, which led to indictments on federal charges, including sex trafficking. In April 2019, Bronfman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbor illegal aliens for financial gain, and to fraudulent use of identification. The prosecution requested a sentence of five years in prison. In September 2020, Judge Nicholas Garaufis sentenced Bronfman to six years and nine months imprisonment." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clare_Bronfman> .

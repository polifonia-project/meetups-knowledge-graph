<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vashti_Bunyan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jennifer Vashti Bunyan (born 1945) is an English singer-songwriter. Beginning her career in the mid-1960s, she released her debut album, Just Another Diamond Day, in 1970. The album sold very few copies and Bunyan, discouraged, abandoned her musical career. By 2000, her album had acquired a cult following; it was re-released and Bunyan recorded more songs, initiating the second phase of her musical career after a gap of thirty years. She subsequently released two more albums: Lookaftering in 2005, and Heartleap in 2014." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vashti_Bunyan> .

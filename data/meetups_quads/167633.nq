<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladys_Cooper> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dame Gladys Constance Cooper, DBE (18 December 1888 â€“ 17 November 1971) was an English actress, theatrical manager and producer, whose career spanned seven decades on stage, in films and on television. Beginning as a teenager in Edwardian musical comedy and pantomime, she starred in dramatic roles and silent films before the First World War. She managed the Playhouse Theatre from 1917 to 1934, where she starred in many roles. From the early 1920s Cooper won praise in plays by W. Somerset Maugham and others. In the 1930s she starred steadily in productions both in London's West End and on Broadway. Moving to Hollywood in 1940, Cooper found success in a variety of character roles. She received three Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, for performances in The Song of Bernadette (1943), My Fair Lady (1964) and, most famously, Now, Voyager (1942). Throughout the 1950s and 60s she worked both on stage and on screen, continuing to star on stage until her last year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gladys_Cooper> .

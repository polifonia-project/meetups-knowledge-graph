<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lauder> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Lauder (c.1488 â€“ after February 1560) was Scotland's Public Accuser of Heretics. He was twice sent to Rome by King James V, to confirm the loyalty of the Scottish crown. As Principal Private Secretary to Cardinal David Beaton, Archbishop of St. Andrews, he successfully prosecuted many heretics, who were burnt at the stake, John Knox testifying to his extreme cruelty. Beaton was eventually murdered by the mob, but Lauder escaped and was later Private Secretary to Archbishop Hamilton (hanged April 1571)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lauder> .

He was originally a member of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and was persuaded by Geoff Stephens to join The New Vaudeville Band, before forming his own combo, Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band. Kerr was a part of a reunited Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band line-up of surviving members, which toured in 2006 and 2008. He and his son, Matt, also operate a t-shirt printing business. Kerr's musical career is described in David Christie's Doo Dah Diaries." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bob_Kerr_(musician)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Bickerton> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Derek Bickerton (March 25, 1926 â€“ March 5, 2018) was an English-born linguist and professor at the University of Hawaii in Manoa. Based on his work in creole languages in Guyana and Hawaii, he has proposed that the features of creole languages provide powerful insights into the development of language both by individuals and as a feature of the human species. He is the originator and main proponent of the language bioprogram hypothesis according to which the similarity of creoles is due to their being formed from a prior pidgin by children who all share a universal human innate grammar capacity. Bickerton also wrote several novels. His novels have been featured in the works of the Sun Ra Revival Post Krautrock Archestra, through spoken word and musical themes." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Derek_Bickerton> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahmadou_Ahidjo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo (24 August 1924 â€“ 30 November 1989) was a Cameroonian politician who was the first President of Cameroon, holding the office from 1960 until 1982. Ahidjo played a major role in Cameroon's independence from France as well as reuniting the French and English-speaking parts of the country. During Ahidjo's time in office, he established a centralized political system. Ahidjo established a single-party state under the Cameroon National Union (CNU) in 1966. In 1972, Ahidjo abolished the federation in favor of a unitary state. Ahidjo resigned from the presidency in 1982, and Paul Biya assumed the presidency. This was an action that was surprising to Cameroonians. Accused of being behind a coup plot against Biya in 1984, Ahidjo was sentenced to death in absentia, but he died of natural causes in 1989." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ahmadou_Ahidjo> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobbi_Kristina_Brown> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bobbi Kristina Houston Brown (March 4, 1993 â€“ July 26, 2015) was an American reality television personality. She was the daughter and only child of singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. Her parents' fame kept Brown in the public eye, as did her appearances on the reality show Being Bobby Brown. Brown intended to become a singer, actress, and dancer like her parents. She performed with her mother at concerts a number of times, as well as singing a cover of her mother's song \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" on Being Bobby Brown. She appeared as herself on a number of television shows and specials, and played a role on Tyler Perry's television series For Better or Worse in 2012. On January 31, 2015, Brown was found unconscious in a bathtub in her home, which was similar to the fate of her mother. After being in a coma for nearly six months, Brown died from lobar pneumonia on July 26, 2015, at the age of 22. After her death, her life was the subject of a television movie in 2017 and a documentary in 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobbi_Kristina_Brown> .

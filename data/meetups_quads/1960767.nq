Stephen Kasner died on December 25, 2019. His longtime friend and fellow Cleveland native, Dwid, from the band Integrity (for which Kasner had provided artwork) posted through Twitter in homage: \"Stephen Kasner was my friend. He will be deeply missed. I hope that his artwork will remind us of his tortured brilliance and haunted vision. May his death serve as a stark reminder of how fragile we can be. To those of you who may be struggling out there, who might feel alone. You are not alone. Stay strong.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Kasner> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilfred_Arthur> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Wilfred Stanley Arthur, DSO, DFC (7 December 1919 – 23 December 2000) was a fighter ace and senior officer of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. Commonly known as \"Woof\", and sometimes \"Wolf\" or \"Wulf\", he was officially credited with ten aerial victories. As a commander, he led combat formations at squadron and wing level, becoming at 24 the youngest group captain in the history of the RAAF. Arthur joined the Air Force the day after Australia declared war in September 1939. He first saw action with No. 3 Squadron in North Africa, where he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for shooting down four aircraft in a single sortie. Posted to the South West Pacific, he commanded first No. 75 Squadron, and later Nos. 81 and 78 Wings. He earned the Distinguished Service Order for continuing to lead an attack on a formation of Japanese bombers after discovering that his guns were inoperable, and was twice mentioned in despatches. Arthur also played a leading part in—and gave name to—the \"Morotai Mutiny\" of April 1945. Pursuing various interests in Australia and Vietnam following his discharge from the Air Force after the war, he died in 2000 at the age of 81." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilfred_Arthur> .

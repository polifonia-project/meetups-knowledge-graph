<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Hayes_(singer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Herbert Hayes (January 5, 1930 – March 10, 2014) was an American singer and actor and, in his latter career, a game show host and talk radio host. Hayes was well known during television's golden age as the unnamed boyfriend opposite his real-real-life wife Peggy Ann Garner to Barbara \"Babs\" Smith on the ABC sitcom Two Girls Named Smith for two seasons in 1951. Hayes was best-known and remembered for his music. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on January 5, 1930, Hayes had much success as a recording artist while in his late teens. Between 1948 and 1953, Hayes had fourteen top 25 hits. That included four top-10 hits recorded and produced during his time at Mercury Records. His most successful record was his rendition of The Old Master Painter which was released in 1949. The song, produced by Mitch Miller, reached no. 2 on the national charts in December 1949 and remained on the charts for twelve weeks until March 1950. In addition to Mercury, Hayes recorded and produced songs for ABC, Decca, Columbia and finally Contempo Records. After leaving Contempo in 1964, Hayes pursued a further career in television making several appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and The Robert Q. Lewis Show. Hayes also was a regular guest on Arthur Godfrey's television and radio series between 1958 and 1972. Hayes was also noted for his military service and career during that time. He was drafted into the military, (Army specifically), in 1953. His rank was second lieutenant. Hayes was stationed at Fort Dix, New Jersey then Governors Island, New York. He served during the Korean War which ended in June 1953, a few months after Hayes' conscription, and the Cold War. The fact that he was in the army and his musical/acting background, Hayes earned a permanent spot as the emcee and co-host with Arlene Francis on the ABC competition series Soldier Parade in 1954. He was hired after the departure of Steve Allen. He remained on the show until its cancellation in June 1955. He also left the army that same year. In the 1970s, Hayes retired from acting and became a game show host. Several game shows he hosted include the syndicated version of Name That Tune from 1970–71 and All About Faces. He also worked as a talk-radio host at several radio stations in Philadelphia and New York City before retiring in 1990. Hayes died on March 10, 2014 at the age of 84 in his home in Los Angeles, California after battling a long illness." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Hayes_(singer)> .

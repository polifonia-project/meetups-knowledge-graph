<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jitendra_Abhisheki> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ganesh Balawant Nawathe, better known as Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki (21 September 1929 â€“ 7 November 1998), was an Indian vocalist, composer and scholar of Indian classical, semi-classical, and devotional music. While he distinguished himself in Hindustani music, he is also credited for the revival of the Marathi musical theatre in the 1960s. Jitendra Abhisheki has been praised as being \"among the stalwarts of Hindustani classical music who mastered other musical forms such as thumri, tappa, bhajan, and bhavgeet. His work in Marathi natyasangeet is well-known.\" An annual Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki Mahotsav is held, and the last was held in mid-October 2018 at the Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagruha in Kothrud, Maharashtra. In Goa, a Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki Music Festival held at the local Kala Academy also reached its 14th edition in 2018." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jitendra_Abhisheki> .

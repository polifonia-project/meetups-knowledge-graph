<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorothy_Beecher_Baker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dorothy Beecher Baker (December 21, 1898 - January 10, 1954) was an American teacher and prominent member of the Baháʼí Faith. She rose to leadership positions in a Local Spiritual Assembly and then was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the religion, serving a total of sixteen years. During World War II, she undertook leadership of the National Assembly's Race Unity Committee and of efforts to expand the religion into Mexico, Central and South America. In December 1951 she was recognized for her service, appointed by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, to the rank of persons known as Hands of the Cause of God. People of this rank were appointed for life whose main function was to propagate and protect the Baháʼí Faith. Unlike the members of the elected institutions and other appointed institutions in the religion, who serve in those offices, Hands are considered to have achieved a distinguished rank in service to the religion. On 24 December 1951 she was appointed Hand of the Cause of God by Shoghi Effendi." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorothy_Beecher_Baker> .

Haas spent his formative years in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, a suburb of Tulsa. He began studying classical piano at age five. He won local and regional piano competitions at a young age. When he was sixteen, he won the Oklahoma Concerto Competition. He performed with the Tulsa Philharmonic. After graduating from high school, he received a scholarship to study classical music at the University of Tulsa, but while in college he became interested in jazz and switched his major. In January 2011 JFJO recorded a suite of music based on the Tulsa Race Riot. Haas signed with Rykodisc/Hyena Records, which released his first album, The Truth About Hollywood (2005), a combination of Hass's compositions and cover versions of songs by Thelonious Monk." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Haas> .

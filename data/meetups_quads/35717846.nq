<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ramy_Essam> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ramy Essam (Arabic: رامي عصام, pronounced [ˈɾɑːmi ʕeˈsˤɑːm]; born 1987 in Mansoura) is an Egyptian musician. He is best known for his appearances in Tahrir Square in Cairo during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Ramy is one of the few singers in Middle East to sing hard rock. In 2011, Ramy was considered the voice of the Egyptian revolution. During the height of the uprising, Ramy performed in front of millions of people in the Tahrir Square. His song Irhal, in which then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was urged to resign, gained popularity among the demonstrators. It became internationally known through YouTube, and is referred to as the anthem of the revolution. In 2011, it was selected by Time Out as the third-most world-changing song of all time. His 2018 song Balaha led to six individuals being arrested in Egypt that were, either correctly or incorrectly, assumed to be connected to Ramy and the song. Among them were the writer of the song, but also a former band member that had not worked on the record. In May 2020 Shady Habash one of the detainees died After being incarcerated for more than two years in pretrial detention. Egypt's public prosecutor has said he mistakenly drank hand sanitiser in his cell, thinking it was water. Ramy's songs were banned in Egypt and he was unable to perform public shows. Since late 2014, Ramy has been living in Finland and Sweden, which gave him again the chance to create and perform freely to spread his message as an ambassador of the Egyptian revolution. During 2016 and 2017, Ramy toured throughout Finland with the theatre monologue RAMY – In the Frontline, which also gathered 5 stars reviews at the Fringe Festival Edinburgh. Ramy stands for gender equality, freedom, social justice, equity, health care, minority rights, education and peace." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ramy_Essam> .

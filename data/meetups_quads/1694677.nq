<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regine_Olsen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Regine Schlegel (née Olsen; 23 January 1822 – 18 March 1904) was a Danish woman who was engaged to the philosopher and theologian Søren Kierkegaard from September 1840 to October 1841. Olsen's relationship with Kierkegaard exerted a crucial influence over his intellectual development, philosophy and theology, and the legacy of their engagement figures prominently in his writings with all of his works except one dedicated to her and crediting her as a reason as to why he became a writer." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regine_Olsen> .

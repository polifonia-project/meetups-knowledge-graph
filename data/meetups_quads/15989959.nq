<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catherine_MacPhail> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Catherine MacPhail (25 January 1946 â€“ 28 August 2021) was a Scottish-born author. Although she had had other jobs, she always wanted to be a writer but she didn't think she would be suited to it. Her first published work was a sort of \"twist-in-the-tale\" story in Titbits, followed by a story in the Sunday Post. After she had won a romantic story competition in Woman's Weekly, she decided to concentrate on romantic novels, but after writing two, she decided that it wasn't right for her.In addition to writing books for children around their teens, she also wrote for adults, she is the author of the BBC Radio 2 series, My Mammy And Me." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catherine_MacPhail> .

She has performed on behalf of special needs children for the nonprofit organization, Jill's House, for critically ill children at the National Institutes of Health Children's Inn, for wounded warriors at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and for retired soldiers at the Veterans' Affairs Center in Washington, D.C.

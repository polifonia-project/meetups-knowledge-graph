After starting her career as a duo with her then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham, releasing the album Buckingham Nicks to little success, Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975, helping the band to become one of the best-selling music acts of all time with over 120 million records sold worldwide. Rumours, the band's second album with Nicks, became one of the best-selling albums worldwide, being certified 20× platinum in the US. In 1981, while remaining a member of Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began her solo career, releasing the studio album Bella Donna, which topped the Billboard 200 and has reached multiplatinum status. She has released eight studio solo albums and seven studio albums with Fleetwood Mac, selling a certified total of 65 million copies in the US alone. After the release of her first solo album, Rolling Stone named her the \"Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll\". Nicks was named one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time and one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone. Her Fleetwood Mac songs \"Landslide\", \"Rhiannon\", and \"Dreams\", with the latter being the band's only number one hit in the US, together with her solo hit \"Edge of Seventeen\", have all been included in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. She is the first woman to have been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and then as a solo artist in 2019. Nicks has garnered eight Grammy Award nominations and two American Music Award nominations as a solo artist. She has won numerous awards with Fleetwood Mac, including a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978 for Rumours. The albums Fleetwood Mac, Rumours, and Bella Donna have been included in the \"Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums\" chart by Billboard. Furthermore, Rumours was rated the seventh-greatest album of all time in Rolling Stone's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", as well as the fourth-greatest album by female acts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucinda_Williams> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lucinda Gayle Williams (born January 26, 1953) is an American singer-songwriter and a solo guitarist. She recorded her first two albums: Ramblin' on My Mind (1979) and Happy Woman Blues (1980), in a traditional country and blues style that received critical praise but little public or radio attention. In 1988, she released her third album, Lucinda Williams, to widespread critical acclaim. Widely regarded as \"an Americana classic\", the album also features \"Passionate Kisses\", a song later recorded by Mary Chapin Carpenter for her 1992 album Come On Come On, which garnered Williams her first Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1994. Known for working slowly, Williams' fourth album; Sweet Old World, appeared four years later in 1992. Sweet Old World was met with further critical acclaim, and was voted the 11th best album of 1992 in The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of prominent music critics. Robert Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 6th on his own year-end list, later writing that the album, as well as Lucinda Williams, were \"gorgeous, flawless, brilliant\". Williams' commercial breakthrough came in 1998 with Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, an album presenting a broader scope of songs that fused rock, blues, country and Americana into a distinctive style that remained consistent and commercial in sound. Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, which includes the singles \"Right in Time\" and the Grammy nominated \"Can't Let Go\", became Williams' greatest commercial success to date. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA the following year, and earned her a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, while being universally acclaimed by critics. Williams' follow up album, Essence, appeared in 2001, to further critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming her first Top 40 album on the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 28. Featuring a more downbeat musical tone, with spare, intimate arrangements, Essence earned Williams three Grammy nominations in 2002: Best Contemporary Folk Album, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the title track, and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single \"Get Right with God\", which she won. One of the most celebrated singer-songwriters of her generation, Williams has released a string of albums since that have earned her further critical acclaim and commercial success, including World Without Tears (2003), West (2007), Little Honey (2008), Blessed (2011), Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone (2014), The Ghosts of Highway 20 (2016), and Good Souls Better Angels (2020). Among her various accolades, she has won three Grammy Awards, from 17 nominations, and has received two Americana Awards (one competitive, one honorary), from 11 nominations. Williams ranked No. 97 on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Rock & Roll in 1999, and was named \"America's best songwriter\" by Time magazine in 2002. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked her the 79th greatest songwriter of all time. In 2017, she received the Berklee College of Music Honorary Doctorate of Music Degree, and ranked No. 91 on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time. In 2020, Car Wheels on a Gravel Road ranked No. 97, and Lucinda Williams ranked No. 426, on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. She was inducted into the Austin City Limits Hall of Fame in 2021. That same year, \"Passionate Kisses\" ranked No. 437 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bonnie_Raitt> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bonnie Lynn Raitt (/reɪt/; born November 8, 1949) is an American blues singer and guitarist. In 1971, Raitt released her self-titled debut album. Following this, she released a series of critically acclaimed roots-influenced albums that incorporated elements of blues, rock, folk, and country. She was also a frequent session player and collaborator with other artists, including Warren Zevon, Little Feat, Jackson Browne, The Pointer Sisters, John Prine and Leon Russell. In 1989, after several years of limited commercial success, she had a major hit with her tenth studio album Nick of Time, which included the song of the same name. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It has since been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry. Her following two albums, Luck of the Draw (1991) and Longing in Their Hearts (1994), were multimillion sellers, generating several hit singles, including \"Something to Talk About\", \"Love Sneakin' Up On You\", and the ballad \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" (with Bruce Hornsby on piano). Raitt has received ten competitive Grammy Awards, as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. She was ranked number 50 in Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\", and was placed on the magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". Australian country music artist Graeme Connors has said \"Bonnie Raitt does something with a lyric no one else can do; she bends it and twists it right into your heart.\" In 2000, Raitt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She has also received the Icon Award from the Billboard Women in Music Awards." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Royce \"Boz\" Scaggs (born June 8, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. An early bandmate of Steve Miller in The Ardells and the Steve Miller Band, he began his solo career in 1969, though he lacked a major hit until his 1976 album Silk Degrees peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200, and produced the hit singles \"Lido Shuffle\" and \"Lowdown\". Scaggs produced two more platinum-certified albums in Down Two Then Left and Middle Man, the latter of which produced two top-40 singles \"Breakdown Dead Ahead\" and \"Jojo\". After a hiatus for most of the 1980s, he returned to recording and touring in 1988, joining The New York Rock and Soul Revue and opening the nightclub Slim's, a popular San Francisco music venue until it closed in 2020. He has continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, with his most recent album being 2018's Out of the Blues. Scaggs is credited for helping the formation of Toto. For his 1976 album, Silk Degrees, he hand picked musicians after taking suggestions from several people. These musicians were David Paich, David Hungate, and Jeff Porcaro. The three were already friends and had frequently performed together on other albums, such as Steely Dan's Pretzel Logic. By going on tour with Scaggs, it solidified the prospect of starting a band. Columbia picked up on this talent by offering the new group a contract \"without audition\". Steve Porcaro described this as \"a record deal thrown in our laps\". Paich stated \"I'm not sure if Toto would have happened as soon, or quite the same way, without Silk Degrees\". Their friendship has continued throughout the decades shown by the varying collaborations and concerts performed together. Paich teamed up once more for Scaggs' 2001 album, Dig, where he contributed to 6 out of the 11 songs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duane_Allman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Howard Duane Allman (November 20, 1946 – October 29, 1971) was an American rock guitarist, session musician, and the founder and original leader of the Allman Brothers Band, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Allman began playing the guitar at age 14. He formed the Allman Brothers Band with his brother Gregg in Jacksonville, Florida in 1969, and achieved its greatest success in the early 1970s. Allman is best remembered for his brief but influential tenure in the band and in particular for his expressive slide guitar playing and inventive improvisational skills. A sought-after session musician both before and during his tenure with the band, Duane Allman performed with such established stars as King Curtis, Aretha Franklin, Herbie Mann, Wilson Pickett, and Boz Scaggs. He also contributed greatly to the 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, by Derek and the Dominos. He died following a motorcycle crash in 1971, at the age of 24. In 2003, he was ranked number 2 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, second only to Jimi Hendrix. In 2011, he was ranked number 9. His guitar tone (achieved with a Gibson Les Paul and two 50-watt bass Marshall amplifiers) was named one of the greatest of all time by Guitar Player.Duane Allman's skills as a guitarist were complemented by personal qualities such as his intensity, drive and ability to draw the best out of others in making music. Fans still refer to Allman affectionately by his nickname \"Skydog\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoebe_Snow> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Phoebe Snow (born Phoebe Ann Laub; July 17, 1950 – April 26, 2011) was an American roots music singer-songwriter and guitarist, known for her 1974 and 1975 songs \"San Francisco Bay Blues\", \"Poetry Man\"(hit song), \"Harpo's Blues\", and her credited guest vocals backing Paul Simon on \"Gone at Last\". She recorded \"San Francisco Bay Blues\" also. She was described by The New York Times as a \"contralto grounded in a bluesy growl and capable of sweeping over four octaves.\" Snow also sang numerous commercial jingles for many U.S. products during the 1980s and 1990s, including General Foods International Coffees, Salon Selectives, and Stouffer's. Snow experienced success in Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s with five top 100 albums in that territory. In 1995 she recorded a gospel album with Sisters of Glory." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frankie_Valli> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Francesco Stephen Castelluccio (born May 3, 1934), known professionally as Frankie Valli, is an American singer, known as the frontman of the Four Seasons beginning in 1960. He is known for his unusually powerful lead falsetto voice. Valli scored 29 top 40 hits with the Four Seasons, one top 40 hit under the Four Seasons alias the Wonder Who?, and nine top 40 hits as a solo artist. As a member of the Four Seasons, Valli's number-one hits include \"Sherry\" (1962), \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" (1962), \"Walk Like a Man\" (1963), \"Rag Doll\" (1964) and \"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\" (1975). Valli's recording of the song \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" reached number two in 1967. As a solo artist, Valli scored number-one hits with the songs \"My Eyes Adored You\" (1974) and \"Grease\" (1978). Valli, Tommy DeVito, Nick Massi and Bob Gaudio – the original members of the Four Seasons – were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boz_Scaggs> .

In 2013, McClendon had enlisted the students in his Philosophy of Education classes to help him mine various archives for Donda West’s full body of work: “The students did a wonderful job helping me find all of this archival material. We’re talking her scholarly works, her dissertation, her master’s thesis. We found personal notes of hers, poems of hers, hundreds of hours of her audio speeches. So in those six years, we’re compiling, we’re editing, and having conference calls with Kanye,” McClendon recounted.

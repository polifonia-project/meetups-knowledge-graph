<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brett_Lee> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brett Lee (born 8 November 1976) is an Australian former international cricketer, who played all three formats of the game. During his international career, Lee was recognised as one of the fastest bowlers in the world. In each of his first two years, Lee conceded fewer than 20 runs for every wicket taken, but later recorded figures in the low 30s. He was an athletic fielder and useful lower-order batter, with a batting average exceeding 20 in Test cricket. Lee finished his Test career with 310 wickets, and his One Day International career with 380 wickets. Considered one of the best bowlers of his generation, only Muttiah Muralitharan took more ODI wickets than Lee from 2000-2009. Lee played for the Australian team that won the 2003 World Cup. He played his first Test in 1999 and retired from international cricket on 12 July 2012. He subsequently declined to renew his contract with his home state side New South Wales, but continued to play Twenty20 matches for several seasons after, notably in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League. In January 2015, Lee announced his retirement from all forms of the game, effective at the end of the 2014â€“15 Big Bash League season. He has since found work as a film actor and a Fox Sports commentator." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brett_Lee> .

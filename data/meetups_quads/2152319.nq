A former student of the University of Central Florida, she was Playboy's Playmate of the Month in October 2002. She was photographed by Stephen Wayda. Her involvement with Playboy began when her best friend encouraged her to send pictures of herself to the magazine. Although she was chosen almost immediately as a Playmate, it was a year before she was assigned a month. She was also the German Playboy Playmate of the Month, for January 2003. According to Teri, her father is German and her mother is half-Japanese. She appeared in the 2005 Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion swimsuit calendar as calendar girl of December. The calendar was the inaugural Playmates at Play calendar and it was shot on the grounds of Playboy Mansion in 2004. It was Playboy's first attempt at creating a non-nude swimsuit calendar featuring Playmates similar in style with those from Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. She was also a Barker's Beauty on The Price Is Right from 2002 to 2005. She has appeared in radio commercials as a \"remarkable mouth\" for KDKB and WLZR Harrison was married to Sevendust drummer Morgan Rose and they have a son together.

Born in Colerain, North Carolina, he attended Chowan College. He stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall, weighed 165 pounds (75 kg), and threw and batted right-handed. White began the 1962 season on the Cubs' roster, and he started nine games at shortstop during the month of April, batting only .158 during the month. He later appeared in seven more games, starting five at shortstop, late in May and in early June. Altogether, he collected eight hits in the Majors, including two doubles, and stole three bases. He played 12 seasons of minor league baseball (1952; 1955–1965), with his most successful year also coming in 1962, when he batted .301 with 11 home runs for the Double-A San Antonio Missions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elder_White> .

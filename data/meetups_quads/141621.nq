<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robbie_Ross> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Baldwin Ross (25 May 1869 â€“ 5 October 1918) was a Canadian-British journalist, art critic and art dealer, best known for his relationship with Oscar Wilde, to whom he was a devoted friend and literary executor. A grandson of the Canadian reform leader Robert Baldwin, and son of John Ross and Augusta Elizabeth Baldwin, Ross was a pivotal figure on the London literary and artistic scene from the mid-1890s to his early death, and mentored several literary figures, including Siegfried Sassoon. His open homosexuality, in a period when male homosexual acts were illegal, brought him many hardships." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robbie_Ross> .

She was born in New York City. She performed a radio show in Georgia and entertained troops for United Service Organizations. The three built a significant list of credits, including many songs recorded by Elvis Presley. The majority of their tunes were used in Presley's musicals. Their work was also credited in the American version of Osamu Tezuka's anime \"Kimba the White Lion\" (1965). The only hit song by the trio was Elvis' \"(You're the) Devil in Disguise\", in 1963. The following films included songs composed by Kaye et al. \n* Double Trouble \n* Easy Come, Easy Go \n* Follow That Dream \n* Frankie and Johnny \n* Fun in Acapulco \n* Girl Happy \n* Girls! Girls!

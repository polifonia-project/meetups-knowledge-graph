Albritton began her career in 1968 by casting penises of rock musicians. She later expanded her subjects to include filmmakers and other types of artists, eventually amassing a collection of 50 plaster phalluses. In 2000, she added casting female artists' breasts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Plaster_Caster> .

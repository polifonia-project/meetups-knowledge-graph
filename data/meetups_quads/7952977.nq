<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ralph_Capone> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ralph James Capone (/kəˈpoʊn/; born Raffaele James Capone, Italian: [raffaˈɛːle kaˈpoːne]; January 12, 1894 – November 22, 1974) was an Italian-American Chicago mobster and an older brother of Al Capone and Frank Capone. He got the nickname \"Bottles\" not from involvement in the Capone bootlegging empire, but from his running the legitimate non-alcoholic beverage and bottling operations in Chicago. Further family lore suggests that the nickname was specifically tied to his lobbying the Illinois Legislature to put into law that milk bottling companies had to stamp the date that the milk was bottled on the bottle. He was most famous for being named by the Chicago Crime Commission \"Public Enemy Number Three\" when his brother Al was \"Public Enemy Number One\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ralph_Capone> .

He attended Box Hill School in Surrey, where he met Chris Townson. John's Children also featured Marc Bolan and Chris Townson. A song sung by Ellison, \"It's Been A Long Time\", appears on the soundtrack to the film, Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush. \"It's Been A Long Time\" also featured on the compilation album, Backtrack 1, a Track Records release featuring The Who and Jimi Hendrix amongst others. Jet released an album on CBS Records in 1975, toured as support to Hunter-Ronson and then became Radio Stars, who had one UK Top 40 hit, \"Nervous Wreck\" in early 1978. It peaked at No. 39. The B-side to the single was a cover of Marc Bolan's \"Horrible Breath\", a John's Children staple." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andy_Ellison> .

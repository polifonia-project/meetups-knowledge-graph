He made numerous recordings that are still available on CD reissues. Nash's voice was of the light tenor class known as \"tenore di grazia\". The critic J. B. Steane referred to him as \"the English lyric tenor par excellence, without equal then or now.\" He appeared in tenor roles in operas by Mozart, Verdi, Wagner and Puccini among others, at the Royal Opera House, and the Glyndebourne Festival. His operatic career lasted from 1924 to 1958. As a concert singer, Nash was known for his performances in oratorio, and in particular in the title role of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, making the first gramophone recording of the work, in 1945." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heddle_Nash> .

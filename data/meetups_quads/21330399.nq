<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fandango_(wrestler)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Curtis Jonathan Hussey (born July 22, 1983) is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) under the ring name Dirty Dango. He is best known for his time in WWE, where he performed under the ring name Fandango. Hussey began his professional wrestling career in 1999. He competed in several independent promotions in New England, winning the PLW New England Championship, the PWF Northeast Tag Team Championship with Kenn Phoenix on more than one occasion, the PWF Northeast Heavyweight Championship, NCW New England Championship, the Tag Team Championship with Damian Houston, and the SCCW Lightweight Championship. In 2006, Hussey signed a development contract with World Wrestling Entertainment and was assigned to their developmental territory, Deep South Wrestling (DSW). He was then moved to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in June 2008, where he won the Florida Tag Team Championship on more than one occasion with Tyler Reks and Derrick Bateman. In December 2010, he competed in the fourth season of NXT as Johnny Curtis, and he eventually won the competition in March 2011. In 2013, Hussey re-debuted as Fandango. Subsequently, WWE audience members started singing and dancing to his entrance music, which rose substantially on the iTunes charts and generated coverage in mainstream media. He later formed a tag team with Tyler Breeze called Breezango, with the duo winning the NXT Tag Team Championship in August 2020." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fandango_(wrestler)> .

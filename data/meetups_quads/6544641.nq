<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Hanley_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen Hanley (born 29 May 1959) is an Irish-born English musician who grew up in and lives in Manchester, He is best known as the bass guitarist in the Fall from 1979 to 1998. His distinctive and muscular basslines were a signature part of their sound, often carrying the songs' instrumental melodies. He is currently a member of Brix & the Extricated with guitarist and vocalist Brix Smith Start. Hanley was a foundational Fall member, second only to Mark E. Smith in longevity in the band. With Peter Hook, Andy Rourke and Gary Mounfield, he is widely considered one of the pre-eminent Manchester bassists of his generation. He has always been very private and rarely interviewed; for this reason his 2014 autobiography The Big Midweek: Life Inside The Fall was highly anticipated. On publication it was met with widespread acclaim for its frank honesty and dry, no nonsense humour." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Steve_Hanley_(musician)> .

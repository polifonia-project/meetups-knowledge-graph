<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Herodotus (/həˈrɒdətəs/ hə-ROD-ə-təs; Ancient Greek: Ἡρόδοτος, romanized: Hēródotos; c. 484 – c. 425 BC) was an ancient Greek historian and geographer from the Greek city of Halicarnassus, part of the Persian Empire (now Bodrum, Turkey) and a later citizen of Thurii in modern Calabria (Italy). He is known for having written the Histories – a detailed account of the Greco-Persian Wars. Herodotus was the first writer to perform systematic investigation of historical events. He is referred to as \"The Father of History\", a title conferred on him by the ancient Roman orator Cicero. The Histories primarily cover the lives of prominent kings and famous battles such as Marathon, Thermopylae, Artemisium, Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale. His work deviates from the main topics to provide a cultural, ethnographical, geographical, and historiographical background that forms an essential part of the narrative and provides readers with a wellspring of additional information. Herodotus has been criticized for his inclusion of \"legends and fanciful accounts\" in his work. The fellow historian Thucydides accused him of making up stories for entertainment. However, Herodotus explained that he reported what he \"saw and [what was] told to him\". A sizable portion of the Histories has since been confirmed by modern historians and archaeologists." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus> .

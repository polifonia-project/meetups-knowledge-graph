<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Walser_(musicologist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Walser is an American musicologist associated with the \"new musicology\". He is author of the book Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music, concerning heavy metal music. Walser currently is a member of the faculty at Case Western Reserve University. Walser has also served as an expert witness for over 250 music copyright infringement cases, generally reserved to the Ninth Circuit. His big success came from a broad statement of support from Circuit Judge William C. Canby, Jr., who fully supported Dr. Walser's methodology, despite the less-than-appropriate credibility that Dr. Walser received via District Judge Christina A. Snyder {see Swirsky v. Carey, 226 F. Supp. 2d 1224 (C.D. Cal. 2002). Walser is married to musicologist Susan McClary." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Walser_(musicologist)> .

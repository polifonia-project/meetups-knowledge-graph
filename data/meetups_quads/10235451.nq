<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Olson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Bruce Olson (born November 10, 1941) is a Scandinavian American Christian missionary best known for his work in bringing Christianity to the Motilone Indians of Colombia and Venezuela. Olson's 1973 autobiographical book Bruchko has sold more than 300,000 copies worldwide and is translated into several languages. One journalist has asserted that the book is a touchstone of missionary literature. Olson was granted Colombian citizenship in 1988 and, as of a year later, was still living in a Motilone village. Swedish anthropologists accused Olson of destroying an aboriginal tribe and called for him and other Christian missionaries and linguists to be expelled. This scrutiny compelled Swedish journalist Andres Küng to travel all the way to the Colombian jungle to investigate and interview Olson personally. Küng's findings were quickly published in support of Olson. John Allen Chau, who identified Olson as a major source of inspiration, was killed by the isolated Sentinelese tribe while attempting to convert them to Christianity in 2018." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bruce_Olson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayut_Chan-o-cha> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Prayut Chan-o-cha (sometimes spelled Prayuth Chan-ocha; Thai: ประยุทธ์ จันทร์โอชา, pronounced [prā.jút tɕān.ʔōː.tɕʰāː]; born 21 March 1954) is a Thai politician and retired army officer who has served as the Prime Minister of Thailand since he seized power in a military coup in 2014. He is concurrently the Minister of Defence, a position he has held in his own government since 2019. Prayut served as Commander in Chief of Royal Thai Army from 2010 to 2014 and led the 2014 Thai coup d'état which installed the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), the military junta which governed Thailand between 22 May 2014 and 10 July 2019. After his appointment as army chief in 2010, Prayut was characterised as a royalist and an opponent of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Considered a hardliner within the military, he was one of the leading proponents of military crackdowns on the Red Shirt demonstrations of April 2009 and April–May 2010. He later sought to moderate his profile, talking to relatives of protesters who were killed in the bloody conflict, and co-operating with the government of Yingluck Shinawatra who won parliamentary elections in July 2011. During the political crisis that began in November 2013 and involved protests against the caretaker government of Yingluck, Prayut claimed that the army was neutral and would not launch a coup. However, in May 2014, Prayut launched a military coup against the government and assumed control of the country as dictator and leader of the National Council for Peace and Order, a military junta. He later issued an interim constitution granting himself sweeping powers and giving himself amnesty for staging the coup. In August 2014, an unelected military-dominated national legislature appointed him as Prime Minister. After seizing power, Prayut's government oversaw a significant crackdown on dissent. He formulated “twelve values” based on traditional Thai values and suggested that these be included in school lessons. Measures were implemented to limit public discussions about democracy and criticism of the government, including increases in Internet and media censorship. Prayut was re-elected as Prime Minister of Thailand following the disputed 2019 Thai general election. In August 2022, the Constitutional Court of Thailand suspended Prayut from his duties pending the court case on whether he had exceeded the term limit for the office of Prime Minister. On 30 September 2022, the Constititutional Court of Thailand ruled that he had not exceeded his constitutional term limit for the office of Prime Minister. As such; his premiership resumed and his principal deputy, First Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan ceased to act as the Acting Prime Minister of Thailand." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayut_Chan-o-cha> .

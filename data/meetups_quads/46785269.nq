From 1969 to 1995 he worked in Australia in a variety of bands before returning to Auckland. He contributed to Rocco (1976), as a member of Johnny Rocco Band; Voodoo Soul – Live at The Basement (October 1987), by Leo de Castro and Friends; a live album, Long White Clouds (2007), which had been recorded in January 1988 using two separate backing bands, The Dancehall Racketeers and Roger Janes Band. De Castro's vocals feature on the singles, \"Wichita Lineman\" (January 1971) by King Harvest, \"Heading in the Right Direction\" (August 1975) by Johnny Rocco Band, \"Suspicious Minds\" (June 1979) by Leo de Castro and Babylon. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described him as a \"permanent fixture of the pub/concert/festival circuit and was praised for his vocal abilities\" as \"one of the best soul singers working in Australia\" during the 1970s. From 1995 de Castro was performing in and around Hobart. His farewell gig in 2008 was recorded and filmed live at the Republic Bar. Leo and the Warriors featured some of Tassie finest musicians including fellow Kiwi the late great guitarist/vocalist Joe Pirere. Later in 2008 moved back to New Zealand to retire." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_de_Castro> .

He is known for directing Jamie xx's video \"Gosh\", Kanye West's video \"No Church in the Wild\" and M.I.A.'s video \"Bad Girls\". He also directed Justice's \"Stress\" and M.I.A.'s \"Born Free\", both controversial for their depiction of graphic violence. Gavras' films and music videos often portray a gritty setting juxtaposed with high energy content. His second film, The World Is Yours (Le Monde est à toi) was screened at the Directors' Fortnight during the 2018 Cannes Film Festival." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romain_Gavras> .

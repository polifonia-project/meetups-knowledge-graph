Together with his wife, Linda Murray, he wrote primers on Italian Renaissance art which have been used by generations of students. In 1959 they published the highly successful Penguin Dictionary of Art and Artists, which was frequently updated and reissued. In 1963, they published two substantial introductory texts The Art of the Renaissance, and a book that became a classic primer The Architecture of the Renaissance. Linda also wrote several books on her own, and completed their collaboration The Oxford Companion To Christian Art And Architecture (1996) after Peter died." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Murray_(art_historian)> .

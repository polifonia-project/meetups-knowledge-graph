Born in Scotland. He gained the name \"wonder boy\" after a great trial game for Morton against Queens Park (B Division 1955/56). He continued with his juvenile team Glentyan Thistle, playing in the Lord Weir Cup Final at Cathkin Park in June 1956. He was signed by junior team Glencairn Thistle to serve an apprenticeship before moving to Rangers. Wright was caretaker manager and then manager of Bolton Wanderers in the 1984–85 season. His first game as full-time manager was a 2–0 win against Plymouth Argyle. However, he was quickly replaced by ex-Liverpool and England defender Phil Neal." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlie_Wright> .

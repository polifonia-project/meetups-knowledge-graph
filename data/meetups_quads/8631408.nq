<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levi_Weaver> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Levi Weaver is an American independent musician, singer, songwriter, and performer. He was born in Colorado, raised in Fort Worth, Texas, and now resides in Dallas. Though Levi is an independent musician, he is perhaps best known for his collaborations with artists such as Jenny & Tyler, Imogen Heap and Kid Beyond. Levi's music style can be described as alternative rock or acoustic, though it varies from track to track and album to album. On tour, Levi collaborates with guest artists at times, but typically performs his own works solo. In order to replicate a complex, multi-layered sound from studio sessions, he makes extensive use of a loop pedal during some of his live performances." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levi_Weaver> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Ayldon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Ayldon (11 December 1943 â€“ 16 February 2013) was an English opera singer and comic actor, best known for his performances in bass-baritone roles of the Savoy Operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Though born in England, Ayldon spent several years of his youth in the US, where he became interested in acting and received some professional engagements. He performed in Gilbert and Sullivan productions later in London but did not begin his professional performing career in earnest until 1967, when he joined the D'Oyly Carte as a chorister and small role player. In 1969, he took over the principal bass-baritone roles in the company's entire repertoire, and he continued to play them full-time until the company closed in 1982. After this, he sang roles with opera companies throughout Britain and with Canadian Opera; he appeared frequently in concerts, music hall, cabaret, and pantomime. In London's West End, he understudied and played the role of Firmin in The Phantom of the Opera and played the Pope in Which Witch. Ayldon was a guest artist with the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on its tour to California and toured with such Gilbert and Sullivan concert groups as \"The Magic of D'Oyly Carte\" and \"The Best of Gilbert & Sullivan\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Ayldon> .

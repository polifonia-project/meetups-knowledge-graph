<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilaire_Belloc> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joseph Hilaire Pierre René Belloc (/hɪˈlɛər ˈbɛlək/, French: [ilɛːʁ bɛlɔk]; 27 July 1870 – 16 July 1953) was a Franco-English writer and historian of the early twentieth century. Belloc was also an orator, poet, sailor, satirist, writer of letters, soldier, and political activist. His Catholic faith had a strong effect on his works. Belloc became a naturalised British subject in 1902 while retaining his French citizenship. While attending Oxford, he served as President of the Oxford Union. From 1906 to 1910, he served as one of the few openly Catholic members of the British Parliament. Belloc was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds. He was also a close friend and collaborator of G. K. Chesterton. George Bernard Shaw, a friend and frequent debate opponent of both Belloc and Chesterton, dubbed the pair the \"Chesterbelloc.\" Belloc's writings encompassed religious poetry and comic verse for children. His widely sold Cautionary Tales for Children included \"Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion\" and \"Matilda, who told lies and was burned to death\". He wrote historical biographies and numerous travel works, including The Path to Rome (1902)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hilaire_Belloc> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Martinez_(actor)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Pineda Martinez (born May 31, 1966) is a Filipino actor who belongs to the first batch of Regal babies whose movie career was launched in the early 1980s. He initially starred in drama films, Manila by Night (1980), Bilibid Boys (1981), Tambay sa Disco (1980) until his studio paired him with Maricel Soriano in Oh My Mama (1981) and the result was a box-office success. Their tandem spawned many hits for Regal Films, mostly comedy movies that defined and cemented their Taray and Kulit loveteam. In 1984, William was given a title role in the 10th Metro Manila Film Festival with the thriller, Alapaap as a drug-crazed writer. He got best actor nominations from award-giving bodies the following year. He is also known for his role as Ton-Ton in Bagets & Bagets 2." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Martinez_(actor)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Sculthorpe> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Joshua Sculthorpe AO OBE (29 April 1929 â€“ 8 August 2014) was an Australian composer. Much of his music resulted from an interest in the music of countries neighboring Australia as well as from the impulse to bring together aspects of native Australian music with that of the heritage of the West. He was known primarily for his orchestral and chamber music, such as Kakadu (1988) and Earth Cry (1986), which evoke the sounds and feeling of the Australian bushland and outback. He also wrote 18 string quartets, using unusual timbral effects, works for piano, and two operas. He stated that he wanted his music to make people feel better and happier for having listened to it. He typically avoided the dense, atonal techniques of many of his contemporary composers. His work was often distinguished by its distinctive use of percussion." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Sculthorpe> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Dalrymple> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anthony Malcolm Daniels (born 11 October 1949), also known by the pen name Theodore Dalrymple (/dælˈrɪmpəl/), is a conservative English cultural critic, prison physician and psychiatrist. He worked in a number of Sub-Saharan African countries as well as in the East End of London. Before his retirement in 2005, he worked in City Hospital, Birmingham and Winson Green Prison in inner-city Birmingham, England. Daniels is a contributing editor to City Journal, published by the Manhattan Institute, where he is the Dietrich Weismann Fellow. In addition to City Journal, his work has appeared in: The British Medical Journal, The Times, New Statesman, The Observer, The Daily Telegraph, The Spectator, The Salisbury Review, National Review, New English Review, The Wall Street Journal and Axess magasin. He is the author of a number of books, including: Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass; Our Culture, What's Left of It and Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality. In his writing, Daniels frequently argues that the socially liberal and progressive views prevalent within Western intellectual circles minimise the responsibility of individuals for their own actions and undermine traditional mores, contributing to the formation within prosperous countries of an underclass afflicted by endemic violence, criminality, sexually transmitted diseases, welfare dependency, and drug abuse. Much of Dalrymple's writing is based on his experience of working with criminals and the mentally ill. In 2011, Dalrymple was awarded the Prize for Liberty by the Flemish classical-liberal think-tank Libera!." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodore_Dalrymple> .

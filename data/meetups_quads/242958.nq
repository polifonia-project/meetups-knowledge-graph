His scores, now numbering over one hundred, have won him the Pulitzer Prize, five Grammy Awards, Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition, and an Oscar. He is a distinguished professor of music at Lehman College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and on the composition faculty at the Juilliard School. Corigliano is best known for his Symphony No. 1, a response to the AIDS epidemic, and his film score for Fran√ßois Girard's The Red Violin (1997), which he subsequently adapted as the 2003 Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (\"The Red Violin\") for Joshua Bell." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Corigliano> .

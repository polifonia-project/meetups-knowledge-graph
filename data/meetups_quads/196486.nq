<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_J._Donovan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Joseph \"Wild Bill\" Donovan (January 1, 1883 â€“ February 8, 1959) was an American soldier, lawyer, intelligence officer and diplomat, best known for serving as the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research and the Central Intelligence Agency, during World War II. He is regarded as the founding father of the CIA, and a statue of him stands in the lobby of the CIA headquarters building in Langley, Virginia. A decorated veteran of World War I, Donovan is the only person to have received all four of the United States' highest awards: the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the National Security Medal. He is also a recipient of the Silver Star and Purple Heart, as well as decorations from a number of other nations for his service during both World Wars." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_J._Donovan> .

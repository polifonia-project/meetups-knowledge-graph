<http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Nott> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "David Malcolm Nott OBE OStJ FRCS (born 1956) is a Welsh consultant surgeon who works mainly in London hospitals as a general and vascular surgeon, but also volunteers to work in disaster and war zones. Having recognised that training others could greatly increase his capacity to help, Nott established the David Nott Foundation, along with his wife Elly, to organise training in emergency surgery for others working in war and disaster zones. He has been honoured for this dangerous work and is now often styled the \"Indiana Jones of surgery\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Nott> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glen_Matlock> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Glen Matlock (born 27 August 1956) is an English musician, best known for being the bass guitarist in the original line-up of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols. He is credited as a songwriter on 10 of the 12 songs on the Sex Pistols' only album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, although he had left the band early in the recording process, credited as bassist and backing vocalist on only two songs on the album, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" and \"God Save The Queen\". Since leaving the Sex Pistols in 1977, he has performed with several other bands, as well as presented his own work. After the death of his replacement in the Sex Pistols, Sid Vicious, Matlock has resumed bass guitar duties for subsequent Sex Pistols reunions, including the 1996 Filthy Lucre Tour, the 2002 concert to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, their 2003 North American Piss Off Tour, and their 2007â€“08 UK and Europe Combine Harvester Tour." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glen_Matlock> .

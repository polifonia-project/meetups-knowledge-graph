<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edyta_Górniak> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Edyta Anna Górniak (Polish pronunciation: [ɛˈdɨta ˈɡurɲak]; born 14 November 1972) is a Polish pop singer with a career spanning 3 decades. She is noted for possessing a wide vocal range of approximately four octaves. Górniak started as a musical theatre actress in 1990. She performed in the most popular musical in Polish history, the Tony Award-nominated Metro. Some of its shows took place on Broadway. Górniak was Poland's first representative in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1994 with the song \"To nie ja\". She placed second which still remains the country's best result at the competition. This started her decades-long career as a pop singer in her native country and internationally. She is the recipient of the Bronze Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis for her contributions to the arts. Her career suffered considerably when she began spreading conspiracy theories about COVID-19, among others." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edyta_Górniak> .

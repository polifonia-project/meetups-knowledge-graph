<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Royston> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert N. Royston (1918 â€“ September 19, 2008) was one of America's most distinguished landscape architects, based in the San Francisco Bay Area of California in the United States. His design work and university teaching in the years following World War II helped define and establish the California modernism style in the post-war period. During his sixty years of professional practice Royston completed an array of award-winning projects that ranged from residential gardens to regional land use plans. He is perhaps best known for his important innovations in park design. A recent book, Modern Public Gardens: Robert Royston and the Suburban Park, details this area of his professional creativity and philosophy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Royston> .

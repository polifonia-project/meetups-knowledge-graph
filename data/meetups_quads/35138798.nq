<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basuki_Tjahaja_Purnama> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Chinese: 鐘萬學; pinyin: Zhōng Wànxué, Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: Chûng Van-ho̍k; born 29 June 1966) is an Indonesian businessman, politician, and former governor of Jakarta. He is also known by his Hakka Chinese nickname Ahok (Chinese: 阿學). He was the second minority governor of Jakarta with Chinese ancestry and also of the Evangelical faith, following Henk Ngantung, who was governor of Catholic faith from 1964–65. Ahok was a legislator in the Indonesian People's Representative Council (DPR) and Regent of East Belitung. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the 2009–2014 term but resigned in 2012 to run for the deputy governorship of Jakarta, to which he was elected. In November 2014, he became governor of Jakarta, as his predecessor Joko Widodo had become president. Ahead of the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election, Ahok's political rivals aligned themselves with Islamic extremists to exploit religious and racial intolerance, resulting in Ahok being accused of blasphemy in October 2016. He then lost the election to former Education Minister Anies Baswedan and was imprisoned for blasphemy." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basuki_Tjahaja_Purnama> .

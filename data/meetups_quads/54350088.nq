<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lizzy's_Husband> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Renato Freitas (born 22 March 1991), stage name Lizzy's Husband, is a Portuguese electronic music artist who combines various genres of electronica, especially industrial electronica and dance pop music. Being an autodidact, Renato makes use of sound elements and several instruments in his production. He is keen on the guitar, the keyboard, bass guitar and recording and production tasks. Up until now, he has released four studio albums, one compilation album and several singles and music videos. In December 2015, Bandcom created an online poll, \"Best Portuguese Album of The Year\", in which his debut studio album was included and nominated for. He is currently working on new music, which has been referred as a departure from his electronic-industrial roots, exploring new and different music genres and styles." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lizzy's_Husband> .

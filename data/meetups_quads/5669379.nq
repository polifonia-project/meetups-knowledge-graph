<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_McCormick_(pitcher)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James McCormick (3 November 1856 â€“ 10 March 1918) was a Scottish right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. A native of Glasgow (he was actually born outside the Glasgow boundary, in Thornliebank, Renfrewshire), he was the first ballplayer born in Scotland to appear in a major league game. McCormick was great friends with Mike \"King\" Kelly and was also very well liked by Cap Anson, two of the great personalities of early baseball. Anson was McCormick's captain-manager in 1885 and 1886, when Chicago won its last 19th-century pennants." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_McCormick_(pitcher)> .

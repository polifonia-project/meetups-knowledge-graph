<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carl_Hiaasen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Carl Hiaasen (/ˈhaɪ.əsɛn/; born March 12, 1953) is an American journalist and novelist. He began his career as a newspaper reporter and by the late 1970s had begun writing novels in his spare time, both for adults and for young-adult readers. Two of his novels have been made into feature films. Hiaasen's adult novels are humorous crime thrillers set in Florida. They feature casts of eccentric, sometimes grotesque characters and satirize aspects of American popular culture. Many of the novels include themes related to environmentalism and political corruption in his native state." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carl_Hiaasen> .

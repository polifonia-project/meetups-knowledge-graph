<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Knight> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frank Hyneman Knight (November 7, 1885 â€“ April 15, 1972) was an American economist who spent most of his career at the University of Chicago, where he became one of the founders of the Chicago School. Nobel laureates Milton Friedman, George Stigler and James M. Buchanan were all students of Knight at Chicago. Ronald Coase said that Knight, without teaching him, was a major influence on his thinking. F.A. Hayek considered Knight to be one of the major figures in preserving and promoting classical liberal thought in the twentieth century. Paul Samuelson named Knight (along with Harry Gunnison Brown, Allyn Abbott Young, Henry Ludwell Moore, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Jacob Viner, and Henry Schultz) as one of the several \"American saints in economics\" born after 1860." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Knight> .

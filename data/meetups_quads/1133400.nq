<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jaya_Bachchan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jaya Bachchan (n√©e Bhaduri; born 9 April 1948) is an Indian actress and politician. She is a member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha from the Samajwadi Party, serving four terms since 2004. Known primarily for her work in Hindi and Bengali cinema, she is noted for reinforcing a natural style of acting in both mainstream and \"middle-of-the-road\" cinema. She has received several accolades, including nine Filmfare Awards and the Padma Shri, the fourth-highest civilian honour awarded by the Government of India. Making her film debut as a teenager in Satyajit Ray's Mahanagar (1963), Bachchan's first screen role as an adult was in Guddi (1971), directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, with whom she collaborated in several films thereafter. She was noted for her refreshing performances in films like Uphaar (1971), Koshish (1972) and Kora Kagaz (1974), among others. She starred alongside her husband Amitabh Bachchan in several films, including Zanjeer (1973), Abhimaan (1973), Chupke Chupke (1975) and Mili (1975). The cult film Sholay (1975) saw her playing the much-lauded role of a young widow. Following her marriage to actor Amitabh Bachchan and the birth of their children, she restricted her work in films, notably appearing in Nauker (1979) and Silsila (1981). After a 17-year sabbatical, she returned to acting with Govind Nihalani's Hazaar Chaurasi Ki Maa (1998). She has since appeared in the critically acclaimed films Fiza (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jaya_Bachchan> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Fay_(banker)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Humphrey Michael Gerard Fay (born 10 April 1949) is a New Zealand merchant banker and partner in the merchant bank Fay Richwhite. He is one of the ten richest men in New Zealand. His personal wealth was largely acquired during the late 1980s and early 1990s, which included the period in which he had a significant role in the structural adjustment of the New Zealand economy undertaken by New Zealand's Fourth Labour Government. He is thought to be worth in excess of NZD 920 million, making him the 10th richest New Zealand citizen in 2017." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Fay_(banker)> .

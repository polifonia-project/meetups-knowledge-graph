From 1933 to 1936 he toured China with Buck Clayton, then freelanced in California (with Maxine Sullivan, among others) until 1941. After military service from 1943–45, he accompanied Ivie Anderson, and led his own trio which accompanied Billie Holiday at one point. He also worked in the Spirits of Rhythm. As a composer, he penned the tunes \"Softly\" (covered by Holliday) and \"Bye and Bye\", a hit for The Turbans. He plays on the soundtrack to the 1951 film The Strip; he also makes an appearance in the film.

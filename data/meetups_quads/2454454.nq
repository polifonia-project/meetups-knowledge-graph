<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Toback> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Toback (/ˈtoʊbæk/; born November 23, 1944) is an American film director and screenwriter. His screenplay for Bugsy won the 1991 Los Angeles Film Critics Association award for best screenplay of the year and was nominated for both the Academy Award for best original screenplay and for the Golden Globe best screenplay award. Toback's documentary Tyson, which he directed and co-produced, was featured at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, winning a prize in the festival's Un Certain Regard section. That film was nominated for best documentary awards in several United States competitions. In 2009, the San Francisco International Film Festival selected Toback for its annual Kanbar Award for excellence in screenwriting. Filmmaker Nicholas Jarecki examined Toback in a 2005 documentary The Outsider: A Film about James Toback. Interspliced with a narrative tracking Toback's 2004 whirlwind creation of When Will I Be Loved, Jarecki puts a \"Who is James Toback?\" question to multiple luminaries who know Toback through their collaborations in his work and in his personal life. For Toback, work and personal life sometimes blend. His first major film success was authoring The Gambler in 1974. It won a Golden Globe Best Actor nomination for James Caan as a compulsive gambler heavily in debt to the mob. In The Outsider, when asked how he first met Toback, Jeff Berg, Toback's agent at that time, answered, \"He walked into my office. We had never met each other and he asked for a loan of $275,000 because he had some pressing gambling obligations that had to be satisfied.\" In late 2017, the \"Weinstein effect\" that followed media reports of film producer Harvey Weinstein's abusive conduct with women gave rise to a flood of #MeToo revelations and allegations, and many of these named Toback." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Toback> .

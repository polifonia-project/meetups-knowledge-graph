Born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, she began going to recording studios at the age of 4 with her father and recorded a pop studio album five years later. With the help of a famous Malaysian record producer, in 2005 Shila released her second pop studio album, Sha-Hila. Her single \"Patah Seribu\" (2011) received Pop Song of the Year and Song of the Year at the 19th Malaysian Music Awards. She continued her singing career by breaking out to Shanghai, China and eventually won the Asian Wave. As a result, Shila received the Kembara Award (International Music Breakthrough Award) from Malaysian Music Awards making Shila the youngest Kembara Award honoree. Afterwards, Shila continued her singing career in mandopop industry by breaking out to Hong Kong in 2015 by releasing some new singles, doing an international press conference and establishing her second record label and global management company, Shilala (HK) Limited. Her success on international stages has gained her honorific titles such as Asia's Sweetheart, Princess of Music, and National Treasure of Malaysia. Shila was the first runner-up of Bintang Kecil RTM in 2000, first runner-up of One in a Million (season 2), winner of Asia New Singer Competition in 2008, second runner-up of I Am a Singer (season 2) in 2014, and first runner-up of Anugerah Juara Lagu in 2011 and 2015. Before the Asian Wave, she performed a duet with Miley Cyrus called \"The Best of Both Worlds\" to promote Hannah Montana in Malaysia. In 2013, Shila was the first Malay and Malaysian artist to be nominated at the World Music Awards after winning Asian Wave as well being the first and only Malay artist to be invited to the Global Chinese Music Awards (GCMA). She is the first and only Malay artist to have success in Chinese-speaking countries and Chinese record charts with her Sina Weibo account having more than 2.3 million followers. She was listed in the Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia (2018), recognizing young leaders, entrepreneurs and game changers from across Asia under Entertainment and Sports category. Shila used the stage name \"NurShahila\" name when she was a child. In 2004, she changed her name to Sha-Hila as her record company, EMI, wanted her name to be shorter. When she joined the One in a Million singing contest she needed to make her name even shorter. The organiser of One in a Million (Season 2) truncated her name to just Shila. After coming in as the first runner-up of One in A Million (season 2), she was called \"Shila OIAM\". She didn't like the name, so she added \"Amzah\" to her stage name, as her father's name is Amir Amzah. In Chinese-speaking countries, Shila's name is 茜拉 (Xila)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shila_Amzah> .

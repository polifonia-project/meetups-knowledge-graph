<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mani_Ratnam> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gopala Ratnam Subramaniam (born 2 June 1956), known professionally as Mani Ratnam, is an Indian film director, screenwriter, and producer who predominantly works in Tamil cinema and few Hindi films. Ratnam has won six National Film Awards, four Filmfare Awards, six Filmfare Awards South, and numerous awards at various film festivals across the world. In 2002, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, acknowledging his contributions to film. Despite being born into a film family, Mani Ratnam did not develop any interest in films when he was young. Upon completion of his post graduation in management, he started his career as a consultant. He entered the film industry through the 1983 Kannada film, Pallavi Anu Pallavi. The failure of his subsequent films would mean that he was left with fewer offers. However, his fifth directorial outing, Mouna Ragam (1986), established him as a leading filmmaker in Tamil cinema. He was the director of the critically acclaimed, national award-winning movies Nayakan (1987) and Anjali (1990), both of which qualified as India's official entry for The Academy Awards. Mani Ratnam is well known for his terrorism trilogy of Roja (1992), Bombay (1995), and Dil Se.. (1998), and his romantic trilogy of Mouna Ragam (1986), Alaipayuthey (2000), and O Kadhal Kanmani (2015). He is married to actress Suhasini Maniratnam, with whom he has a son." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mani_Ratnam> .

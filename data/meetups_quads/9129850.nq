He is the son of Dorothy and Pastor Brady Blade Sr. (Pastor of the Zion Baptist Church in Shreveport, Louisiana). His brother is jazz drummer Brian Blade. Having learned to play drums in both high school and as part of his father's church, Brady initially sought out a career in business, focusing on the music industry. This led to A&R roles at several major record labels, before ultimately becoming manager to the Brand New Heavies. He has played as part of Emmylou Harris's band, Spyboy, Steve Earle and the Dukes, Dave Matthews & Friends, and with Buddy & Julie Miller." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brady_Blade> .

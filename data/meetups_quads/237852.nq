A literature professor at the University of Birmingham until 1987, some of his novels satirise academic life, notably the \"Campus Trilogy\" â€“ Changing Places: A Tale of Two Campuses (1975), Small World: An Academic Romance (1984) and Nice Work (1988). The second two were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Another theme is Roman Catholicism, beginning from his first published novel The Picturegoers (1960). Lodge has also written television screenplays and three stage plays. After retiring, he continued to publish literary criticism. His edition of Twentieth Century Literary Criticism (1972) includes essays on 20th-century writers such as T. S. Eliot." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Lodge_(author)> .

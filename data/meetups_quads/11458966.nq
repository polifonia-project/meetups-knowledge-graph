<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brent_Crosswell> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Brent Tasman Crosswell (born 8 August 1950) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Carlton Football Club, North Melbourne Football Club and Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL). An articulate and outspoken individual, 'Tiger' Crosswell was renowned as one of the finest 'big game' players of his era and is one of a small group of VFL/AFL footballers to have won premierships with two clubs. He is recognized for his on-field achievements with Icon status in the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame, as well as being named in the Tasmanian and North Melbourne Teams of the Century. Crosswell was also known for his tempestuous professional relationship with coach Ron Barassi, under whom he played at all three clubs for all but four of his fifteen seasons in the VFL." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brent_Crosswell> .

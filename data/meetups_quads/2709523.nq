<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Doyle> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Doyle (20 March 1939 – 22 June 2015) was an Irish hurler who played as a right wing-forward for the Tipperary senior team. Born in Thurles, County Tipperary, Doyle first played competitive hurling whilst at school in Thurles CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of fourteen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor team. He made his senior debut in the 1957–58 National League. Doyle went on to play a key part for Tipperary during a hugely successful era for the team, and won six All-Ireland medals, nine Munster medals and seven National Hurling League medals. An All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions, Doyle also captained the team to All-Ireland victory in 1962 and 1965. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team for twelve years, Doyle won eight Railway Cup medals. At club level he won ten championship medals with Thurles Sarsfield's. At the time of his retirement Doyle's career tally of 18 goals and 176 points ranked him as Tipperary's all-time top scorer. It was a record which stood until 24 June 2007 when it was surpassed by Eoin Kelly. His father, Gerry, his uncle, Tommy, and his brother, Paddy Doyle, also enjoyed All-Ireland success with Tipperary. Throughout his career Doyle made 39 championship appearances. His retirement came following Tipperary's defeat by Limerick in the 1973 championship. In retirement from playing Doyle became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he guided to championship success before later taking charge of the Laois senior team. Doyle is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game. During his playing days he won three Cú Chulainn awards, as well as being named Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1965. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at right corner-forward on the Hurling Team of the Century in 1984 and at left corner-forward on the Hurling Team of the Millennium in 2000." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmy_Doyle> .

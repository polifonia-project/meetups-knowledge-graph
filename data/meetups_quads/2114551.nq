<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Henry_(wide_receiver)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Chris Henry (May 17, 1983 – December 17, 2009) was an American football wide receiver who played five seasons in the National Football League for the Cincinnati Bengals. He played college football at West Virginia and was drafted by the Bengals in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Henry died on December 17, 2009, when he was dragged from a moving truck that his fiancée was driving after a verbal altercation. An autopsy revealed that Henry had developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) during his playing career due to repetitive hits to the head. Because CTE can only be diagnosed in an autopsy and Henry was still active in the NFL when he died, Henry represented the first case where an active player had died and could be diagnosed with CTE." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chris_Henry_(wide_receiver)> .

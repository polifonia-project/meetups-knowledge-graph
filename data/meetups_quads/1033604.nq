One of the most popular German players in his days, Briegel's original sport was athletics, being successful in various events such as long jump (personal best: 7 metres 44 cm, aged 16), triple jump and specifically in heptathlon-forerunner pentathlon. Briegel also ran 100 metres in 10.81 seconds, aged 16. At the age of 17, he left athletics behind him, playing club football with hometown side SV Rodenbach near Kaiserslautern. During his playing days, Briegel usually played as a left back and defensive midfielder. He was known primarily for his physical abilities as well as his technical abilities and goal scoring abilities for a defensive player." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hans-Peter_Briegel> .

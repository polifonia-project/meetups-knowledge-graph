<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Holtzman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kenneth Dale Holtzman (born November 3, 1945) is an American former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher from 1965 through 1979, most notably as a member of the Chicago Cubs for whom he pitched two no-hitters and, with the Oakland Athletics dynasty that won three consecutive World Series championships between 1972 to 1974. A two-time All-Star, Holtzman was a 20-game-winner for the Athletics in 1973. He also played for the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees. Holtzman was the first Cubs pitcher in the live-ball era to throw two no-hitters; the next Cubs pitcher to do so was Jake Arrieta some three and a half decades later. In 2007, Holtzman managed the Petach Tikva Pioneers in the Israel Baseball League." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Holtzman> .

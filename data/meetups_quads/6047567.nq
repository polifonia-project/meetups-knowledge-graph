He is based in New York City, after spending seven years in Colombia. Holland records under various pseudonyms, including Quantic, the Quantic Soul Orchestra, The Limp Twins, Flowering Inferno, and Ondatr√≥pica. His music features elements of cumbia, salsa, bossa nova, soul, funk and jazz. Holland plays guitars, bass, double bass, piano, organ, saxophone, accordion and percussion. Much of his sound is original composition, rather than sampling of other artists' material. In addition to his original compositions, he has also produced remixes of over 30 songs. Holland's first label was called Magnetic Fields, on which he released heavy soul and funk. Holland retired Magnetic Fields in 2003. In 2018, Holland founded the record label Selva, based in Brooklyn NY, and he has been releasing music on Selva since the start of 2020." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Will_Holland> .

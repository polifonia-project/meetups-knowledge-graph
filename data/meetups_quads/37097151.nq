<http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Day_(horseman)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Day (1823â€“1908) was a British jockey and trainer. A member of a large and successful racing family, Day had some success as a jockey before setting up as a trainer at Woodyates, Dorset in 1848. In a training career of over thirty years he sent out the winners of three classics and numerous major handicap races before retiring in the 1880s. His best horse was probably the American colt Foxhall. Day was also a gambler who was involved in scandals and clashes with other racing figures." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Day_(horseman)> .

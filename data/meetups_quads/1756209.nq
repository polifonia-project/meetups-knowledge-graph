<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Douglas_(governor)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir James Douglas KCB (August 15, 1803 â€“ August 2, 1877) was a British Columbian fur trader and politician who became the first Governor of the Colony of British Columbia. He is often credited as \"The Father of British Columbia.\" He was instrumental to the resettlement of 35 African-Americans fleeing a life of racial persecution in San Francisco who arrived in the province aboard the steampship Commodore in what later became known as the Pioneer Committee. In 1863, Douglas was knighted by Queen Victoria for his services to the Crown. He started work at 16 for the North West Company and then the Hudson's Bay Company and became a high-ranking officer. From 1851 to 1864, he was Governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island. In 1858, he became the first Governor of the Colony of British Columbia and asserted the authority of the British Empire during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, which had the potential to turn the Mainland into an American state. He remained governor of both colonies until his retirement in 1864." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Douglas_(governor)> .

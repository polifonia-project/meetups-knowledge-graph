<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winston_Wright> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Winston Wright (1943 â€“ 1993) was a Jamaican keyboardist. He was a member of Tommy McCook's Supersonics, and acknowledged as Jamaica's master of the Hammond organ. Winston was born in May Pen, Jamaica on September 5, 1943 and died in Kingston, Jamaica on March 18,1993. He attended Glenmuir High School where he learned the organ on an old Clavonette Organ. While he was in school, he played with a local group called the Mercury Band based at the Capri Theatre in May Pen, much to his father's ire. Tommy McCook saw Winston play at this time and he was invited to join the Supersonics, the Treasure Isle house band. Perhaps Wright's best known work is as the uncredited lead organist on Harry J Allstars' 1969 instrumental hit \"The Liquidator\". Along with Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Gladstone \"Gladdy\" Anderson, Dougie Bryan, Winston Grennan and Paul Douglas, Winston was a member of a group of top session musicians known as the Dynamites, the Crystalites, the Beverley's All-Stars (or other All-Stars depending, on the producer) that played on countless recording sessions from the late '60s and early '70s. Wright produced a solo single: \"Top Secret\", with the B-side \"Crazy Rhythm\" in 1970. Having played for Toots and the Maytals from 1968 along with the Dynamites, Winston accompanied Toots with the Dynamites on their numerous tours throughout the 1970s and '80s. He died of a heart attack in March 18,1993." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winston_Wright> .

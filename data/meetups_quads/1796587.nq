<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Millington> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mary Ruth Maxted (née Quilter; 30 November 1945 – 19 August 1979), known professionally as Mary Millington from 1974 onwards, was an English model and pornographic actress. Her appearance in the short softcore film Sex is My Business led to her meeting with magazine publisher David Sullivan, who promoted her widely as a model, and featured her in the softcore comedy Come Play With Me, which ran for a record-breaking four years at the same cinema. However, in her later years she faced depression and pressure from frequent police raids on her sex shop. After a downward spiral of drug addiction, shoplifting and debt, she died at home of an overdose of medications and vodka. She was 33. Millington has been described as one of the \"two hottest British sex film stars of the seventies\", the other being Fiona Richmond." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Millington> .

He is the youngest son of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno with his third wife, Fatmawati, and the brother to former Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri. Guruh attended elementary and high school in Jakarta. He then studied at the Archaeology Faculty at the University of Amsterdam, graduating in 1976. Rather than immediately following in his father's footsteps into politics, he chose a career in the arts, and to date has produced over 100 choreographic works and written popular Indonesian songs. In 1991, he was awarded the Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Knight of the Order of Arts and Letter) by the French government. He recorded an album called Guruh Gipsy in 1977 with Chrisye. He entered politics in 1992, becoming a member of the Indonesian legislature, the People's Representative Council, representing the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI). When the PDI split following a 1996 party congress in Medan, he joined the breakaway Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle. He was reelected under the banner of the new party in the 1999 Indonesian legislative election and was again re-elected in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. He currently represents the regency of Blitar, East Java. He has continued to produce artistic performances, such as the opening ceremony of the 2000 Indonesian National Games in Surabaya." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guruh_Sukarnoputra> .

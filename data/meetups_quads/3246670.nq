<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Killing_of_Meredith_Hunter> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Meredith Curly Hunter, Jr. (October 24, 1951 â€“ December 6, 1969), was an American man who was killed at the 1969 Altamont Free Concert. During the performance by the Rolling Stones, Hunter approached the stage, and was violently driven off by members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club who had agreed to serve as security guards. He subsequently returned to the stage area, drew a revolver, and was stabbed and beaten to death by Hells Angel Alan Passaro. The incident was caught on camera and became a central scene in the Maysles Brothers documentary Gimme Shelter. Passaro was charged with murder and tried in 1971. Following 17 days of testimony, an eight-man, four-woman jury deliberated for 12 and a half hours before Passaro was acquitted on grounds of self-defense." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Killing_of_Meredith_Hunter> .

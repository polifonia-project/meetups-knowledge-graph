<http://dbpedia.org/resource/L._Lin_Wood> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lucian Lincoln \"Lin\" Wood Jr. (born October 19, 1952) is an American attorney and conspiracy theorist. Following his graduation from law school in 1977, Wood worked as a personal injury lawyer, focusing on medical malpractice litigation. He became known as a \"celebrity lawyer\" specializing in defamation lawsuits. Wood first drew media attention in relation to his representation of Richard Jewell, the security guard falsely accused in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta in 1996. Wood's representation of Jewell helped transform him from a personal injury lawyer to a nationally known defamation lawyer. In addition to representing Jewell, Wood has represented the family of JonBen√©t Ramsey and former U.S. representative Gary Condit in defamation suits. He was also hired by Republican political candidate Herman Cain to respond to allegations of sexual harassment. By 2020, Wood was frequently garnering attention through his promotion of conspiracy theories, both in his capacity as a lawyer and as a political commentator and social media personality. After Joe Biden won the presidential election, Wood promoted falsehoods and conspiracy theories on behalf of President Donald Trump, who he claimed actually won the election with 70% of the vote. Wood claimed that a secret cabal of international communists, Chinese intelligence, and Republican officials had contrived to steal the election from Trump. Sometimes in association with Trump's attorney Sidney Powell, Wood litigated on the president's behalf in many failed lawsuits, which sought to prevent the certification of legally cast ballots in the presidential election. In the latter part of 2020, Wood's social media activities attracted considerable attention. Wood called for the imprisonment of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, based on the conspiracy theory that the two Republican officials worked with the Chinese to help rig the vote for Biden. Wood made allegations against Chief Justice John Roberts reflecting QAnon conspiracy theories. He suggested that Vice President Mike Pence would \"face execution by firing squad\" and called for the arrest of then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both for treason. Delaware Supreme Court Judge Craig A. Karsnitz revoked Wood's permission to appear pro hac vice before the Court, writing that there was \"no doubt\" that Wood's tweets were among the factors that incited the storming of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob in January 2021. In August 2021, U.S. District Judge Linda Parker formally sanctioned Wood, Powell and seven other pro-Trump lawyers for their suit seeking to overturn Trump's election loss. The court determined that the nine attorneys had participated in \"a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,\" namely filing a baseless, frivolous lawsuit in order to undermine public confidence in the democratic process. The court ordered Wood and the other lawyers to pay costs to the State of Michigan and City of Detroit for their expenses in defending against the lawsuit, and referred them to their respective state disciplinary authorities for possible disbarment for conduct violating the rules of ethics for attorneys. Wood is a 9/11 truther, claiming \"no planes\" hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001 and that the planes visible in the footage are \"CGI.\" According to posts made on his social media, he believes the Earth is flat, writing \"Is the Earth flat or is it a spinning ball??? The answer is found in the Holy Bible. Do the research. Connect the dots. Draw your own conclusion.\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/L._Lin_Wood> .

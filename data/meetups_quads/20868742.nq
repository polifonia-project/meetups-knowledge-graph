<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarah_Gavron> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sarah Gavron (born 20 April 1970) is a British film director. She has directed four short films, and three feature films. Her first film was This Little Life (2003), later followed by Brick Lane (2007) and Village at the End of the World (2012). Her film, Suffragette (2015) is based in the London of 1912 and tells the story of the Suffragette movement based on realistic historical events. Her most recent film is Rocks which she directed in a creative collaboration with the team and young cast. Rocks premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and opened in cinemas in 2020. Sarah Gavron is also both a wife and a mother, and \"got into filmmaking to make a difference.\" She has dedicated her career to accurately telling the stories of women. In addition, the scarcity of women filmmakers in the UK is what inspires Gavron with her own filmmaking, and her responsibility as a female director." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarah_Gavron> .

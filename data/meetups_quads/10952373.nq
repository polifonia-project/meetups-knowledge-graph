He studied law in New Haven, Connecticut and in Baltimore, Maryland, was admitted to the bar in 1833, and commenced practice in Annapolis, Maryland. He served in the Maryland House of Delegates from Anne Arundel County in 1839, 1841, and 1842, and also served as a member of the Maryland Senate in 1848.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoshimi_P-We> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Yoshimi (born Yoshimi Yokota (横田佳美) on February 18, 1968) is a Japanese musician best known for her role as the longest consistent drummer in the Japanese rock band Boredoms. Alongside her drum playing skills with Boredoms, she performs the vocals for the all female group OOIOO and also plays trumpet, guitar and keyboards as well. Born in Okayama, Japan, Yoshimi joined her first band, U.F.O. or Die, with EYE in 1986. Since 1997, she has led the all-female band OOIOO and continues to contribute to the current incarnation of Boredoms. Yoshimi has worked on many other projects, most notably a raga band called Saicobab, an ambient project called Yoshimi and Yuka, the tribal-drum-influenced OLAibi, and indie supergroup Free Kitten. She appeared as a session player and vocalist on the Flaming Lips' 2002 album Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Yoshimi participated as drummer one in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance, which occurred on July 7, 2007, at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York. Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips said that their album Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots was inspired by Yoshimi. He called her \"one of those strange genius musicians.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yoshimi_P-We> .

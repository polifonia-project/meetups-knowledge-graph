<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Hudson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Eric Hudson (born October 15, 1986) is an American and Grammy award-winning music producer. His parents are Curtis and Phyllis Bivins-Hudson. Curtis is a songwriter and producer, and most notably the co-writer of Madonna's song \"Holiday\", co-written with singer/songwriter Lisa Stevens. Hudson attended Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey, and graduated in 2004. He is a multi-instrumentalist (including piano, drums, bass, guitar, and organ), and honed much of his early music development playing in church and conducting his own jazz band called the Jazz Funk Project. Hudson has played at Carnegie Hall, and performed at the Apollo Theater in Harlem for the 2002 Democratic National Convention. His early introduction into the industry began by working alongside legendary hip hop producers Buckwild and DJ Kay Gee from Naughty by Nature. Hudson was an instrumentalist on two ground-breaking albums, The Game's The Documentary and 50 Cent's The Massacre, which helped take his career to the next level. Soon after, he produced the song \"Entourage\" by Omarion. Hudson has won three Grammy awards and has been a part of more than 60 million records sold worldwide, playing with artists including Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Chris Brown, Ne-Yo, Leona Lewis, John Legend, Kanye West, Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, and Trey Songz." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Hudson> .

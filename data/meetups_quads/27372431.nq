<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_Clifford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Julian Seymour Clifford (London, 28 September 1877 â€“ Hastings, 27 December 1921) was an English conductor, composer and pianist particularly associated with the orchestras at Harrogate and Hastings, which he carried to a high level of accomplishment, introducing new works by English composers and encouraging soloists of national standing to perform in the provinces. His wife, the Hon. Mrs Julian Clifford, was a soprano singer. After his early death his example was followed by their son, also Julian Clifford (born 1903), who was a composer and a conductor working for Decca Records in early days, and championed works by English composers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_Clifford> .

She gained extensive media coverage when the music video for her 2011 single \"Friday\" went viral on YouTube and other social media sites. \"Friday\" was derided by many music critics and viewers, who dubbed it \"the worst song ever\". Black went on to release other songs including her Dave Days collaboration \"Saturday\". She currently uploads videos on her YouTube channel about various topics. She has released two independent extended plays, RE / BL (2017) and Rebecca Black Was Here (2021)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rebecca_Black> .

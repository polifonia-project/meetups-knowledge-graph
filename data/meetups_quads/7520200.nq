<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Goss_(racing_driver)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Goss OAM (born 2 May 1943, in Glen Iris, Victoria) is an Australian retired motor racing driver who competed in his home country during the 1960s, 1970's and 1980's. He is the only driver to have won Australia's two most prestigious races, the Bathurst 1000 (1974 and 1985), and the Australian Grand Prix (1976). During his career, John Goss gained a reputation for long acceptance speeches, with many joking that his victory speech on the Bathurst podium following his 1974 win took almost as long as the race itself (the race, the first to be run in wet conditions, lasted 7 hours, 51 minutes and 43 seconds). Goss was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2018 for services to motorsport." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Goss_(racing_driver)> .

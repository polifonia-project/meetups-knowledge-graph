<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Larry_Lawrence_(gridiron_football)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Larry Robert Lawrence (born April 11, 1949 in Mount Pleasant, Iowa) is a former professional American football quarterback. Lawrence attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and played football in college for the Miami Hurricanes and Iowa Hawkeyes. Undrafted coming out of college, he started his pro career in the CFL for two seasons, then signed with the Oakland Raiders as a free agent. He played for two years as a backup, starting two games and missing most of the 1975 season with an injury. The Buccaneers traded for him during the 1976 preseason. Coach John McKay praised his accuracy in the preseason, but he was unable to make an impact in limited playing time during the regular season, and was waived when Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback Terry Hanratty became available. Lawrence died on December 4, 2012." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Larry_Lawrence_(gridiron_football)> .

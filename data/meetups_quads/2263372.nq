<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joran_van_der_Sloot> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joran Andreas Petrus van der Sloot (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈjoːrɑɱ vɑn dər ˈsloːt]; born 6 August 1987) is a Dutch convicted murderer who killed Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru, in 2010. He is also the prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in 2005.After Flores' murder on 30 May 2010 — five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance — Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for questioning regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Flores. He later tried to formally retract his confession, claiming that he had been intimidated by the Peruvian police and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the confession was valid, and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years' imprisonment for Flores' murder. While living in Aruba five years earlier, Van der Sloot was (and still is) the prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, an 18-year-old American who disappeared on the island on 30 May 2005. Van der Sloot was indicted by a federal grand jury in the U.S. for wire fraud and extortion related to Holloway's whereabouts. Holloway's disappearance remains unsolved. The Holloway and Flores cases both attracted widespread media attention; Time magazine declared Van der Sloot's arrest the top crime story of 2010. Van der Sloot was the subject of international news coverage from prison, leading to controversies that resulted in the investigation and suspension of several Peruvian officials." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joran_van_der_Sloot> .

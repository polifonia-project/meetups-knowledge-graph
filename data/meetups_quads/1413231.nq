His most successful single was a cover of the Phil Ochs/Bob Gibson song \"That's the Way It's Going to Be\". The song, produced by Curt Boettcher, reached No. 86 on the charts and was a surprise hit in Seattle. A CD by the same name was released in 2002, with many songs and demos Mallory had recorded during the 1960s. Lee Mallory helped start the California Sound of the 1960s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Mallory> .

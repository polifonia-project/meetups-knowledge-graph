He co-wrote an album with Swedish pop star Sara Lumholdt (A-teens) and several English/Spanish songs for actress/singer Alessandra Rosaldo (\"Instructions Not Included\"). “Por Tu Amor” and “Eres” were used in Rosaldo’s international hit telenovela \"Ni contigo ni sin ti\" (115 episodes) and as the theme of her televised wedding to Spanish actor Eugenio Derbez in Mexico City (July 2012). Skinner co-wrote Kimberley Locke's \"Sirens\" with Locke and Producer Russell Ali. He also co-wrote Locke's \"Endless Possibilities,\" which debuted at the 2013 Writers & Illustrators of the Future Awards. Skinner spent 9 weeks on the Billboard charts with Sir Ivan‘s dance hit, “La La Land.” The song also reached #10 on the UK Music Week’s Upfront Club Chart and Top 20 on the DJ Times National Crossover Pool Chart. Skinner debuted \"Living Off the Page\" and \"Off the Ground\" at the Writers & Illustrators of the Future Awards at the historic Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles (April 2014). Drew Seeley performed \"Living Off the Page\" with Cassie Simone. \"Off the Ground\" was performed solo by Seeley. Skinner has a project with Dave Koz and there's speculation that Hollywood Records will release a song he co-wrote with producer Brandon Slavinski for Disney Channel star Ross Lynch (Austin and Ally). Lynch's brothers, Rocky Lynch and Riker Lynch of R5 have also tweeted about working with Skinner and Slavinski. Withjosh.com is an internet series where Skinner interviews various people who've made their mark in pop culture. Some interviews include Kris Jenner, Sherri Shepherd, American Idol Winner Kris Allen, Lt. Dan Choi, CNN's Don Lemon and the final interview with the late Eleanor Mondale.

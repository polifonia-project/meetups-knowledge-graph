She graduated in theoretical physics from the University of Cambridge. In April 2012, her one-act musical Before the Law, co-written with Gwyneth Herbert, was awarded second place in the inaugural Sidney Brown Memorial Award for Most Promising New Work which is run by Mercury Musical Developments (MMD), the organisation which supports new musical theatre writing. Before the Law was adapted from A Hand Witch of the Second Stage by Peter Barnes. It is the companion piece to After Lydia, a one-act musical based on Terence Rattiganâ€™s play of the same name, which was commissioned by Sounds of England and was also a collaboration with Gwyneth Herbert. After Lydia was given a 45-minute reading at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London on Monday 14 March 2011, starring Rebecca Caine, Andrew C. Wadsworth, Simon Green and Daniel Fraser, with Stefan Bednarczyk as musical director. Directed by Maria Friedman, it also had a staged reading at the Watermill Theatre, Bagnor, Berkshire in August 2012." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christine_Denniston> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmer_Fredette> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Taft \"Jimmer\" Fredette (born February 25, 1989) is an American former professional basketball player. He last played for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association. Fredette was the 2011 National Player of the Year in college basketball after ranking as the leading scorer in all of NCAA Division I during his senior season for the BYU Cougars. He was subsequently selected with the 10th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft, but only played limited minutes across four teams over five NBA seasons. He spent the majority of the 2015–16 season in the NBA Development League, during which he won the All-Star Game MVP. In 2016, Fredette joined the CBA's Shanghai Sharks, and during the 2016–17 CBA season, he led the league in scoring, at 37.6 points per game, counting all phases of the season (although Errick McCollum was the league's scoring champion, as only regular season stats count toward that award). He also won the CBA International MVP award that season." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimmer_Fredette> .

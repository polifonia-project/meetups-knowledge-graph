<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hasaan_Ibn_Ali> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hasaan Ibn Ali (born William Henry Langford, Jr.; May 6, 1931 – 1980) was an American jazz pianist and composer. Ibn Ali was strongly influenced by Elmo Hope, and his playing was rapid and intense, retaining a sense of rhythm even when his style became increasingly unconventional. Only one recording of his playing – The Max Roach Trio Featuring the Legendary Hasaan – was released in his lifetime. Ibn Ali built a reputation in Philadelphia, where he influenced musicians including John Coltrane, but he remained little known elsewhere." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hasaan_Ibn_Ali> .

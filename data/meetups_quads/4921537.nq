<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Hill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Walter Hill (born January 10, 1942) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer known for his action films and revival of the Western genre. He has directed such films as The Driver, Southern Comfort, 48 Hrs. and its sequel Another 48 Hrs., Streets of Fire and Red Heat, and wrote the screenplay for the crime drama The Getaway. He has also directed several episodes of television series such as Tales from the Crypt and Deadwood and produced the Alien films. Hill said in an interview that \"every film I've done has been a Western\", and elaborated in another that \"the Western is ultimately a stripped down moral universe that is, whatever the dramatic problems are, beyond the normal avenues of social control and social alleviation of the problem, and I like to do that even within contemporary stories\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Hill> .

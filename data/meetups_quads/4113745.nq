Wilkerson co-wrote the song \"It's Not Over\" which was released as a single and as the opening track on the eponymous album by Daughtry. On December 6, 2007, the song earned him and the other co-writers a nomination for Best Rock Song for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. On May 3, 2007, Wilkerson gave a concert to help the relief efforts of Enterprise High School in Alabama, two months after an EF4 tornado destroyed the school and killed eight students." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Wilkerson> .

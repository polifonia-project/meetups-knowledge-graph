<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Waldo_Frank> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Waldo David Frank (August 25, 1889 â€“ January 9, 1967) was an American novelist, historian, political activist, and literary critic, who wrote extensively for The New Yorker and The New Republic during the 1920s and 1930s. Frank is best known for his studies of Spanish and Latin American literature and culture and his work is regarded as an intellectual bridge between the two continents. A radical political activist during the years of the Great Depression, Frank delivered a keynote speech to the first congress of the League of American Writers and was the first chair of that organization. Frank broke with the Communist Party, USA in 1937 over its treatment of exiled Soviet leader Leon Trotsky, whom Frank met in Mexico in January of that year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Waldo_Frank> .

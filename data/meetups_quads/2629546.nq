He was ABC News chief Middle East correspondent from 1983 to 1993, and has worked as a correspondent for Newsweek and The Observer. He writes regularly for The New York Review of Books and his work has appeared in newspapers and magazines, and on television networks, all over the world. Glass is the author of Tribes With Flags: A Dangerous Passage Through the Chaos of the Middle East (1991) and a collection of essays, Money for Old Rope: Disorderly Compositions (1992). A sequel to Tribes with Flags, called The Tribes Triumphant, was published by HarperCollins in June 2006. His book on the beginning of the American war in Iraq, The Northern Front, was published in October 2006 by Saqi. His next book, Americans in Paris (HarperCollins and Penguin Press), tells the story of the American citizens who chose to remain in Paris when the Germans occupied the city in 1940. He also wrote \"Deserter: The Untold Story of World War II\" (Penguin Press and HarperCollins) His most recent book is They Fought Alone: The True Story of the Starr Brothers, British Secret Agents in Nazi-Occupied France (Penguin Press, 2018). One of Glass's best known stories was his 1985 interview on the tarmac of Beirut Airport of the crew of TWA Flight 847 after the flight was hijacked. He broke the news that the hijackers had removed the hostages and had hidden them in the suburbs of Beirut, which caused the Reagan administration to cancel a rescue attempt that would have failed and led to loss of life at the airport. Glass made headlines in 1987, when he was taken hostage for 62 days in Lebanon by Shi'a militants. He describes the kidnapping and escape in his book, Tribes with Flags." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Glass> .

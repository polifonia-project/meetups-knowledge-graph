<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Morris> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "William Weaks Morris (November 29, 1935 â€“ August 2, 1999) was an American writer and editor born in Jackson, Mississippi, though his family later moved to Yazoo City, Mississippi, which he immortalized in his works of prose. Morris' trademark was his lyrical prose style and reflections on the American South, particularly the Mississippi Delta. In 1967 he became the youngest editor of Harper's Magazine. He wrote several works of fiction and nonfiction, including his seminal book , as well as My Dog Skip." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Willie_Morris> .

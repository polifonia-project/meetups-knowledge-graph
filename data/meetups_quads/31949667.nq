<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotty_Granger> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Scotty Granger (born July 19, 1987) also known as Scotty Grand and Scotty G, is an American Pop, R&B, Contemporary Music Producer/Singer/Songwriter. He plays piano, guitar, flute, sax, and piccolo, among others. Granger has famously been linked to having received his talents and voice, specifically, via his Great Aunt being, “Queen of Gospel Music” Mahalia Jackson. After renaming himself Scotty Grand in 2011, he embarked on a solo singing career. And in November of that same year, signed a publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. He has written a number of dance tunes, mainly destined for European dance circuits, but gained fame with the American music market after taking part in Platinum Hit on Bravo and finishing third overall in the competition - though being a fan favorite. In 2021, Grand, became part of the songwriting team that penned the theme song for ABC’s reboot of The Wonder Years. Titled “All I Know”, it has gone on to win awards such as an HMMA (Hollywood Music in Media Award)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotty_Granger> .

The album featured KRS-One, Big Daddy Kane, Pete Rock, O.C. and many more. Later the same year he produced the entire mixtape \"Soulmatic\", a remixed version of Nas classic album \"Stillmatic\", which was released through hiphopsite.com. In 2004 he continued with another remix mixtape; Soul & Sense containing remixes on early Common material when Common still called himself Common Sense. This was in 2005 released on Nocturne as a CD entitled “Uncommonly Nasty: Remixed By Soul Supreme & Statik Selektah”. In 2006 he made URB Magazine’s list of the next 100 producers His production borrows heavily from, often pitched-up, soul samples; hence the name. He is signed to JuJu Publishing.

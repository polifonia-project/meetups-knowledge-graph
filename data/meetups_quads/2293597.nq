<http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Dyson_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir George Dyson KCVO (28 May 1883 â€“ 28 September 1964) was an English musician and composer. After studying at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London, and army service in the First World War, he was a schoolmaster and college lecturer. In 1938 he became director of the RCM, the first of its alumni to do so. As director he instituted financial and organisational reforms and steered the college through the difficult days of the Second World War. As a composer Dyson wrote in a traditional idiom, reflecting the influence of his teachers at the RCM, Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford. His works were well known during his lifetime but underwent a period of neglect before being revived in the late 20th century." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Dyson_(composer)> .

Lewis, where he served for the balance of his academic life. He was considered one of the most promising black scholars of his generation. Among his students during his tenure at the University of Chicago were anthropologists St. Clair Drake and sociologist Nathan Hare. Davis, who has been honored with a commemorative postage stamp by the United States Postal Service, is best remembered for his pioneering anthropology research on southern race and class during the 1930s, his research on intelligence quotient tests in the 1940s and 1950s, and his support of \"compensatory education,\" an area in which he contributed to the intellectual genesis of the federal Head Start Program." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allison_Davis_(anthropologist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Goodwin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Goodwin (c. 1800 â€“ after 1835) was a convict escapee and explorer in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania). In March 1828, he escaped from the notorious Sarah Island prison with fellow convict Thomas Connolly, and the two were the first white men to pass through the Lake St Clair region. Assuming Goodwin was then taken on to Hobart, he is the first white man to have traversed Tasmania from west to east." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Goodwin> .

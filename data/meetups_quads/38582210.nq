<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Max_Meyer_(footballer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Maximilian Meyer (German pronunciation: [maksiˈmiːli̯aːn ˈmaks ˈmaɪ̯ɐ]; born 18 September 1995) is a German professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Swiss club FC Luzern. Meyer began his career in 2000, playing for local clubs in his hometown of Oberhausen. He then played within MSV Duisburg's youth system for five years, before moving to Schalke 04 in 2009. Following success at U-19 level, Meyer was promoted to the senior side, making his debut in 2013. Initially playing as an attacking midfielder, his position was made more defensive in the 2017–18 season, but a dispute with the Schalke hierarchy the following April saw him fall out of favour and subsequently run down his contract, becoming a free agent that summer. Internationally, he represented Germany at various youth levels, playing for U15, U16, U17, U19 and U21 teams. He made his senior debut in 2014, and later captained the Olympic team at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where they finished as runners-up." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Max_Meyer_(footballer)> .

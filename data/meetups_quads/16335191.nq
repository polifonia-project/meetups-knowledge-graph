<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michu> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Miguel Pérez Cuesta (born 21 March 1986), known as Michu (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈmitʃu]), is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a striker or attacking midfielder. He started playing for Real Oviedo, subsequently representing Celta and Rayo Vallecano, making his La Liga debut with the latter in 2011–12. In 2012 he signed with Swansea City, scoring 22 goals across all competitions in his first season and winning the League Cup. Despite performances that earned him an international debut for Spain in 2013, Michu fell out of favour at Swansea and was released in November 2015." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michu> .

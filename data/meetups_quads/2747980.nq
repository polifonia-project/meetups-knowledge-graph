He batted and threw right-handed. A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Trucks posted a 177–135 win–loss record with 1,534 strikeouts and a 3.39 ERA in 2,682.2 innings pitched over a 17-year career. Trucks was a two-time All-Star and a two-time league leader in shutouts. In 1952, Trucks became the third major leaguer to throw two no-hitters in a season. After his playing career, Trucks coached for several years in the major leagues. At the time of his death in March 2013, he was one of the oldest living former major league players." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virgil_Trucks> .

Ray has also released a number of solo albums. He is considered an influential player of the Fender Telecaster line of guitars. Fender made two Will Ray signature models in the late 1990s: the Jazz-a-Caster and the Mojo-Tele. G&L is now offering a Will Ray signature model guitar and a less expensive version within their lower cost brand, Tribute by G&L. In July 2005, Ray moved to North Carolina where he built a new state of the art recording studio for production projects. In September 2009, Ray began hosting a weekly music jam in Fletcher, North Carolina at The Feed and Seed.The Tuesday night \"Will Ray Mountain Jam\" encourages local musicians, singer/songwriters to sign up and play with the house band (Will Ray and The Son's of Ralph)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Will_Ray> .

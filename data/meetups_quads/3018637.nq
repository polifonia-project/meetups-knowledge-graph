<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ollie_Halsall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter John \"Ollie\" Halsall (14 March 1949 â€“ 29 May 1992) was an English guitarist best known for his role in the Rutles, the bands Timebox, Patto and Boxer, and for his contribution to the music of Kevin Ayers. He is also notable as one of the few players of the vibraphone in rock music. He was known by his childhood nickname 'Olly' or 'Ollie' which was simply a corruption of his surname. The Ollie Halsall Archive was established in 1998, with the aim of documenting and promoting his work." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ollie_Halsall> .

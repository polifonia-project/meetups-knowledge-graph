A flamboyant showman and electric guitarist in the style of T-Bone Walker, his recording career spanned forty years, and encompassed rhythm and blues, funk and soul music. Watson recorded throughout the 1950s and 1960s with some success. His creative reinvention in the 1970s with funk overtones, saw Watson have hits with \"Ain't That a Bitch\" and \"Superman Lover\". His highest charting single was 1977's \"A Real Mother for Ya\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_%22Guitar%22_Watson> .

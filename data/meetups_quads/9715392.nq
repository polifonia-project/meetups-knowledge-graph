<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathy_Scott> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Cathleen \"Cathy\" Scott (born c. 1950) is a Los Angeles Times bestselling American true crime writer and investigative journalist who penned the biographies and true crime books The Killing of Tupac Shakur and The Murder of Biggie Smalls, both bestsellers in the United States and United Kingdom, and was the first to report Shakur's death. She grew up in La Mesa, California and later moved to Mission Beach, California, where she was a single parent to a son, Raymond Somers Jr. Her hip-hop books are based on the drive-by shootings that killed the rappers six months apart in the midst of what has been called the West Coast-East Coast war. Each book is dedicated to the rappers' mothers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathy_Scott> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zhu_Ci> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Zhu Ci (Chinese: 朱泚; 742–784) was a Chinese military general, monarch, and rebel during the Tang dynasty. He initially served as military governor (Jiedushi) of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), but later became a general for the imperial government. Resentful that he was removed from his command due to the rebellion by his brother Zhu Tao, when Emperor Dezong of Tang fled the capital Chang'an after a mutiny, Zhu Ci declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin (later changed to Han). He was defeated and forced to flee Chang'an in 784 and was killed in flight." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zhu_Ci> .

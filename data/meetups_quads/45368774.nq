He started his career as a dancer. He began his career in rap in 2008 with Lil Golu and Young Amli (now known as Ikka), recording songs and uploading them on social sites. He then started working with Yo Yo Honey Singh as a part of the Mafia Mundeer group. Raftaar later split from the group due to credit-related problems. He was supported by Ankit Khanna, who introduced him to the Punjabi music band RDB, who then signed him onto their label, Three Records.

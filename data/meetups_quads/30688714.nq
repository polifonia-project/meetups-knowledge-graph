<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tawakkol_Karman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Tawakkol Abdel-Salam Khalid Karman (Arabic: توكل عبد السلام خالد كرمان, romanized: Tawakkul 'Abd us-Salām Khalid Karmān; also romanized Tawakul, Tawakel; born 7 February 1979) is a Yemeni Nobel Laureate, journalist, politician, and human rights activist. She leads the group \"Women Journalists Without Chains,\" which she co-founded in 2005. She became the international public face of the 2011 Yemeni uprising that was part of the Arab Spring uprisings. In 2011, she was reportedly called the \"Iron Woman\" and \"Mother of the Revolution\" by some Yemenis. She is a co-recipient of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the first Yemeni, the first Arab woman, and the second Muslim woman to win a Nobel Prize. Karman gained prominence in her country after 2005 in her roles as a Yemeni journalist and an advocate for a mobile phone news service denied a license in 2007, after which she led protests for press freedom. She organized weekly protests after May 2007 expanding the issues for reform. She redirected the Yemeni protests to support the \"Jasmine Revolution,\" as she calls the Arab Spring, after the Tunisian people overthrew the government of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. She was a vocal opponent who called for the end of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tawakkol_Karman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_of_Gareth_Williams> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gareth Wyn Williams (26 September 1978 – c. 16 August 2010) was a Welsh mathematician and employee of GCHQ seconded to the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6) who was found dead in suspicious circumstances at a Security Service safe house flat in Pimlico, London, on 23 August 2010. The inquest found that his death was \"unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated.\" A subsequent Metropolitan Police re-investigation concluded that Williams's death was \"probably an accident\". Two senior British police sources have said some of Williams's work was focused on Russia – and one confirmed reports that he had been helping the US National Security Agency trace international money-laundering routes that are used by organised crime groups including Moscow-based mafia cells." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_of_Gareth_Williams> .

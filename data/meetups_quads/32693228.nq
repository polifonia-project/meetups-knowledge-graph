In May 2011, he had signed a two-year deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music production branch. With this stimulus, he produced singles such as \"Niggas in Paris\" by Jay-Z and Kanye West, \"Trophies\" by Drake, \"Clique\" by GOOD Music, and \"Racks in the Middle\" by Nipsey Hussle featuring Roddy Ricch. \"Racks in the Middle\" won Best Rap Performance at the 2020 Grammy Awards. In December 2012, Hit-Boy signed a recording contract with Interscope Records and subsequently founded his own record label imprint, Hits Since '87. He has since expanded his production catalog with singles such as \"Drop the World\" by Lil Wayne, \"Sorry\" by Beyonc√©, and \"Sicko Mode\" by Travis Scott, all of which have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hit-Boy> .

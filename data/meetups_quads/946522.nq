<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nityananda> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nityānanda (Nityānanda; born circa 1474), also called Nitai, was a primary religious figure within the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition of Bengal. Nitai was Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's friend and disciple. They are often mentioned together as Gaura-Nitai (Gaura, \"golden one\", referring to Chaitanya, Nitai being a shortened form of Nityānanda Rama) or Nimai-Nitai (Nimai being another name of Chaitanya). Followers often refer to Nityānanda as \"Sri Nityananda\", \"Prabhu Nityananda\" or \"Nityananda Rama\". According to Gaudiya-Vaishnava tradition, Nityānanda is an incarnation of Balarama, with Chaitanya being his eternal brother and friend, Krishna. He is considered the \"most merciful\" incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (a term popularised by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami). Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati writes: \"Nityananda is the Primary Manifestive Constituent of the Divinity. Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda, the function is embodied. Nityananda is the Primary Manifestive Constituent of the Divinity. Nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru. In Nityananda, the function is embodied. Nityananda is the servant-God.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nityananda> .

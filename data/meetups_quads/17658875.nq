He was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, and spent most of his life there. When he was 13, he was playing professionally. In 1926 he joined a band led by Harry Shields, then was a member of the New Orleans Owls in 1928. He recorded for the first time in 1936, with Sharkey Bonano, though for his career he was known as a solo pianist. He played dixieland jazz in local clubs and hosted a local television show." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armand_Hug> .

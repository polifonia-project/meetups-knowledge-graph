<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yi_Sun-sin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Admiral Yi Sun-sin (April 28, 1545 – December 16, 1598) was a Korean admiral and military general famed for his victories against the Japanese navy during the Imjin war in the Joseon Dynasty. Over the course of his career, Admiral Yi fought in at least 23 recorded naval engagements, all against the Japanese. In most of these battles, he was outnumbered and lacked necessary supplies. He nonetheless won battle after battle. His most famous victory occurred at the Battle of Myeongnyang, where despite being outnumbered 333 (133 warships, at least 200 logistical support ships) to 13, he managed to disable or destroy 31 Japanese warships without losing a single ship of his own. Yi died from a gunshot wound at the Battle of Noryang on 16 December 1598, the closing battle of the Imjin War. Yi is regarded as one of the greatest naval commanders in history, with commentators praising his strategic vision, intelligence, innovations, and personality. Yi is celebrated as a national hero in Korea, with multiple landmarks, awards and towns named after him, as well as numerous films and documentaries centered on his exploits." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yi_Sun-sin> .

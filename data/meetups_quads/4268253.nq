In a lengthy playing career, Alexander represented Scunthorpe United, Luton Town, Preston North End and Burnley. He also made 40 international appearances for Scotland. For most of his career, Alexander played as a specialist at right-back, but was also deployed in defensive midfield early on in his career with Scunthorpe. He is the fourth oldest player to score in Premier League history. He was also a penalty kick specialist. On 16 April 2011, in Burnley's win over Swansea City in a Championship match, Alexander became only the second outfield player in English football history to have made 1,000 professional appearances, after Tony Ford. He is fourth on the list of footballers in England by number of league appearances. Alexander was appointed manager of Fleetwood Town in December 2012. He won the 2013â€“14 League Two play-offs and promotion to League One, but was sacked by Fleetwood in September 2015. He then managed Scunthorpe United for two years before being appointed manager of newly promoted National League club Salford City on 14 May 2018. Alexander guided Salford to promotion in his first season, but was sacked in October 2020. He then had 18 months as manager of Scottish club Motherwell." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graham_Alexander> .

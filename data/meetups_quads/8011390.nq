<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dickie_Noles> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dickie Ray Noles (born November 19, 1956) is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher with the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers and the Baltimore Orioles between 1979 and 1990. He batted and threw right-handed. Today Noles is a born-again Christian and works for the Philadelphia Phillies. Noles attended Harding University High School in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was selected in the 4th round (84th overall) in the 1975 June amateur baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. Noles was an effective relief pitcher for the Phillies' 1980 World Series championship team. In Game 4 of that series, Noles came on in relief of Larry Christenson in the first inning with only one out and the Phillies down 4–0 to the Kansas City Royals. Noles pitched the next 42⁄3 innings and gave up another run, but is most remembered for throwing a fastball under George Brett's chin in the fourth inning that prompted a warning by the umpires to both teams. Brett struck out in the at-bat and had only three singles and one RBI the remainder of the series. The brushback incident is looked upon as the turning point in that series for the Phillies. Before the 1982 season, Noles was traded along with Keith Moreland to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Mike Krukow and cash. Noles had an effective season as a starter in 1982, going 10–13. In early 1983, however, Noles' alcohol problems began to surface. He and a Cubs teammate drunkenly assaulted a police officer after a game and Noles severely injured his left knee. Noles spent 16 days in jail, was forced to enter alcohol rehabilitation, and was forced to pay a substantial amount of his baseball earnings in an ensuing civil suit. Noles reports that he has been sober since April 9, 1983, the date of the incident. In 1987, Noles became one of only four players in history to be \"traded for himself\" (Harry Chiti, Brad Gulden, and John McDonald are the other three). Toward the end of the season, Noles was traded from the Cubs to the Detroit Tigers for a player to be named later. 33 days later, after the 1987 season had ended, the teams were unable to agree on what player Chicago would receive, and so Noles was shipped back to the Cubs, completing a deal in which he was traded for himself. Two-and-a-half weeks after that, the Cubs granted Noles free agency. He signed with Baltimore for the 1988 season, but only appeared in two games for them. Noles finished his career with a single game for the 1990 Philadelphia Phillies." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dickie_Noles> .

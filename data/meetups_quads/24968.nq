<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Stuyvesant> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Stuyvesant (English: /ˈstaɪvəsənt/; in Dutch also Pieter and Petrus Stuyvesant, Dutch pronunciation: [ˈstœyvəzɑnt]; c. 1610 – August 1672) was a Dutch colonial officer who served as the last Dutch director-general of the colony of New Netherland from 1647 until it was ceded provisionally to the English in 1664, after which it was split into New York and New Jersey with lesser territory becoming parts of other colonies, and later, states. He was a major figure in the early history of New York City and his name has been given to various landmarks and points of interest throughout the city (e.g. Stuyvesant High School, Stuyvesant Town, Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, etc.). Stuyvesant's accomplishments as director-general included a great expansion for the settlement of New Amsterdam beyond the southern tip of Manhattan. Among the projects built by Stuyvesant's administration were the protective wall on Wall Street, the canal that became Broad Street, and Broadway. Stuyvesant, himself a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, opposed religious pluralism and came into conflict with Lutherans, Jews, Roman Catholics, and Quakers as they attempted to build places of worship in the city and practice their faiths. However, Stuyvesant particularly supported antisemitism, and loathed Jews not merely through religion, but also through race." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Stuyvesant> .

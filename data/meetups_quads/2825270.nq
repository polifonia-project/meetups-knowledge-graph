Alexandra's family had been relatively obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was chosen with the consent of the major European powers to succeed his second cousin Frederick VII as king of Denmark. At the age of sixteen Alexandra was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the son and heir apparent of Queen Victoria. The couple married eighteen months later in 1863, the year in which her father became king of Denmark as Christian IX and her brother was appointed king of Greece as George I. Alexandra was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband's family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work. On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albert Edward became king-emperor as Edward VII, with Alexandra as queen-empress. She held the status until Edward's death in 1910, at which point their son George V ascended the throne. Alexandra died aged 80 in 1925." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lyudmila_Karachkina> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina (Russian: Людмила Георгиевна Карачкина, born 3 September 1948, Rostov-on-Don) is an astronomer and discoverer of minor planets. In 1978 she began as a staff astronomer of the Institute for Theoretical Astronomy (ITA) at Leningrad. Her research at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory (CrAO) then focused on astrometry and photometry of minor planets. The Minor Planet Center credits her with the discovery of 130 minor planets, including the Amor asteroid 5324 Lyapunov and the Trojan asteroid 3063 Makhaon. In 2004, she received a Ph.D. in astronomy from Odessa I. I. Mechnikov National University. Lyudmila Karachkina has two daughters, Maria and Renata. The inner main-belt asteroid 8019 Karachkina, discovered by German astronomers Lutz D. Schmadel and Freimut Börngen at Tautenburg on 14 October 1990, was named in her honor (M.P.C. 35489). On 23 November 1999, the minor planet 8089 Yukar was named after her husband, Yurij Vasil'evicht Karachkin (b. 1940), a physics teacher at CrAO's school.(M.P.C. 36946)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sergei_Rachmaninoff> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff (1 April [O.S. 20 March] 1873 – 28 March 1943) was a Russian composer, virtuoso pianist, and conductor. Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly personal idiom notable for its song-like melodicism, expressiveness and rich orchestral colours. The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff's compositional output and he made a point of using his skills as a performer to fully explore the expressive and technical possibilities of the instrument. Born into a musical family, Rachmaninoff took up the piano at the age of four. He studied with Anton Arensky and Sergei Taneyev at the Moscow Conservatory and graduated in 1892, having already composed several piano and orchestral pieces. In 1897, following the disastrous premiere of his Symphony No. 1, Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful supportive therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically received Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1901. In the course of the next sixteen years, Rachmaninoff conducted at the Bolshoi Theatre, relocated to Dresden, Germany, and toured the United States for the first time. Following the Russian Revolution, Rachmaninoff and his family left Russia, and in 1918 they settled in New York City. With his primary source of income coming from performances as a pianist and a conductor, Rachmaninoff had little time to compose. Because of this, he completed just six works between 1918 and 1943, including the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Symphony No. 3, and Symphonic Dances. By 1942, his declining health led to his relocation to Beverly Hills, California, and later became a US citizen a few weeks before he died of advanced melanoma in 1943." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Konstantin_Stanislavski> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski (né Alekseyev; Russian: Константин Сергеевич Станиславский; 17 January [O.S. 5 January] 1863 – 7 August 1938) was a seminal Soviet and Russian theatre practitioner. He was widely recognized as an outstanding character actor and the many productions that he directed garnered him a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his \"system\" of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique. Stanislavski (his stage name) performed and directed as an amateur until the age of 33, when he co-founded the world-famous Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) company with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, following a legendary 18-hour discussion. Its influential tours of Europe (1906) and the US (1923–24), and its landmark productions of The Seagull (1898) and Hamlet (1911–12), established his reputation and opened new possibilities for the art of the theatre. By means of the MAT, Stanislavski was instrumental in promoting the new Russian drama of his day—principally the work of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Mikhail Bulgakov—to audiences in Moscow and around the world; he also staged acclaimed productions of a wide range of classical Russian and European plays. He collaborated with the director and designer Edward Gordon Craig and was formative in the development of several other major practitioners, including Vsevolod Meyerhold (whom Stanislavski considered his \"sole heir in the theatre\"), Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Michael Chekhov. At the MAT's 30-year anniversary celebrations in 1928, a massive heart attack on-stage put an end to his acting career (though he waited until the curtain fell before seeking medical assistance). He continued to direct, teach, and write about acting until his death a few weeks before the publication of the first volume of his life's great work, the acting manual An Actor's Work (1938). He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and the Order of Lenin and was the first to be granted the title of People's Artist of the USSR. Stanislavski wrote that \"there is nothing more tedious than an actor's biography\" and that \"actors should be banned from talking about themselves\". At the request of a US publisher, however, he reluctantly agreed to write his autobiography, My Life in Art (first published in English in 1924 and in a revised, Russian-language edition in 1926), though its account of his artistic development is not always accurate. Three English-language biographies have been published: David Magarshack's Stanislavsky: A Life (1950) ; Jean Benedetti's Stanislavski: His Life and Art (1988, revised and expanded 1999). and Nikolai M Gorchakov's \"Stanislavsky Directs\" (1954). An out-of-print English translation of Elena Poliakova's 1977 Russian biography of Stanislavski was also published in 1982." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

Her murder following the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. During her lifetime, Maria, too young to become a Red Cross nurse like her elder sisters during World War I, was patroness of a hospital and instead visited wounded soldiers. Throughout her lifetime she was noted for her interest in the lives of the soldiers. The flirtatious Maria had a number of innocent crushes on the young men she met, beginning in early childhood. She hoped to marry and have a large family. She was an elder sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, whose alleged escape from the assassination of the imperial family was rumored for nearly 90 years. However, it was later proven that Anastasia did not escape and that those who claimed to be her were imposters. In the 1990s, it was suggested that Maria might have been the grand duchess whose remains were missing from the Romanov grave that was discovered near Yekaterinburg, Russia and exhumed in 1991. Further remains were discovered in 2007, and DNA analysis subsequently proved that the entire Imperial family had been murdered in 1918. A funeral for the remains of Maria and Alexei to be buried with their family in October 2015 was postponed indefinitely by the Russian Orthodox Church, which took custody of the remains in December and declared without explanation that the case required further study; the 44 partial bone fragments remain stored in a Russian state repository." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Irina_Nijinska> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Irina Nijinska (20 November 1913 – 2 July 1991) was a Russian-Polish ballet dancer who performed with the company of Ida Rubinstein; in the Théatre de la Danse Nijinska; the Ballets Russes of Col. de Basil; the Polish Ballet, and other troupes. She spent much of her later life promoting the work of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, the dancer and choreographer. Irina Nijinska was born in St Petersburg, the daughter of Nijinska and dancer Alexander Kotchetovsky. Her uncle was the world famous dancer Vaslav Nijinsky; and her grandparents were dancers Thomas Nijinsky and Eleanora Bereda. After her brother Leo was born in Kiev in 1919, her parents separated. Her mother took her two children west in 1921, eventually settling in France. Irina trained as a dancer in Paris, studying with Vera Trefilova and Eugene Lapitsky, and beginning pointe work with her grandmother. She made her debut with Olga Spessivtzeva's troupe in 1930 and went on to dance in many of the dance troupes with which her mother was associated, performing under the stage name Irina Istomina. Among other parts, she performed her mother's old role as the Street Dancer in Petrouchka. Like her relatives, she became known for the height of her jumps. In 1935 she was forced to interrupt her dancing career after suffering injuries in a car accident that killed her brother, Leo. During her convalescence, Irina first became an assistant to her mother, helping to stage the ballet Les Noces for Col. de Basil's Ballets Russes, in New York in 1936; and the ballet Le Baiser de la Fée in Buenos Aires. Much later, she helped her mother revive \"Les Biches\" for the Teatro dell'Opera in Rome in 1969; and for the Teatro Comunale in Florence in 1970. Mother and daughter moved to Los Angeles in 1940, where both began teaching. She taught at Nijinska's Hollywood Dance Studio from 1941-1950. Following her mother's death in 1972, Irina co-edited and co-translated the first part of Bronislava's autobiography,, Early Memoirs, with Jean Rawlinson. She made the publishing arrangements and it appeared in 1981, being named a Notable Book of 1981 by the American Library Association. She also continued working with the revivals of Bronislava's original choreographies, produced at different ballet-company venues. By her own estimate, between 1972 and 1991 Irina Nijinska produced 26 stagings for 20 different ballet companies in Europe, America, and Asia. Oakland Ballet's production of \"Les Noces\" in 1981 saw the first American performances of Nijinska's ballet since 1936. Irina also staged Les Biches for Oakland Ballet in 1982; and assisted Frank W.D. Ries, a Jean Cocteau scholar, in the reconstruction of Le Train Bleu in Oakland, in 1989. She developed close ties with the Dance Theatre of Harlem, in New York, where she staged \"Les Biches\" in 1983, and in 1989 staged a full evening of works by Bronislava Nijinska including \"Les Biches,\" \"Les Noces,\" and \"Rondo Capriccioso,\" the latter reconstructed with the assistance of Rosella Hightower. Irina's staging of \"Les Noces\" for the Feld Ballet, in 1985, was notable for the design of a new set by Ming Cho Lee. In 1990, Irina revived the Bride's Variation from \"Le Baiser de la Fée\" for a conference sponsored by the Dance Critics Association. That performance featured a young Jennie Somogyi, later a principal dancer with New York City Ballet. Irina Nijinska was also instrumental in promoting her mother's works through her involvement in two historic museum exhibitions. \"Bronislava Nijinska: a Dancer's Legacy,\" was curated by Nancy Van Norman Baer and first seen at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, from March to July of1986, then at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, from September 1986 to January 1987. \"La Nijinska: Choreographer, Dancer, Teacher\" was curated by Madeleine Nichols and exhibited at the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library, from December 1990 through April 1991, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Bronislava Nijinska's birth. In 1946 Irina had married Gibbs S. Raetz; they had two children, Natalie and George. In 1991 at age 77, Irina Nijinska died in a hospital room in Inglewood after suffering a stroke on May 29, in Amsterdam. Family members, friends, and colleagues gathered to pay tribute to her at a symposium at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts in November 1991." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

Charles entered Cornell University in 1909, earning a Bachelor of Science in 1913 and a Ph.D. in 1918. Between 1917 and 1919, he was entomologist at the University of Kansas, then from 1919 to 1922, at the University of Illinois. He then became professor of entomology at Massachusetts Agricultural College at Amherst. He studied Diptera, especially in the family Tipulidae. He described over 11,000 species and genera of flies, which translates to approximately a species description a day for his entire career. In 1920, C.P.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alexander III of Macedon (Ancient Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος, romanized: Alexandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon. He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20, and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt. By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders. Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon, he campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted control over Thrace and Illyria before marching on the city of Thebes, which was subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of Corinth, and used his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father, assuming leadership over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years. Following his conquest of Asia Minor, Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive battles, including those at Issus and Gaugamela; he subsequently overthrew Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. After the fall of Persia, the Macedonian Empire held a vast swath of territory between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River. Alexander endeavored to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, achieving an important victory over Porus, an ancient Indian king of present-day Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Due to the demand of his homesick troops, he eventually turned back at the Beas River and later died in 323 BC in Babylon, the city of Mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empire's capital. Alexander's death left unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a Greek invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars broke out across the Macedonian Empire, eventually leading to its disintegration at the hands of the Diadochi. With his death marking the start of the Hellenistic period, Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism. He founded more than twenty cities that bore his name, with the most prominent being the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of Hellenistic civilization and influence as far east as the Indian subcontinent. The Hellenistic period developed through the Roman Empire into modern Western culture; the Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire up until its collapse in the mid-15th century AD. Greek-speaking communities in central Anatolia and in far-eastern Anatolia survived until the Greek genocide of the 1910s and early 1920s as well as the Greek–Turkish population exchange of the mid-1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, featuring prominently in the historical and mythical traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. His military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves, and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

In 1920s Berlin, Dietrich performed on the stage and in silent films. Her performance as Lola-Lola in Josef von Sternberg's The Blue Angel (1930) brought her international acclaim and a contract with Paramount Pictures. She starred in many Hollywood films, including six iconic roles directed by Sternberg: Morocco (1930) (her only Academy Award nomination), Dishonored (1931), Shanghai Express and Blonde Venus (both 1932), The Scarlet Empress (1934) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935), Desire (1936) and Destry Rides Again (1939). She successfully traded on her glamorous persona and exotic looks, and became one of the era's highest-paid actresses. Throughout World War II she was a high-profile entertainer in the United States. Although she delivered notable performances in several post-war films, including Billy Wilder's A Foreign Affair (1948), Alfred Hitchcock's Stage Fright (1950), Billy Wilder's Witness for the Prosecution (1957), Orson Welles's Touch of Evil (1958) and Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), she spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer. Dietrich was known for her humanitarian efforts during World War II, housing German and French exiles, providing financial support and even advocating their American citizenship. For her work on improving morale on the front lines during the war, she received several honors from the United States, France, Belgium and Israel. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth greatest female screen legend of classic Hollywood cinema." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Vertinsky> .

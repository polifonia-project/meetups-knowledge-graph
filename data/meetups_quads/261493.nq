<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Dibdin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Dibdin (before 4 March 1745 â€“ 25 July 1814) was an English composer, musician, dramatist, novelist, singer and actor. With over 600 songs to his name, for many of which he wrote both the lyrics and the music and performed them himself, he was in his time the most prolific English singer-songwriter. He is best known as the composer of \"Tom Bowling\", one of his many sea songs, which often features at the Last Night of the Proms. He also wrote about 30 dramatic pieces, including the operas The Waterman (1774) and The Quaker (1775), and several novels, memoirs and histories. His works were admired by Haydn and Beethoven." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Dibdin> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euan_Macdonald> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Euan Macdonald (born 1965, Edinburgh, Scotland) is an artist based in Los Angeles. He has exhibited internationally, including La Biennale de Montréal in 2000 and International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Seville in 2005. In 2008, his video, SCLPTR (2005), was included in California Video at the Getty Center, curated by Glenn Phillips. Macdonald's videos, drawings and sculptures are informed by philosophical, musical, literary and popular references. They often depict everyday scenes while examining landscape, entropy, stillness, noise, and duration. In his essay Responsiveness Testing, Ralph Rugoff, director of the Hayward Gallery, London, writes: \"Macdonald quietly unsettles the viewers faith about what exactly is - or is not - happening in the picture he or she is looking at. ... These pockets of uncertainty are enhanced by Macdonald’s deliberately style-less or impersonal approach to making images.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euan_Macdonald> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Johnson_(fighter)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Anthony Kewoa Johnson (March 6, 1984 â€“ November 13, 2022) was an American mixed martial artist. He spent most of his career competing for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he was a multiple time title challenger, before ending his career with a single fight with Bellator MMA. He fought in the welterweight, middleweight, light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions. He was known by his nickname, Rumble, which he was given because of his one-punch knockout power. He also had a small acting role as a fighter in a large international mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta in the 2011 film Warrior. He was the number 1 ranked light heavyweight contender in official UFC rankings, and was ranked number 2 in the world by Sherdog and ESPN, before his retirement in April 2017. Johnson later came out of retirement in May 2021 and won his last fight by knockout." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Johnson_(fighter)> .

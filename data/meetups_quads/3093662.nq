<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Westall> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Robert Atkinson Westall (7 October 1929 â€“ 15 April 1993) was an English author and teacher known for fiction aimed at children and young people. Some of the latter cover complex, dark, and adult themes. He has been called \"the dean of British war novelists\". His first book, The Machine Gunners, won the 1975 Carnegie Medal for the year's outstanding children's book by a British subject. It was named among the top ten Medal-winners at the 70th anniversary celebration in 2007. Westall also won a second Carnegie (no one has yet won three), a Smarties Prize, and the once-in-a-lifetime Guardian Prize." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Westall> .

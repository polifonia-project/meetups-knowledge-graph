<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rudolph_Schindler_(architect)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rudolph Michael Schindler (born Rudolf Michael Schlesinger (September 10, 1887 - August 22, 1953) was an Austrian-born American architect whose most important works were built in or near Los Angeles during the early to mid-twentieth century. Although he worked and trained with some of its foremost practitioners, he often is associated with the fringes of the modernist movement in architecture. His use of complex three-dimensional forms, \"warm\" materials, and striking colors, as well as his ability to work within tight budgets, however, have placed him as one of the mavericks of early twentieth century architecture. Reyner Banham said he designed \"as if there had never been houses before.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rudolph_Schindler_(architect)> .

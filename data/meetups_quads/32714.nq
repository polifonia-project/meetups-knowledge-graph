<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vince_Foster> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Vincent Walker Foster Jr. (January 15, 1945 â€“ July 20, 1993) was an American attorney who served as deputy White House counsel during the first six months of the Clinton administration. Foster had been a partner at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where, as The Washington Post later wrote, he rose to \"the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment.\" At the White House, he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression, and in July 1993, he was found dead of a gunshot wound in Fort Marcy Park. Five official governmental investigations ruled his death a suicide, but several conspiracy theories emerged." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vince_Foster> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Watson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frederick Garnett \"Fred\" Watson AM (born 14 December) is an English-born astronomer and popular scientist in Australia. He holds the role of Australia's First Astronomer at Large with the Commonwealth Government of Australia, relaying the important aspects of Australian astronomy to the government, the general public, and associated organisations. In 1995 Watson became astronomer in charge of the Australian Astronomical Observatory, but is best known for his work with science outreach, for which he has written many books, as well as musical and choral works. On top of his many nationwide radio slots with the ABC, Watson has also been a frequent guest on The Project. In January 2010, Watson was made a member of the Order of Australia for service to astronomy, particularly the promotion and popularisation of space science through public outreach." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Watson> .

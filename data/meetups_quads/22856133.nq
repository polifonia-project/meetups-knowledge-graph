She has been described as \"a worthy successor to Dame Nellie Melba and Dame Joan Sutherland\" and was sometimes known as \"the other Joan\" (a reference to Sutherland and Dame Joan Hammond) or \"The People's Diva\". She was a Principal Soprano with Opera Australia for 32 years, and was particularly associated with the title roles of Giacomo Puccini's Tosca and Madama Butterfly. However, she sang over 50 other roles, from the 18th century, including virtually all the Mozart heroines, through to works by contemporary composers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joan_Carden> .

Besides his solo career he was also a member of the pop group Estraden. He names his musical influences as Eagle-Eye Cherry, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Westlife, ABBA, Max Martin, Bon Iver and Queen, in particular Freddie Mercury. Cavazza is well known as a good friend of the Swedish producer Avicii. Together they made two songs (\"Gonna Love Ya\" and \"Sunset Jesus\") for Avicii's album Stories. Cavazza also features on \"Without You\" which was nominated for a Grammis in 2017. During a road-trip through America, Avicii and Cavazza made multiple songs together. After Avicii's death in 2018, only \"Forever Yours\" was released in 2020, after it was finished by the Norwegian producer Kygo." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sandro_Cavazza> .

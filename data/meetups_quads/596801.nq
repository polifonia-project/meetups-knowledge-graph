<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Carroll> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Peter Clay Carroll (born September 15, 1951) is an American football coach who is the head coach and executive vice president for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He was previously the head football coach at USC from 2000 to 2009, where he won six bowl games and back to back National Championships in 2003 and 2004. Beginning his head coaching career on the professional level, Carroll saw minimal success with the New York Jets in 1994 and New England Patriots from 1997 to 1999. Shifting to college football with USC, he revitalized the struggling program into a top-ranked contender. Carroll's collegiate success prompted an NFL return in 2010 when he was hired as the head coach of Seattle. Under Carroll, the Seahawks have qualified for the playoffs nine times, clinched their division five times, made two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and won the franchise's first championship in Super Bowl XLVIII. The team's Legion of Boom defense also led the league in scoring for four consecutive seasons during his tenure. Carroll is one of three head coaches (alongside Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Carroll> .

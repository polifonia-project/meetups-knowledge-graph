Hawkshaw worked extensively for the KPM production music company in the 1950s to the 1970s, composing and recording many stock tracks that have been used extensively in film and TV. He was the composer of a number of theme tunes including Grange Hill (originally library music recorded in Munich known as \"Chicken Man\") and Countdown. In addition, he was an arranger and pianist, and in the United States with the studio group Love De-Luxe scored a number 1 single on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart with \"Here Comes That Sound Again\" in 1979.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dylan_Walker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dylan Walker (born 27 September 1994) is a professional rugby league footballer who plays as a centre and five-eighth for the New Zealand Warriors in the NRL, and has played for Australia and the New Zealand Maori at international level. He previously played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, with whom he won the 2014 NRL Premiership and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Walker has played at representative level for City Origin, NRL All Stars, New South Wales and the Prime Minister's XIII. Following his arrest in December 2018 for the alleged assault of his fianc√©e, Walker was stood down by Manly and later the NRL. On 10 May 2019 the charges were dismissed and he was cleared to resume playing." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dylan_Walker> .

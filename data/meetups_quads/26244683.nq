He subsequently worked for many other record labels. It was said that \"The result of his painstaking efforts is the restoration of much of the 20th century's most indelible music, now preserved for future generations and sounding better than ever before.\" In 1981, he started to broadcast Portraits In Blue, a syndicated radio program covering blues, R&B and soul music, which he launched at WBGO in Newark, New Jersey. He received the 1986 W. C. Handy Award.

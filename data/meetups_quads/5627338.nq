<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beryl_Gilroy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Beryl Agatha Gilroy (née Answick; 30 August 1924 – 4 April 2001) was a Guyanese educator, novelist, ethno-psychotherapist, and poet. The Guardian described her as \"one of Britain's most significant post-war Caribbean migrants.\" She emigrated to London in 1951 as part of the Windrush generation to attend the University of London, then spend decades teaching, writing, and improving education. She worked primarily with Black women and children as a psychotherapist and her children's books are lauded as some of the first representations of Black London. She is perhaps best known as the first Black head teacher in London." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beryl_Gilroy> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Cameron_of_Lochiel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Donald Cameron of Lochiel (c. 1695 – 1748), popularly known as the Gentle Lochiel, was a Scottish Jacobite and hereditary chief of Clan Cameron, traditionally loyal to the exiled House of Stuart. His father John was permanently exiled after the 1715 Rising and when his grandfather Sir Ewen Cameron died in 1719, Donald assumed his duties as Lochiel of the Camerons. Despite considerable misgivings, Lochiel's support for Prince Charles Edward Stuart proved pivotal in the early stages of the 1745 Jacobite Rising. The Camerons held a strategic importance out of proportion to numbers due to the compact nature of their lands and ability to act as a cohesive unit; in contrast, many of their rivals were scattered across different areas and riven by internal feuds. Defeated and wounded at the Battle of Culloden, Lochiel and Prince Charles escaped to France, fleeing from Lochaber in late 1746, in company with other senior Jacobites. He was appointed Colonel of the Régiment d'Albanie and commander of the Garde Écossaise by Louis XV. Lochiel was also made a member of Order of Saint Michael. He died in Bergues, French Flanders on 23 October 1748." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Donald_Cameron_of_Lochiel> .

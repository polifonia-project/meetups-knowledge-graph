<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hal_Draper> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hal Draper (born Harold Dubinsky; September 19, 1914 â€“ January 26, 1990) was an American socialist activist and author who played a significant role in the Berkeley, California, Free Speech Movement. He is known for his extensive scholarship on the history and meaning of the thought of Karl Marx. Draper was a lifelong advocate of what he called \"socialism from below\", that is, self-emancipation by the working class, in opposition to capitalism and Stalinist bureaucracy. He was one of the creators of the Third Camp tradition, a form of Marxist socialism." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hal_Draper> .

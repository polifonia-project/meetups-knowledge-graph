<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hideaki_Tokunaga> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Hideaki Tokunaga (德永 英明, Tokunaga Hideaki, born February 27, 1961 in Yanagawa, Fukuoka) is a Japanese pop singer-songwriter and actor. Although Tokunaga failed to pass the test of Star Tanjō! in 1982, he debuted as a recording singer in 1986. After he released hit songs such as \"Yume o Shinjite\" (the first ending theme of the anime series Dragon Quest) and \"Kowarekake no Radio\" in 1990, his single \"Wednesday Moon\" reached No. 1 on Oricon weekly charts in 1991. He was also known for Vocalist album series, comprising his covers of female songs. Vocalist, Vocalist 2, Vocalist 3 and Vocalist 4 were released in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2010 respectively. Tokunaga is the first male artist to have at least one album to reach the number-one position on the Japanese Oricon weekly charts for four decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s). Tokunaga also composed other singers' songs such as KinKi Kids' \"Eien Ni\" (from their 2007 album Phi). Tokunaga gained high popularity in Hong Kong due to huge number of songs covered in Cantonese version by superstars such as Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Jackie Cheung, and Leon Lai." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hideaki_Tokunaga> .

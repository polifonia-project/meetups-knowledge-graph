<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Dicterow> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Glenn Dicterow (born December 23, 1948), is an American violinist and former concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He is on the faculty of the University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music where he holds the Jascha Heifetz Chair in Violin as well as serving as a faculty artist at the Music Academy of the West. Dicterow's musical gifts became apparent when, at age 11, he made his solo debut with the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Harold Dicterow, his father, served as principal of the second violin section in the Los Angeles Philharmonic for 52 years. Over the following years, Dicterow became one of the most sought-after young violinists, appearing as soloist from coast to coast. Dicterow went on to win numerous awards and competitions, including the Young Musicians Foundation Award and Coleman Award (Los Angeles), The Julia Klumpke Award (San Francisco), and the Bronze Medal in the International Tchaikovsky Competition (1970). He is a graduate of The Juilliard School, where he was a student of Ivan Galamian. Other teachers have included Erno Neufeld, Eudice Shapiro, Naoum Blinder, Manuel Compinsky, Jascha Heifetz and Henryk Szeryng." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenn_Dicterow> .

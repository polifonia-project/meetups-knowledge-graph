He has sold 14 million records worldwide and has released 12 studio albums as well as several compilation albums which have included his previous hits in a reworked format. BoBo has also released 34 singles, some of which have charted high not only in German speaking countries, but also in other European territories. As a dance music producer, his first big success came with the single \"Somebody Dance with Me\", which borrows its melody from Rockwell's \"Somebody's Watching Me\". BoBo charted with the singles \"Keep on Dancing\", \"Take Control\", \"Everybody\", \"Let the Dream Come True\", \"Love Is All Around\", \"Freedom\", \"Pray\", and \"What a Feeling\", as well as \"Chihuahua\", almost all of which comprised fast-paced Eurodance sound with female vocals and rap verses performed by BoBo. Between 1992 and 2007, he had 27 single chart hits in Switzerland and Germany and has won ten World Music Awards for being Switzerland's best selling artist. BoBo has received numerous Gold and Platinum certifications for his releases and has found success in Europe (primarily Germany and Switzerland), Asia, and South America." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/DJ_BoBo> .

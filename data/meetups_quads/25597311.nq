<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Mayes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pete Mayes (born Floyd Davis Mayes, March 21, 1938 â€“ December 16, 2008) was an American Texas blues singer, guitarist and songwriter. He was variously known as Texas Pete Mayes and T-Bone Man (because his guitar playing resembled that of his hero T-Bone Walker). Mayes made few recordings but For Pete's Sake was released in 1998, nearly fifty years after he first appeared on stage. It was his most widely distributed recording and won the Blues Foundation's W. C. Handy Award in the category Comeback Album of the Year." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Mayes> .

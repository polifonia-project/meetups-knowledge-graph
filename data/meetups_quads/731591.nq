<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heather_Langenkamp> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Heather Elizabeth Langenkamp (born July 17, 1964) is an American actress. She is considered an influential figure in horror films and in popular culture, noted for her acting in several works of the genre and her behind-the-scenes work coordinating prosthetic makeup. She is established as a scream queen, and was inducted into the Fangoria Chainsaw Hall of Fame in 1995. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to an artist and a petroleum attorney, Langenkamp spent her childhood on a farm. While working for the Tulsa Tribune at the age of 19, she got cast as an extra in Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders (1983) and Rumble Fish (1983), and whilst attending Stanford University, she played her first leading role in the little-seen Nickel Mountain (1984). Langenkamp earned widespread recognition for headlining Wes Craven's slasher film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) as the resourceful 15-year-old heroine Nancy Thompson. The film emerged as a critical and commercial success and spawned the similarly-titled franchise, in which Langenkamp reprises the role of Nancy for its third installment, Dream Warriors (1987). Her final appearance in the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise was the self-aware horror film Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994), where she received acclaim for playing both a fictionalized version of herself and Nancy. Langenkamp has starred in numerous television series and made-for-television films throughout her career such as the drama film Passions (1984), the Emmy Award–winning ABC sitcoms Growing Pains (1988–1990) and Just the Ten of Us (1988–1990), the satirical film Tonya and Nancy: The Inside Story (1994), the anthology series Perversions of Science (1997), the Syfy–film Truth or Dare (2017), the adult animated series JJ Villard's Fairy Tales (2020), and the Mike Flanagan created Netflix series The Midnight Club (2022). Her further film roles include The Butterfly Room (2012), Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), Cottonmouth (2020) and My Little Pony: A New Generation (2021). She has expanded her career, and has worked as the special makeup effects coordinator for movies such as Dawn of the Dead (2004), Cinderella Man (2005), Evan Almighty (2007), and The Cabin in the Woods (2012). Langenkamp met her husband, Oscar-winning make-up artist David LeRoy Anderson, at a wrap party for Wes Craven's The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) and together they run the make-up FX firm AFX Studio." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heather_Langenkamp> .

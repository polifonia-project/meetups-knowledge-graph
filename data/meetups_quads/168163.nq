<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maurice_Gibb> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Maurice Ernest Gibb CBE (/ˈmɒrɪs/; 22 December 1949 – 12 January 2003) was a British musician. He achieved fame as a member of the pop group Bee Gees. Although his elder brother Barry Gibb and fraternal twin brother Robin Gibb were the group's main lead singers, most of their albums included at least one or two songs featuring Maurice's lead vocals, including \"Lay It on Me\", \"Country Woman\" and \"On Time\". The Bee Gees were one of the most successful pop-rock groups of all time. Gibb started his music career in 1955 in Manchester, England at the age of six joining the skiffle-rock and roll group the Rattlesnakes, which later evolved into the Bee Gees in 1958 after spending three years in Manchester when they moved to Australia. They returned to England, where they achieved worldwide fame. In 2002, the Bee Gees were appointed as CBEs for their \"contribution to music\". Following Gibb's unexpected death in 2003, his son collected his award at Buckingham Palace in 2004. Maurice Gibb's earliest musical influences included the Everly Brothers, Cliff Richard, and Paul Anka; the Mills Brothers and the Beatles were significant later influences. During the Bee Gees' temporary break-up in 1969–1970, Maurice released his first solo single, \"Railroad\", but his first solo album, The Loner, has never been released." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maurice_Gibb> .

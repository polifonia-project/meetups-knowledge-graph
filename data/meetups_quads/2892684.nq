Robinson is remembered for his music, including the cantata \"Ballad for Americans\" and songs such as \"Joe Hill\" and \"Black and White\", which expressed his left-leaning political views. He wrote many popular songs and music for Hollywood films, including his collaboration with Lewis Allan on the 1940s hit \"The House I Live In\" from the Academy Award winning film of the same name. He was a member of the Communist Party from the 1930s to the 1950s. The jazz clarinetist Perry Robinson (1938–2018) was his son." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earl_Robinson> .

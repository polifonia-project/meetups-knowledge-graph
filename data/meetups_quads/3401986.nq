<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Lacy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeffrey Scott Lacy (born May 12, 1977) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2015. He held the IBF super middleweight title from 2004 to 2006, and the IBO super middleweight title from 2005 to 2006. Lacy rose to prominence in the early to mid-2000s as a feared puncher in the division, with his physique and knockout record making him one of boxing's top-rated prospects at the time." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Lacy> .

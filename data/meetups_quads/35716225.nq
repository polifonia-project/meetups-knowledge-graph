<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Redgate> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jim Redgate is an Australian classical guitar luthier, who owns Redgate Guitars. As of 2012, he makes four models, the lattice-braced, the double-top, and the new wave double-top and traditional fan-braced. His customers include Pepe Romero, Ana VidoviÄ‡, Ralph Towner, Slava Grigoryan, Leonard Grigoryan, Bertrand Thomas, Jeff Young, Gareth Koch, Odair Assad, Wolfgang Muthspiel, Karin Schaupp, Emmanuel Rossfelder, , and . One author said of him, \"Like fellow Australian Greg Smallman, Redgate builds his (lattice-braced) guitars with an arched back to improve their volume and projection, and he uses lightweight carbon fiber reinforcements under the soundboard. While not as thin as a Smallman's, Redgate's soundboards are much lighter than traditionally braced examples, and his guitars are therefore more responsive, energy efficient, and louder than traditional classical instruments.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Redgate> .

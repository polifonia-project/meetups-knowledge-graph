Fiala is the nephew of Franz and her husband, filmmaker Ulrich Seidl. Franz, a former film journalist, began her film career co-writing with Seidl. Franz and Fiala began their creative partnership writing and directing Kern (2012), a documentary about the actor Peter Kern. They went on to gain international notice for their feature debut, the German-language psychological horror film Goodnight Mommy (2014), which was selected as the Austrian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards. They subsequently wrote and directed a segment of the anthology horror film The Field Guide to Evil (2018), followed by the English-language psychological horror film The Lodge (2019)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Veronika_Franz_and_Severin_Fiala> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanjaya_Malakar> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sanjaya Joseph Malakar (born September 10, 1989) is an American singer, who was a finalist on the sixth season of American Idol. He gained national attention on the series, controversially advancing to 7th place with public votes, despite being poorly received by the show's judges, particularly Simon Cowell, as well as through Howard Stern, who asked his listeners to vote to keep Sanjaya on the show. After Idol, Malakar made many television guest appearances and has been commonly parodied in popular culture. He placed fifth in second season of the reality television show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanjaya_Malakar> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder_of_Tori_Stafford> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Victoria Elizabeth Marie \"Tori\" Stafford (July 15, 2000 â€“ April 8, 2009) was a Canadian girl who was abducted, raped, and murdered by Michael Rafferty and Terri-Lynne McClintic. Her body was found three months later in a wooded area in rural Ontario. Her disappearance, and the subsequent investigation and search, were the subject of massive media coverage across Canada. The police response to the situation as it developed, as well as their failure to announce an AMBER Alert was criticized by the public, and has been the focus of a review of the Amber Alert system in Canada. The circumstances of her death were unknown to the public until a publication ban was lifted in December 2010." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder_of_Tori_Stafford> .

He is a graduate of University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he attended with a full music scholarship. He is signed to Peak Records. Although originally from Denver, Colorado, he is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. He has worked extensively with Keiko Matsui and played as a special guest with the Rippingtons for a short time in 1999 and 2000, after Jeff Kashiwa left the group and before Eric Marienthal joined them. He collaborated with many R&B vocalists such as LaToya London, Regina Belle, Maxi Priest, Peabo Bryson and Terry Dexter. His reedy tone and warm, bright sound frame dynamic, danceable grooves and intricate pop shot through with electronica." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Taylor_(saxophonist)> .

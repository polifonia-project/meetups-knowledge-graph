He is the current head coach of Lega Pro Seconda Divisione team Castel Rigone. During his club career he played for Como, Sampdoria, Napoli, Torino and Juventus. He earned 8 caps for the Italy national football team and took part in the 1988 UEFA European Football Championship. He was known as an intelligent, hardworking, tactically versatile, and correct player throughout his career, with good technique and determination, and could also play as a sweeper, a role in which he was frequently deployed in his later career, following his athletic decline, due to his playmaking ability." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luca_Fusi> .

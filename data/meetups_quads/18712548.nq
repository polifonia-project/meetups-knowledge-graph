His music mixes traditional Swedish folk music, rock music, electroacoustics and improvisation. In 2002 his composition Calm Like a Bomb won second prize in Category B: electroacoustic music with voice or instruments in the 24th Russolo Composers Competition, and this piece was released on a CD together with music by the other prizewinners (Anon. 2003, 6). The following year he was a finalist in Category A: electroacoustic music, of the same competition (Anon. 2004, 7). He was Composer in Residence at SR P2, Swedish Radio’s serious music channel, from 2004 to 2006. \"Residues\", released in 2006 by Swedish Radio, has been hailed as a \"milestone for contemporary music lovers\" in France and as \"a central album of the Swedish music from the first decade of the 21st century\" in Swedish press.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pop_Wansel> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel (born April 27, 1988) is an American record producer, musician and songwriter from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As the son of Philadelphia soul musician Dexter Wansel, Pop grew up in the music industry and began writing and producing his own music at the age of ten, citing rapper Nas and Motown songwriting team Holland–Dozier–Holland as his early inspirations. In 2006, Pop reached out to Nicki Minaj via Myspace message looking to collaborate. After her initial interest, he sent her an idea that would eventually become the basis for \"Your Love\". Nicki recorded the track and the unmastered demo subsequently leaked in 2009, landing at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Rap Songs." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pop_Wansel> .

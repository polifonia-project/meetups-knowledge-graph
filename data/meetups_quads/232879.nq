<http://dbpedia.org/resource/F._J._Robinson,_1st_Viscount_Goderich> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon, PC (1 November 1782 – 28 January 1859), styled The Honourable F. J. Robinson until 1827 and known between 1827 and 1833 as The Viscount Goderich (pronounced /ˈɡoʊdrɪtʃ/ GOHdrich), the name by which he is best known to history, was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1827 to 1828. A member of the rural landowning aristocracy, Robinson entered politics through family connections. In the House of Commons, he rose through junior ministerial ranks, achieving cabinet office in 1818 as President of the Board of Trade. In 1823, he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post he held for four years. In 1827, he was raised to the peerage, and in the House of Lords was Leader of the House and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. In 1827, Prime Minister George Canning died after only 119 days in office, and Goderich succeeded him. But he was unable to hold together Canning's fragile coalition of moderate Tories and Whigs, and he himself resigned after only 144 days. Canning and Goderich were the two shortest ruling Prime Ministers in British history, until Liz Truss in 2022. After leaving the premiership Goderich served in the cabinets of two of his successors, the Earl Grey and Sir Robert Peel." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/F._J._Robinson,_1st_Viscount_Goderich> .

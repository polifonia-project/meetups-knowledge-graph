She is the daughter of jazz musician John L. Nelson (1916–2001) and jazz singer Mattie Della Shaw (1933–2002), and the sister of Prince (1958–2016). In addition, she has seven half-siblings. She has released four albums, and reached No. 33 on the Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in July 1988 with \"Marc Anthony's Tune\", produced by Larry Graham. She wrote the tune \"Marc Anthony\" because she had a crush on the singer. She accepted Prince's American Music Award for Top Soundtrack following his death in 2016. Nelson is married to Maurice Phillips. She has 6 children." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyka_Nelson> .

Born and raised in Split, Croatia, Rozga was a ballet dancer as a child. She rose to fame in 1996, when she became the lead singer of Magazin, a pop band famous in Croatia. She served as the band's lead singer until 2006, releasing a total of five studio albums. During the ten years, the band released numerous commercially and critically successful singles including \"Ginem\", \"Minut' srca tvog\" and \"Minus i plus\" among others. In 2006, Rozga launched a solo career with the release of her debut studio album Oprosti Mala (English: Sorry Baby). The album was a major commercial and critical success that established her status as a solo artist. It peaked on top of the Croatian Albums Chart and produced several commercially successful singles, including \"Gospe moja\" (English: My Lady), \"Oprosti mala\" (English: Sorry Baby), and \"Ne zovi me Marija\" (English: Don't Call Me Marija). Rozga's second studio album Bižuterija (2011; English: Bijouterie) produced the eponymous number-one lead single as well as singles \"Rodit ću ti 'ćer i sina\" (English: I Will Give Birth to Your Daughter and Son) and \"Ona ili ja\" (English: Her or me). In support of the album, Rozga launched her first headlining tour, The Bižuterija Tour (2010–2012). She became the first Croatian female artist ever to sell out a concert at the Spaladium Arena. Moderna žena (English: Modern Woman), the singer's third studio album, was released in 2016, and featured some of her most famous singles as a solo artist to date, including \"Nirvana\", \"Kraljica\" (English: Queen), and \"Tsunami\". Moderna žena was Rozga's third studio album to top the Croatian Albums Chart and to receive a gold certification by the Croatian Phonographic Association. It further became the best-selling album of the year in Croatia. On 14 November 2022, Rozga released her first acoustic compilation album Minut Srca Mog. She will embark on the regional Minut Srca Mog Tour (2022-23) in its promotion. In addition to her singing career, Rozga also shortly ventured in acting and voiceovers. She is considered to be one of the most famous singers in Croatia, having received gold certifications for three solo albums and having won numerous awards, including the Grand Prix award at the Split Festival. She has also enjoyed wider regional success and popularity in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Slovenia." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jelena_Rozga> .

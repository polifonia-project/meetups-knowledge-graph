<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthew_Decker> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet (1679 â€“ 18 March 1749) (Dutch: Mattijs Decker) of Richmond Green in Surrey, was a Dutch-born English merchant and economist who served as a Member of Parliament for Bishop's Castle in Shropshire from 1719 to 1722. He was a governor of the South Sea Company from 1711 to 1712, and a Director of the East India Company from 1713 to 1743. His published works show him as \"such a strong supporter of the doctrine of free trade as to rank as one of the most important forerunners of Adam Smith\", proposed amongst other measures, to abolish customs duties and replace them with a tax upon houses, to abolish the duty on tea replacing it with a licence duty on households wishing to consume it, and to repeal import duties and bounties in general. At his house in Richmond, he amassed a large collection of art, including many Dutch paintings, which later formed the core of the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum, founded by his grandson. He was a pioneer in the growing of exotic fruits in England, including pineapple and lemon, in his heated greenhouses at Richmond." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthew_Decker> .

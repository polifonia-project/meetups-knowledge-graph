He is mainly noted for his elaborate fully custom guitar pedalboard systems. He has worked for Paul McCartney, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, The Who's Pete Townshend, Lou Reed, Tony Iommi, Brian May, Mark Knopfler (as well directing some Dire Straits videos), The Police's Andy Summers, and many others. Cornish has been described as \"the inventor of the pedalboard\" and a key figure in the transition from single effects to the development of multi-effects units." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pete_Cornish> .

Raised in Huntington, New York, Rice attended the Manhattan School of Music and began his professional career in the late 1980s during ska musicâ€™s so-called third wave as both a bassist and producer. In the late 1990s he became a composer and sound designer for television. In 2002, Rice moved to Brazil and although he continued working as a producer, performer and sound designer, he shifted his focus and became renowned as a mix engineer, working with a variety of local groups representing a number of different genres." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Rice> .

Constance's debut album English Rose was released on 22 March 2019. Reviewing, Pitchfork noted that \"Constance’s voice takes on scratchy, sonorous depth that brings to mind the subterranean soul of fellow London artists Nilüfer Yanya and King Krule.\" Clash noted that her songs have been described as 'indie-soul'. The BBC described her as a \"rising UK pop star\". In May 2019, she performed at The Great Escape Festival in Brighton." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connie_Constance> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Muldrow> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Ronald Muldrow (February 2, 1949 in Chicago – January 31, 2007 in Los Angeles) was a soul jazz and hard bop jazz guitarist. As an emerging jazz guitarist in the early 1970s, Muldrow connected with soul-jazz saxophonist Eddie Harris and contributed to many of his Atlantic albums from 1971 to 1976 and reunited with the saxophonist on Listen Here (1982). A teenage Muldrow heard jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery play \"Canadian Sunset\" on the radio and was captivated. His first big-time gig was with the Staple Singers, a gospel group. He also taught at various colleges and had published guitar-instruction books. Muldrow began forming bands in high school and earned a bachelor's in jazz studies from Roosevelt University in Illinois and a master's in studio and jazz guitar from the USC Thornton School of Music. Musician Georgia Anne Muldrow is his daughter." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ronald_Muldrow> .

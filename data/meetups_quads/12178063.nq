<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Pfleger> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Michael Louis Pfleger (born May 22, 1949) is an American Catholic priest and social activist located in Chicago. Since 1981, he has been pastor of St. Sabina Catholic Church, a Black parish in Chicago's Auburn Gresham neighborhood. He has been the subject of a number of controversies, mostly involving his public comments and activities related to his pro-Black stance on social issues. He was suspended on occasion for such incidents. Pfleger has also been the subject of multiple sex abuse allegations, including three in 2021. Those were found to be unsubstantiated by the Archdiocese of Chicago, but a fourth accuser later came forward. That investigation is ongoing as of October 2022." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Pfleger> .

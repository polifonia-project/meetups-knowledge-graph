He designed 14 bridges, notably Princes Bridge in Melbourne. As an architect, he designed half a dozen major public buildings, mainly in New Zealand, Perth, and Melbourne, notably the WA Supreme Court, while he was Principal Architect in the Architectural Division of the Public Works Department of Western Australia.

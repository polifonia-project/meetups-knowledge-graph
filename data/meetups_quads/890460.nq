<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Hooton> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Henry (Harry) Arthur Hooton (9 October 1908 – 27 June 1961) was an Australian poet and social commentator whose writing spanned the years 1930s–1961. He was described by a biographer as ahead of his time, or rather \"of his time while the majority of progressive artists and thinkers in Australia lagged far behind\". Initially a socialist and \"wobbly\", he later professed anarchism and became an associate of the Sydney Push during the 1940s, with connections to many other Australian writers, film makers and artists. Hooton's constant attitude and literary style was extravagant, provocative and explicitly outrageous." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harry_Hooton> .

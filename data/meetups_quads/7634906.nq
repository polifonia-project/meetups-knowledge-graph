He was involved with The Music Show, an exhibition of the Irish music industry held in the RDS in October 2008. He was Chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission (now the BCI) between 1993 and 1998. He has written several books, including Into the Heart: The Stories Behind Every U2 Song. He graduated from University College Dublin with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Whilst in college, Stokes was a member of a band called Eyeless, alongside Neil Jordan. He was also a freelance writer for outlets such as The Irish Times before founding Hot Press. He lives with his wife, Mairin Sheehy, in Dublin. On 20 June 2002, he appeared on an episode of Rattlebag which celebrated the 25th anniversary of Hot Press.

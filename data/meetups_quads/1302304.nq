He spent much of his career in North West England. In February 2015, and again in May 2017, he was found guilty of a string of indecent sexual assaults against teenage boys whilst he was employed as a teacher at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys before he moved into television presenting. He was sentenced to five years in prison following his initial convictions. He was sentenced to a further four years in June 2017 following conviction for further indecent assaults committed in Scotland. He was released on licence in December 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fred_Talbot> .

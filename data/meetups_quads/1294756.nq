<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Severinus_of_Noricum> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Severinus of Noricum (c. 410 â€“ 8 January 482) is a saint, known as the \"Apostle to Noricum\". It has been speculated that he was born in either Southern Italy or in the Roman province of Africa. Severinus himself refused to discuss his personal history before his appearance along the Danube in Noricum, after the death of Attila in 453. However, he did mention experiences with eastern desert monasticism, and his vita draws connections between Severinus and Saint Anthony of Egypt. Saint Severinus of Noricum is not to be confused with Severinus of Septempeda, the brother of Saint Victorinus of Camerino, and a bishop of Naples." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Severinus_of_Noricum> .

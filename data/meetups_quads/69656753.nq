<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bonnie_Linder> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lavonne Joan \"Bonnie\" Linder (March 15, 1927 – November 19, 2020) was a resident of Hartley, Iowa, who was the subject of a viral video in 2020. Her fame began after her daughter, Judy Zimmerman, posted a video of Linder waving to children on a school bus after they had arranged to stop in front of her house to wish her a happy birthday. The event occurred on March 13, two days before her 93rd birthday. Since the beginning of the school year, Linder had either waved from the window of her home, or, in favorable weather, stood on her porch every weekday morning to wave to the bus as it passed by, becoming known as \"Grandma on the Farm\". The bus driver would honk in response; as such, the driver wanted to do something to mark her birthday. Linder's routine of waving to the bus was substantially interrupted shortly afterwards as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in schools in the Hartley–Melvin–Sanborn Community School District closing, but she was able to greet the mail person and the driver of the cattle-feed delivery wagon, as she had been doing." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bonnie_Linder> .

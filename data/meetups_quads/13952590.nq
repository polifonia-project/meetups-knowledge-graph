<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Siu-kei> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lee Siu-kei (Chinese: 李兆基; 4 December 1949 – 2 June 2019) was a Hong Kong actor, scriptwriter and producer. He was a triad member and served as consultant for many Hong Kong triad movies. Lee left organized crime after being invited to act by director Ringo Lam in the 1980s. Lee along with Shing Fui-On, Ho Ka-kui, and Kwong Leung Wong were known as the \"top four villains of the Hong Kong film industry\" due to their prominence in the 1980s and 1990s. Lee was referred to as \"基哥\" or \"Brother Kei\". Lee suffered a stroke in early 2015 and affected his mobility. Since then, his involvement in the entertainment industry has declined. He admitted he had financial problems, as most of his life savings had been used for medical treatment." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Siu-kei> .

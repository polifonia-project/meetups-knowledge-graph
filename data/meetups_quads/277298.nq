<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Nunn> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Samuel Augustus Nunn Jr. (born September 8, 1938) is an American politician who served as a United States Senator from Georgia (1972â€“1997) as a member of the Democratic Party. After leaving Congress, Nunn co-founded the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a charitable organization working to prevent catastrophic attacks with nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, for which he is a co-chair. His political experience and credentials on national defense reportedly earned him consideration as a potential running mate for presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama after they became their party's nominees." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sam_Nunn> .

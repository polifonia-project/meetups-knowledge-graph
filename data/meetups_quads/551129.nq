<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muhammadu_Buhari> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Muhammadu Buhari GCFR (born 17 December 1942) is a Nigerian politician, who has served as the president of Nigeria since 2015. Buhari is a retired Nigerian Army major general who served as the country's military head of state from 31 December 1983 to 27 August 1985, after taking power in a military coup d'Ã©tat. The term Buharism is ascribed to the authoritarian policies of his military regime. Buhari ran for president of Nigeria in 2003, 2007, and 2011. In December 2014, he emerged as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress party for the 2015 general election. Buhari won the election, defeating incumbent President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. This was the first time in the history of Nigeria that an incumbent president lost a general election. He was sworn in on 29 May 2015. In February 2019, Buhari was re-elected, defeating his closest rival, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, by over 3 million votes." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muhammadu_Buhari> .

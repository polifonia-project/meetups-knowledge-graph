<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mariam_Dadiani> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Mariam Dadiani (Georgian: მარიამ დადიანი; born between 1599 and 1609; died 1682) was a daughter of Manuchar I Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, by his second wife, Tamar Jaqeli. Thrice married, successively to Simon I Gurieli, Prince of Guria, in 1621, King Rostom of Kartli in 1638, and the latter's adopted son and successor, King Vakhtang V in 1658. Mariam's dynastic marriages were part of complex political relations in the successor states of the former Kingdom of Georgia. Her first marriage was disrupted by her half-brother Levan II Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, in response to Simon Gurieli's patricidal coup. The second marriage, that with Rostom of Kartli, turned Mariam into an important figure in the contemporaneous Georgian politics. The wedding entourage was a thousands-strong army, which had to fight their way to Kartli against the forces of the principal opponent of the union, King George III of Imereti, an ally of Rostom's major foe, King Teimuraz I of Kakheti, Beyond being a factor of rapprochement between Mingrelia and Kartli, Mariam, a devout Christian, acted as a protector of Georgian Christianity in lieu of her Muslim and religiously tolerant husband and helped relax religious tension in the country. At her request, the couple's wedding ceremony was held in a Christian rite. The queen had several churches repaired and restored and the medieval Georgian chronicles copied and compiled. Mariam's only child, born of her first marriage to Prince Gurieli, died young. The childless Rostom, anxious to secure the dynastic survival of the Bagrationi family under the protection of the Safavid empire of Iran, adopted the prince of Mukhrani, also of Bagrationi descent, who succeeded on his death as Vakhtang V and married the queen dowager Mariam as her third husband. She outlived Vakhtang and died aged over 70. She was buried with royal honors at the Cathedral of the Living Pillar at Mtskheta." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mariam_Dadiani> .

By the time he retired, he held the NFL record for most career touchdowns by a tight end. Smith publicly announced he had AIDS in August 1986, being the first professional athlete to do so. He died two months later. A 2014 documentary from the NFL Network's A Football Life series profiles his career, as well as his \"double life as a closeted gay man and a star athlete.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerry_Smith_(tight_end)> .

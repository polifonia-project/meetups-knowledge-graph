<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johanna_Pigott> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Johanna Paton Pigott (born ca. 1955) is an Australian musician, singer-songwriter and screenwriter. Her best known hit songs are Dragon's \"Rain\" which peaked at No. 2 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart in 1983, and John Farnham's \"Age of Reason\". \"Rain\" was co-written with her partner, Dragon's Todd Hunter, and his younger brother, Marc Hunter. When \"Age of Reason\" reached the top of the charts in July 1988, Pigott became the first Australian woman to have written a No. 1 hit. It was co-written with Todd Hunter. Scripts by Pigott for TV include Sweet and Sour (created with Tim Gooding), Heartbreak High (for which she also co-wrote the theme music and other songs with Hunter) and Mortified (created by Angela Webber). Film scripts she has written include those for Broken English (co-written with Gregor Nicholas and James Salter) and Alex (featuring original music she co-wrote with Hunter, and for which she performed lead vocals on the soundtrack)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johanna_Pigott> .

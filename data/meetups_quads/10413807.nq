<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Carroll_(poet)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul Carroll (July 15, 1927 â€“ August 31, 1996) was an American poet and the founder of the Poetry Center of Chicago. A professor for many years at the University of Illinois at Chicago and professor emeritus, his books include Poem in Its Skin and Odes. While a student, he was an editor of Chicago Review. In 1985 he won the Chicago Poet's Award, and the city published his book \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\". His papers, The Paul Carroll Papers, are archived in the Special Collection Research Center at the University of Chicago Library. Among those papers are documents between Carroll's buddy, fellow poet and critic James Dickey, where Mr. Dickey states that Paul's late poetry was his best. One of these late poems, \"Song After Making Love\" was published in 2008 by Cold Mountain Review at Appalachian State University." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Carroll_(poet)> .

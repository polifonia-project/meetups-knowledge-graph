Allen is best known for his work with East of Eden, Snowy White, Bonnie Tyler, Mick Taylor and Van Morrison. He is not to be confused, although in many listings often is, with the similarly named former drummer with the British glam rock outfit, Hello, whose brother is Ultravox's Chris Cross." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeff_Allen_(musician)> .

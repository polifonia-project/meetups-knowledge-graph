<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bones_Howe> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dayton Burr \"Bones\" Howe (born March 18, 1933) is an American record producer and recording engineer who scored a string of hits in the 1960s and 1970s, often of the sunshine pop genre, starting in 1965 with The Turtles cover of Bob Dylan's \"It Ain't Me Babe,\" and continuing with most of the hits of the 5th Dimension and the Association. With the exception of Closing Time, he produced and engineered all of Tom Waits' releases with Asylum Records, some of which are considered among the artist's best recordings. Their almost decade-long collaboration has been described as \"one of the great artist-producer partnerships\". Howe performed music supervision on several feature films, and was one of the first industry members to serve as both producer and engineer of the hit records on which he worked. In addition, he was occasionally credited as a musician on recordings as \"Dayton Howe\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bones_Howe> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monica_Lewinsky> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Monica Samille Lewinsky (born July 23, 1973) is an American activist and writer. President Bill Clinton admitted to having an affair with Lewinsky while she worked at the White House as an intern in 1995 and 1996. The affair, and its repercussions (which included Clinton's impeachment), became known later as the Clintonâ€“Lewinsky scandal. As a result of the public coverage of the political scandal, Lewinsky gained international celebrity status. She subsequently engaged in a variety of ventures that included designing a line of handbags under her name, serving as an advertising spokesperson for a diet plan, and working as a television personality. Lewinsky later left the public spotlight to pursue a master's degree in psychology in London. In 2014, she returned to public view as a social activist speaking out against cyberbullying." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monica_Lewinsky> .

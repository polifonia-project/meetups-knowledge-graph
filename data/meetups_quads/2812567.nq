<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elvis_Duran> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Elvis Duran (born August 5, 1964) is an American radio personality. He is the host of the daily morning radio program Elvis Duran and the Morning Show in New York on Z100 and in syndication on Premiere Networks. Before his job at Z100, Duran's previous radio work included a stint as an on-air personality at WIOQ in Philadelphia. He served as WIOQ's program director from May 1989 until just before he was fired in February 1990. In October 1991, Duran became both the program director and morning show host of KBTS (now KGSR) in Austin, Texas. Prior to working at Z100, Duran also worked evenings at Z-93 with sidekick \"Hot Henrietta\" in Atlanta, and at Power 104 KRBE in Houston. He began his run at Z100 hosting the afternoon slot until April 1996, when Tom Poleman, the newly appointed program director (previously at KRBE Houston), moved Duran to the morning slot, where he has been ever since." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elvis_Duran> .

He is best known as an industrial music artist of the 1990s, noted for mixing metal and techno with more traditional industrial sounds. His extroverted onstage behaviour was unusual in the generally downbeat industrial genre. His most influential project was Cubanate, founded 1992 with Graham Rayner, Phil Barry and Steve Etheridge. Cubanate produced four studio albums. Their final album release, Interference, came out in 1998. They reformed in 2010, and released a re-mastered greatest hits album, Brutalism, in 2017. After performing several live dates again, they released the live album Live Brutalism in 2018, followed by the EP Kolossus in 2019 featuring new and remixed material." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marc_Heal> .

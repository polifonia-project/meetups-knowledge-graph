<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Haren> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Daniel John Haren (born September 17, 1980) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Haren played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Washington Nationals, Los Angeles Dodgers, Miami Marlins, and Chicago Cubs. He now serves as an executive with the Diamondbacks. Haren starred for the baseball teams at Bishop Amat High School and Pepperdine University before the Cardinals selected him in the second round of the 2001 MLB draft. After he made his MLB debut in 2003, the Cardinals traded him to the Athletics to get Mark Mulder. After his first All-Star season in 2007, the Athletics traded him to the Diamondbacks for prospects. After appearing in two more All-Star Games in 2008 and 2009, the Diamondbacks traded him to the Angels during the 2010 season for Joe Saunders and pitching prospects. A free agent after the 2012 season, he pitched for the Nationals in 2013, and then signed with the Dodgers for the 2014 season. The Dodgers traded Haren to Miami after the 2014 season. On July 31, 2015, Haren was traded to the Chicago Cubs for two minor league prospects. Haren is one of a small number of MLB pitchers to have beaten all 30 major-league teams. Although he was never a particularly well-known player, Haren finished his career with three All Star game appearances and the seventh best strikeout-to-walk ratio in major league history." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan_Haren> .

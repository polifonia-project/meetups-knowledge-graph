He also recorded a number of Godowsky’s Studies on Chopin's Études as well as other pieces. His students at the Curtis Institute of Music and later include Abbey Simon, Jorge Bolet, Shura Cherkassky, Sidney Foster, Julius Katchen, John Simms, Eleanor Sokoloff, Dorothy Wanderman, Seymour Lipkin, Alan Weiss, and Frances Ziffer. As a pianist he is regarded as a great dramatist, a sensitive poet, and superb colorist." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Saperton> .

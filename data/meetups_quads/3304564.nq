A defensive midfielder with tremendous physical strength and leadership skills as his main assets, he was widely regarded as the best footballer ever hailing from Cape Verde, and represented most notably Sporting CP, appearing in more than 400 official matches for the club over 11 seasons (two separate spells). Having earned more than 50 caps for Portugal, Oceano played with his adopted nation at Euro 1996." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oceano_Cruz> .

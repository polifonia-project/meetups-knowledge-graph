In addition to sideman work (prominently with Benny Goodman), Kirby is remembered for leading a successful chamber jazz sextet in the late 1930s and early 1940s, which scored several hit songs including \"Loch Lomond\" and the debut recording of \"Undecided\", a jazz standard. He is perhaps the first musician in the chamber jazz genre." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Kirby_(musician)> .

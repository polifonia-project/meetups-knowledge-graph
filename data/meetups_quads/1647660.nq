<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wren> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Wren (3 April 1871 â€“ 26 October 1953) was an Australian bookmaker, boxing and wrestling promoter, Irish nationalist, land speculator, newspaper owner, racecourse and racehorse owner, soldier, pro-conscriptionist and theatre owner. He became a legendary figure thanks mainly to a fictionalised account of his life in Frank Hardy's novel Power Without Glory, which was also made into a television series. After his death in 1953, Wren was buried at Boroondara Cemetery in Kew, Victoria." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wren> .

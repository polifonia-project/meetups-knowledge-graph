<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Lennon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alfred \"Alf\" Lennon (14 December 1912 â€“ 1 April 1976), also known as Freddie Lennon, was an Englishman best known as the father of musician John Lennon. Alfred spent many years in an orphanage with his sister, Edith, after his father died. Lennon married Julia Stanley in 1938. John was their only child, but as Alfred was frequently away at sea during World War II, he did not see much of his child during his infancy. During this period Julia became pregnant with another man's child. Alfred offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. Alf had very little contact with his son until Beatlemania, when they met again, but later the pair had only intermittent contact with each other. Alf died in Brighton, England, where he had gone to live after marrying Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Lennon> .

As a player, he had spells with Liverpool, Derby County, Southampton and Oxford United during the 1980s and 1990s. He made 45 appearances for the English national football team, and was a member of the team which reached the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup in 1990. At club level, the central defender won the 1992 FA Cup final as captain of Liverpool. Since retiring as a player in 1998, Wright has worked as a football manager, pundit, and businessman. He has had three stints as manager of Chester City, during the first of which he led the club back into the Football League as Football Conference champions after a four-year exile. He has also had spells managing Peterborough United, Oxford United and Southport. He is a regular pundit on LFC TV, Liverpool's official TV channel, and uses his experience as a foster carer and ambassador to advocate for more people to help children in need. Along with Michael Owen, another ex-Liverpool and England player, Wright is a founder of Red Sports, a Liverpool-based company that specialises in soccer school and coaching education programmes in China. Wright also founded Premier Legends, a company that gives fans around the world the chance to join ex-England and Premier League players for stadium tours, exhibition games, golf outings, dinners and audience Q+A sessions." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mark_Wright_(footballer,_born_1963)> .

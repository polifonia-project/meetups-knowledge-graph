<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Wolfson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir Isaac Wolfson, 1st Baronet FRS (/ˈwʊlfsən/; 17 September 1897 – 20 June 1991) was a Scottish businessman and philanthropist. He was managing director of Great Universal Stores (G.U.S. or Gussies) 1932–1947 and chairman 1947–1987. He established the Wolfson Foundation to distribute most of his fortune to good causes. Great Universal Stores was a mail order business. He joined the company as a merchandising controller in 1932, becoming joint managing director in the same year. The company was in trouble when he joined but he turned it round and made it into a very strong business and the principal source of his wealth. He also had other successful business ventures. He was succeeded by his son Leonard Wolfson." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Wolfson> .

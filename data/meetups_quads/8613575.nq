<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marty_Gold> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Martin Gold (December 26, 1915 â€“ January 14, 2011) was an American composer, pianist, and bandleader born in New York City, New York, United States. He was the pianist and arranger for the Korn Kobblers, a popular 1940s novelty group billed as \"America's most nonsensical dance band\", but was probably best known as the composer of the song \"Tell Me Why\", which was a hit for The Four Aces in 1951. Gold also arranged, conducted, and recorded for RCA Victor light orchestral \"mood music\" pieces utilising fully the possibilities of the newly developed Stereophonic sound, with whole sections of violins drifting between right and left speakers. He produced Peter Nero's first two albums for RCA and also conducted the accompanying orchestra. While at RCA, he had the distinction of playing on pre-Columbia signed Barbra Streisand's RCA audition demo in March, 1962. Gold died on January 14, 2011, in Agoura Hills, California, at the age of 95." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marty_Gold> .

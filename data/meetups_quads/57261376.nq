<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rizalina_Ilagan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rizalina \"Lina\" P. Ilagan (born June 19, 1954—disappeared on July 31, 1977) was an anti-martial law activist who belonged to a network of community organizations in the Southern Tagalog region in the Philippines. She was abducted by state security agents and disappeared on July 31, 1977, at the Makati Medical Center in Metro Manila, with nine other activists in what is believed to be the single biggest case of involuntary disappearance during Ferdinand Marcos’ martial law in the Philippines. The group, consisting of university students and professors working as community organizers in Southern Tagalog, later came to be known as the Southern Tagalog 10. Ilagan's name is inscribed on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani Wall of Remembrance, which honors martyrs and heroes of martial law. She is one of the heroes honored on the University of the Philippines Los Baños 'Hagdan ng Malayang Kamalayan' memorial." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rizalina_Ilagan> .

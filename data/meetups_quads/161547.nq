<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martha_Washington> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (June 2, 1731 â€” May 22, 1802) was the wife of George Washington, the first president of the United States. Although the title was not coined until after her death, Martha Washington served as the inaugural first lady of the United States. During her lifetime, she was often referred to as \"Lady Washington\". Martha Dandridge first married Daniel Parke Custis. They had four children, two of whom survived to young adulthood. Daniel's death made Martha a widow at age 26. She brought her vast wealth to her marriage to Washington, which enabled him to buy land to add to his personal estate. She also brought with her 84 dower slaves from Daniel Custis' estate for use during her lifetime. They and their descendants reverted to Custis' estate at her death and were inherited by his heirs. The Washingtons did not have children together, but they did rear her two surviving children, John and Martha. They also helped both of their extended families." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martha_Washington> .

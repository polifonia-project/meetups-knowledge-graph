Gibson is regarded as one of the greatest rugby union players; upon his induction into the IRB Hall of Fame in May 2011, former teammate and fellow Hall of Fame inductee Syd Millar said about Gibson that: ... [he] was one of the finest players of his generation, one of the finest players ever to represent Ireland and the British & Irish Lions and a man who epitomised the very ethos of the Game and its values." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mike_Gibson_(rugby_union)> .

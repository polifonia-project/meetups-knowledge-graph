<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerry_Anderson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Gerald Alexander Anderson MBE (né Abrahams; 14 April 1929 – 26 December 2012) was an English television and film producer, director, writer and occasional voice artist. He remains famous for his futuristic television programmes, especially his 1960s productions filmed with \"Supermarionation\" (marionette puppets containing electric moving parts). Anderson's first television production was the 1957 Roberta Leigh children's series The Adventures of Twizzle (1957–58). Torchy the Battery Boy (1960), Four Feather Falls (1960), Supercar (1961–62) and Fireball XL5 (1962–63) followed later, both series breaking into the U.S. television market in the early 1960s. In the mid-1960s Anderson produced his most successful series, Thunderbirds. Other television productions of the 1960s include Stingray, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and Joe 90. Anderson also wrote and produced several feature films. Following a shift towards live-action productions in the 1970s, he had a long and successful association with media impresario Lew Grade and Grade's company ITC, continuing until the second series of Space: 1999. After a career lull when a number of new series concepts failed to get off the ground, his career began a new phase in the early 1980s when audience nostalgia for his earlier Supermarionation series (prompted by Saturday morning re-runs in Britain and Australia) led to new Anderson productions being commissioned. Later projects include a 2005 CG remake of Captain Scarlet entitled Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gerry_Anderson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Lashley> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Franklin Roberto Lashley (born July 16, 1976) is an American professional wrestler and mixed martial artist. He is currently signed with WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Bobby Lashley. He is an eight-time world champion, having been a two-time WWE Champion, two-time ECW World Champion, and four-time TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Lashley is also known for his mixed martial arts (MMA) career in Bellator MMA and Strikeforce. Lashley debuted in WWE in 2005, appearing on the SmackDown brand where he became a one-time United States Champion. After being drafted to the ECW brand the following year, Lashley became a two-time ECW World Champion, the first African-American to hold the championship. During this time, he had a high-profile rivalry with company chairman Vince McMahon, which included representing Donald Trump in the \"Battle of the Billionaires\" at WrestleMania 23, before leaving the company in 2008. He subsequently pursued a career in MMA and had his first professional fight in December 2008. After amassing a career record of 10â€“2, he signed with Bellator MMA in 2014 where he won all five of his career bouts from 2014 to 2016. In 2009, Lashley began appearing in professional wrestling promotion TNA (later renamed to Impact), where he became a four-time TNA/Impact World Heavyweight Champion and the first African-American to hold that championship. He was also a one-time X Division Champion and the final King of the Mountain Champion. After returning to WWE in 2018, he was assigned to the Raw brand, becoming a two-time Intercontinental Champion and winning a second and third United States Championship. He ultimately won the WWE Championship twice, becoming the third African-American to hold the WWE Championship (after The Rock and Kofi Kingston). He has headlined multiple pay-per-view (PPV) events for WWE and TNA/Impact, including the 2016 edition of the latter's flagship event, Bound for Glory. He is also one of the two wrestlers to have won the WWE, ECW, and TNA/Impact world championships, the other being Rob Van Dam. Lashley is the only wrestler to have multiple reigns with the aforementioned championships." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bobby_Lashley> .

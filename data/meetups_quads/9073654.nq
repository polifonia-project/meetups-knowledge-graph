He was more comfortable as a centre-back, but could also play as a full-back. He scored eight goals in 470 league and cup appearances over the course of a 14-year professional career in the English Football League and National League. He graduated through the Wolverhampton Wanderers Academy to turn professional in February 2007. He spent much of the 2007–08 season on loan at Hereford United, helping the club to win promotion into League One. He joined Port Vale on loan at the start of the 2008–09 season, and his loan stay was made permanent in January 2009. He played 53 games for the club in 2009–10, and continued to be a key member of the defence in 2010–11. He joined Championship club Barnsley on loan in March 2012, with a view to a permanent deal in the summer. From Barnsley, he was loaned out to Shrewsbury Town in September 2012. He moved back into League Two with Northampton Town in February 2013, and spent over two years with the club before moving on to Mansfield Town; he captained both Northampton and Mansfield. He signed with Forest Green Rovers in May 2017 and stayed with the club for two seasons before joining non-League Yeovil Town in June 2019. He served Yeovil as club captain until his death, at the age of 32, in March 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Collins_(footballer,_born_1988)> .

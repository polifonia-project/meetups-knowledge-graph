Fromm is the international director of the white supremacist organization Council of Conservative Citizens and is the director of several far-right groups in Canada, most notably the Canadian Association for Free Expression, Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform and the Canada First Immigration Reform Committee. He has hosted a radio show on the Stormfront web site and has ties to former Ku Klux Klan members David Duke, Don Black, and Mark Martin, a white supremacist rally organizer in Covington, Ohio. The National Post newspaper described him as \"one of Canada's most notorious white supremacists\". Since 2018, he has been based in Hamilton, Ontario, but he previously lived in Mississauga, Ontario, outside of Toronto, since the 1970s." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Fromm_(white_supremacist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Cox> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dean Michael Cox (born 1 August 1981) is a former Australian rules footballer and current assistant coach of the Sydney Swans who played for the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League (AFL). Originally from Dampier, Western Australia, he debuted with East Perth in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) in 2000. After winning the Simpson Medal as the best player in the grand final in his first season, Cox was recruited to West Coast with the 28th pick in the 2000 Rookie Draft. He made his senior debut during the 2001 season, and played in West Coast's 2006 premiership side. A ruckman, Cox was named in the All-Australian team six times, including four seasons consecutively from 2005 to 2008, and was considered the outstanding player in his position throughout much of his career. He won West Coast's best and fairest award in 2008, and finished in the top three on four other occasions. Cox retired at the end of the 2014 season, finishing his career with 290 games, a club record, and 169 goals." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dean_Cox> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walker_Percy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Walker Percy, Obl.S.B. (May 28, 1916 â€“ May 10, 1990) was an American writer whose interests included philosophy and semiotics. Percy is noted for his philosophical novels set in and around New Orleans; his first, The Moviegoer, won the National Book Award for Fiction. Trained as a physician at Columbia University, Percy decided to become a writer after a bout of tuberculosis. He devoted his literary life to the exploration of \"the dislocation of man in the modern age.\" His work displays a combination of existential questioning, Southern sensibility, and deep Catholic faith. He had a lifelong friendship with author and historian Shelby Foote and spent much of his life in Covington, Louisiana, where he died of prostate cancer in 1990." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walker_Percy> .

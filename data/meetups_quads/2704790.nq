<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stuart_Heisler> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stuart Heisler (December 5, 1896 – August 21, 1979) was an American film and television director. He was a son of Luther Albert Heisler (1855–1916), a carpenter, and Frances Baldwin Heisler (1857–1935). He worked as a motion picture editor from 1921 to 1936, then worked as film director for the rest of his career. Heisler directed the 1944 propaganda film The Negro Soldier, a documentary-style recruitment piece aimed at getting African-Americans to enlist in the U.S. military during World War II. He found commercial and critical success in the late forties directing Susan Hayward in two of her breakthrough performances. He received an Oscar nomination in 1949 for his contribution to the visual effects of the film Tulsa." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stuart_Heisler> .

In 1940, aged 13, Simpson became the youngest female musician ever in the Sydney Symphony Orchestra (SSO). At the age of 17 Simpson left the SSO to play with the Colgate-Palmolive Orchestra but rejoined the SSO in 1953 where she remained for more than 30 years, leading the cello section for much of that time.

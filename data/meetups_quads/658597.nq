<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rudaki> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rudaki (also spelled Rodaki; Persian: رودکی; 858 – 940/41) was a Persian poet, singer and musician, who served as a court poet under the Samanids. He is regarded as the first major poet to write in New Persian. Said to have composed more than 180,000 verses, only a small portion of his work has survived, most notably a small part of his versification of the Kalila wa-Dimna, a collection of Indian fables. Born in the village of Panjrudak (then a suburb of Samarqand), the most important part of Rudaki's career was spent at the court of the Samanids. While biographical information connects him to the Samanid amir (ruler) Nasr II (r. 914–943), he may have already joined the court under the latters predecessor, Ahmad Samani (r. 907–914). Rudaki's success was largely due to the support of his primary patron, the vizier Abu'l-Fadl al-Bal'ami (died 940), who played an important role in the blooming of New Persian literature in the 10th-century. Following the downfall of Bal'ami in 937, Rudaki's career deteriorated, eventually being dismissed from the court. He thereafter lived his last years in poverty, dying blind and alone in his hometown. In Iran, Rudaki is acknowledged as the \"founder of New Persian poetry\" and in Tajikistan as the \"father of Tajik literature\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rudaki> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jayda_Fransen> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jayda Kaleigh Fransen is a British far-right activist and politician who was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment in 2018. Formerly involved with the English Defence League (EDL), she left due to its association with drink-fuelled violence. She then joined the far-right fascist political organisation Britain First. With Paul Golding as leader, Fransen was deputy leader from 2014 to 2019. She became acting leader for six months from December 2016 to June 2017, while Golding was imprisoned in December 2016. Fransen was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2014 Rochester and Strood by-election, the 2016 London Assembly election, the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the 2021 Batley and Spen by-election, the 2022 Southend West by-election, and the 2022 Wakefield by-election. In addition to online anti-Islamic activism, she has marched while holding a white cross, in what she called \"Christian patrols\", through predominantly Muslim populated areas of Britain. In March 2018, she was sentenced to 36 weeks' imprisonment after being convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jayda_Fransen> .

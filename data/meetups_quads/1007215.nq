<http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_Clancy> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Francis Michael \"King\" Clancy (February 25, 1902 â€“ November 8, 1986) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player, referee, coach and executive. Clancy played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs. He was a member of three Stanley Cup championship teams and won All-Star honours. After he retired in 1937, he remained in hockey, becoming a coach for the Montreal Maroons. Clancy next worked as a referee for the NHL. He joined the Maple Leafs organization and worked in the organization as a coach and team executive until his death in 1986. In 2017 Clancy was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. Clancy's nickname \"King\" originates from his father Tom, who was the first 'King Clancy' and played football with the Ottawa Rough Riders. At the time the football was not snapped as is done today, but was 'heeled' back from the line. Frank's father was very good at this and was named 'King of the Heelers' or 'King' for short. This nickname was eventually transferred to Frank." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/King_Clancy> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uesugi_Kenshin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Nagao Kagetora (長尾 景虎, February 18, 1530 – April 19, 1578), later known as Uesugi Kenshin (上杉 謙信) was Japanese daimyō. He was born in Nagao clan, and after adoption into the Uesugi clan, ruled Echigo Province in the Sengoku period of Japan. He was one of the most powerful daimyō of the Sengoku period. Known as the \"Dragon of Echigo\", while chiefly remembered for his prowess on the battlefield as a military genius, Kenshin is also regarded as an extremely skillful administrator who fostered the growth of local industries and trade and his rule saw a marked rise in the standard of living of Echigo. Kenshin is famed for his honourable conduct, his military expertise, a long-standing rivalry with Takeda Shingen, his numerous defensive campaigns to restore order in the Kantō region as the Kanto Kanrei, and his belief in the Buddhist god of war—Bishamonten. Many of his followers and others believed him to be the Avatar of Bishamonten, and called Kenshin the \"God of War\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uesugi_Kenshin> .

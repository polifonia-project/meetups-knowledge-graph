For 14 years she was a foreign correspondent and she has written from nearly 40 countries. With her husband, Washington Post journalist Kevin Sullivan, Jordan ran the newspaper's bureaus in Tokyo, Mexico City and London. Jordan also was the founding editor and head of content for Washington Post Live, which organizes political debates, conferences and news events for the media company. Jordan frequently appears on TV. She wrote the bestselling 2020 book, “The Art of Her Deal,” the unauthorized biography of Melania Trump.

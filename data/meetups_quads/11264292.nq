<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Ellison> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Walter Ellison (April 18, 1964 – June 20, 1996) was the frontman for the band Material Issue. He tirelessly promoted his band, booked tours, and secured a major-label deal in 1990. Ellison — along with bassist Ted Ansani and drummer — would lead the renaissance of power pop in the early 1990s. He committed suicide on June 20, 1996, by carbon monoxide poisoning. The song \"Escape Is at Hand for the Travelin' Man\" by The Tragically Hip was written about lead singer Gord Downie's relationship with Ellison and his grief over the suicide. Ellison grew up in Illinois and attended Glenbard North High School." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Ellison> .

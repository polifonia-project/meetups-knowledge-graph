<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ike_Zimmerman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Isaiah \"Ike\" Zimmerman (April 27, 1907 â€“ August 3, 1967) was an American blues guitarist, who is now known to have been musician Robert Johnson's main guitar teacher. Zimmerman (sometimes spelled Zinnerman) was born in Grady, Alabama. He married Ruth Sellers in the late 1920s, and lived with her and their children near Beauregard, Mississippi. He played guitar and harmonica in local juke joints, often practising at night in local cemeteries where he would not disturb others. He became known for his guitar skills, and gave guitar lessons. Robert Johnson, who had been born in nearby Hazlehurst, came back to the area, probably around 1931, and sought out Zimmerman with the intention of improving his fingerpicking and bottleneck guitar skills." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ike_Zimmerman> .

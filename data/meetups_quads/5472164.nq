Casey was one of the original members, starting the band in 1996 with guitarist Rick Barton and singer Mike McColgan. He is the only original member of the Dropkick Murphys left in the band, though drummer Matt Kelly joined shortly after formation in 1997. He is known for his melodic vocal parts and solid punk rock bass playing. Dropkick Murphys released their tenth album Turn Up That Dial on April 30, 2021. Casey also founded the charity group The Claddagh Fund, owns two Boston restaurants, McGreevy's (which closed in August 2020) and Yellow Door Taqueria, and runs his own boxing promotion called Murphys Boxing. Casey has a small role in the 2016 film Patriots Day, about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the subsequent terrorist manhunt." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ken_Casey> .

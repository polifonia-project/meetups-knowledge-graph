<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elisabeth_of_Wied> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Pauline Elisabeth Ottilie Luise of Wied (29 December 1843 â€“ 2 March 1916) was the first queen of Romania as the wife of King Carol I from 15 March 1881 to 27 September 1914. She had been the princess consort of Romania since her marriage to then-Prince Carol on 15 November 1869. Elisabeth was born into a German noble family. She was briefly considered as a potential bride for the future British king Edward VII, but Edward rejected her. Elisabeth married Prince Carol of Romania in 1869. Their only child, Princess Maria, died aged three in 1874, and Elisabeth never fully recovered from the loss of her daughter. When Romania became a kingdom in 1881, Elisabeth became queen, and she was crowned together with Carol that same year. Elisabeth was a prolific writer under the name Carmen Sylva." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elisabeth_of_Wied> .

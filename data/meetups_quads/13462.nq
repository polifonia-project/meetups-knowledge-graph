<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harlan_Ellison> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Harlan Jay Ellison (May 27, 1934 â€“ June 28, 2018) was an American writer, known for his prolific and influential work in New Wave speculative fiction and for his outspoken, combative personality. Robert Bloch, the author of Psycho, described Ellison as \"the only living organism I know whose natural habitat is hot water.\" His published works include more than 1,700 short stories, novellas, screenplays, comic book scripts, teleplays, essays, and a wide range of criticism covering literature, film, television, and print media. Some of his best-known works include the 1967 Star Trek episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" (he subsequently wrote a book about the experience that includes his original screenplay), his A Boy and His Dog cycle, and his short stories \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\" and \"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman\". He was also editor and anthologist for Dangerous Visions (1967) and Again, Dangerous Visions (1972). Ellison won numerous awards, including multiple Hugos, Nebulas, and Edgars." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harlan_Ellison> .

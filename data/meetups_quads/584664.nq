<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Krasner> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Lenore \"Lee\" Krasner (born Lena Krassner; October 27, 1908 â€“ June 19, 1984) was an American abstract expressionist painter, with a strong speciality in collage. She was married to Jackson Pollock. Although there was much cross-pollination between their two styles, the relationship somewhat overshadowed her contribution for some time. Krasner's training, influenced by George Bridgman and Hans Hofmann, was the more formalized, especially in the depiction of human anatomy, and this enriched Pollock's more intuitive and unstructured output. Krasner is now seen as a key transitional figure within abstraction, who connected early-20th-century art with the new ideas of postwar America, and her work fetches high prices at auction. She is also one of the few female artists to have had a retrospective show at the Museum of Modern Art." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lee_Krasner> .

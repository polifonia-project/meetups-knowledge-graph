<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Dukes> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Adam King Feeney (born September 12, 1983), better known as Ging and by his former stage name Frank Dukes, is a Canadian musician, record producer, and songwriter. A prolific producer, he has worked with artists including Camila Cabello (\"Havana\"), Post Malone (\"Congratulations,\" \"Better Now,\" Circles\") and The Weeknd (\"Call Out My Name\"). Following a two decade production career, he retired as Frank Dukes in 2021 to pursue his own music and art as Ging; he released his debut solo album We're Here, My Dear in 2022. In his early career, Feeney established himself as a producer by working with a number of members of Wu-Tang Clan and G-Unit as well as young Toronto talent like BADBADNOTGOOD. He came to prominence in the 2010s as a composer and beatmaker whose work was utilized by prominent record producers to sample in their own productions; many of his samples have been used in songs for major artists including Drake (with Feeneys' major placement, \"0 to 100\"), Travis Scott, Taylor Swift, and Kanye West, with some drawing from the Kingsway Music Library, a popular sample library which he has run since 2011. Feeney has helped produce over thirty platinum singles since 2014. Among other awards and nominations, Feeneys' work has won three Grammy Awards from 32 nominations. He is considered one of Canada's top producers having been awarded Songwriter of the Year by SOCAN four times and has received similar honors from BMI, the Juno Awards, Variety, and Jaxsta." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Dukes> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Kerensky> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky (4 May [O.S. 22 April] 1881 â€“ 11 June 1970) was a Russian lawyer and revolutionary who led the Russian Provisional Government and the short-lived Russian Republic for three months from late July to early November 1917. After the February Revolution of 1917, he joined the newly formed provisional government, first as Minister of Justice, then as Minister of War, and after July as the government's second Minister-Chairman. He was the leader of the social-democratic Trudovik faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Kerensky was also a vice-chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, a position that held a sizable amount of power. Kerensky became the prime minister of the Provisional Government, and his tenure was consumed with World War I. Despite mass opposition to the war, Kerensky chose to continue Russia's participation. His government cracked down on anti-war sentiment and dissent in 1917, which made his administration even more unpopular. Kerensky remained in power until the October Revolution. This revolution saw the Bolsheviks replace his government with a Marxist one, led by Vladimir Lenin. Kerensky escaped Russia and lived the remainder of his life in exile. He divided his time between Paris and New York City. Kerensky worked for the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Kerensky> .

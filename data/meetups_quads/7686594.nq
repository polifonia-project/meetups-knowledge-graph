<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_George_Trevelyan,_4th_Baronet> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sir George Lowthian Trevelyan, 4th Baronet (5 November 1906 â€“ 9 February 1996) was a British educational pioneer and a founding father of the New Age movement. In 1942, after listening to a lecture by Dr Walter Stein, a student of Rudolf Steiner, he transitioned from being agnostic to a new age spiritual thinker, and even studied anthroposophy in the coming years. He first became a History teacher at Gordonstoun School, pioneering radical education methods. After World War II, in 1948, he became the Warden at Attingham Park, a pioneering adult education college in Shropshire, from where he retired in 1971 to found the Wrekin Trust, an educational charity. He was subsequently associated with the Soil Association, the Findhorn Foundation, the Teilhard de Chardin Society and the Essene Network. In the last 15 years of his life he was the focus of many lecture tours and meetings. He also wrote numerous books, including A Vision of the Aquarian Age (1977), Operation Redemption (1981), Summons to a High Crusade (1985) and finally Exploration into God (1991). He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1982 for \"educating the adult spirit to a new non-materialistic vision of human nature.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_George_Trevelyan,_4th_Baronet> .

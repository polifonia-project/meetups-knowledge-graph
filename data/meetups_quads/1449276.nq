<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Bardac> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Emma Bardac (née Moyse; 10 July 1862 – 20 August 1934) was a French singer and the mutual love interest of both Gabriel Fauré and Claude Debussy. Of Jewish descent, Emma married, aged 17, Parisian banker Sigismond Bardac, by whom she had two children: Raoul, and Régina-Hélène (later (1892–1985)). Emma was an accomplished singer and brilliant conversationalist. Fauré wrote his Dolly Suite in the 1890s for Regina-Hélène and La bonne chanson for Emma herself. After her affair with Fauré, Emma was introduced to Debussy in late 1903 by her son Raoul, one of his students. In the summer of 1904, after a secret vacation with Emma in Jersey, Debussy wrote to his wife Rosalie (\"Lilly\") Texier announcing the end of their marriage. Distraught, Texier attempted suicide with a revolver in the Place de la Concorde. The ensuing scandal alienated Bardac and Debussy from friends and family, and in the spring of 1905 they fled to England, where they finalized their divorces, Emma from Sigismond on 4 May, Debussy from Rosalie on 2 August. They returned to Paris in time for the birth, on 30 October, of their daughter Claude-Emma, nicknamed \"Chouchou\", and dedicatee of his Children's Corner Suite composed in 1909. The couple bought a large house in a courtyard development off the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now Avenue Foch), where Debussy would reside for the rest of his life. Bardac eventually married Debussy in 1908, their troubled union enduring until Debussy's death 10 years later. Claude-Emma died while recovering from diphtheria in 1919 when the doctor gave her the wrong treatment, the year after her father's death. Emma Bardac died in 1934 and, like Claude-Emma, was laid to rest in Debussy's grave in the Cimetière de Passy in Paris." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Bardac> .

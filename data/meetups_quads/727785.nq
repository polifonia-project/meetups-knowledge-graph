<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fulbert_Youlou> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Abbé Fulbert Youlou (29 June, 17 June or 19 July 1917 – 6 May 1972) was a laicized Brazzaville-Congolese Roman Catholic priest, nationalist leader and politician, who became the first President of the Republic of the Congo on its independence. In August 1960, he led his country into independence. In December 1960 he organised an intercontinental conference in Brazzaville, in the course of which he praised the advantages of economic liberalism and condemned communism. Three years later, he left power. Youlou disappointed many from the North when he imposed a single party system and imprisoned union leaders in August 1963; this led to the revolution of the \"Trois Glorieuses.\" Charles de Gaulle despised him and France refused to assist him. He resigned in the face of overwhelming opposition to his governance." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fulbert_Youlou> .

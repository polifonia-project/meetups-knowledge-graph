<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alonzo_Cushing> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Alonzo Hereford Cushing (January 19, 1841 â€“ July 3, 1863) was an artillery officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was killed in action during the Battle of Gettysburg while defending the Union position on Cemetery Ridge against Pickett's Charge. In 2013, 150 years after Cushing's death, he was nominated for the Medal of Honor. The nomination was approved by the United States Congress, and was sent for review by the Defense Department and the President. On August 26, 2014, the White House announced he would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, with President Obama presiding over the official ceremony on November 6, 2014. Helen Bird Loring Ensign, a first cousin once removed, accepted the medal on Cushing's behalf, as Cushing left no direct descendants." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alonzo_Cushing> .

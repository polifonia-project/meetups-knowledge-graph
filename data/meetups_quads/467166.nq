<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dyer> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Dyer (1699 â€“ 15 December 1757) was a painter and Welsh poet who became a priest in the Church of England. He was most recognised for Grongar Hill, one of six early poems featured in a 1726 miscellany. Longer works published later include the less successful genre poems, The Ruins of Rome (1740) and The Fleece (1757). His work has always been more anthologised than published in separate editions, but his talent was later recognised by William Wordsworth among others." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dyer> .

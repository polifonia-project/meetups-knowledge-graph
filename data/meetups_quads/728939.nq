<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Frohman> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Charles Frohman (July 15, 1856 â€“ May 7, 1915) was an American theater manager and producer, who discovered and promoted many stars of the American stage. Notably, he produced Peter Pan, both in London and the US, the latter production starring Maude Adams who would be strongly identified with the part. In 1896, Frohman co-founded the Theatrical Syndicate, a nationwide chain of theaters that dominated the American touring company business, until the Shubert brothers grew strong enough to end its virtual monopoly. He partnered with English producers, including Seymour Hicks, with whom he produced a string of London hits prior to 1910, such as Quality Street, The Admirable Crichton, The Catch of the Season, The Beauty of Bath, and A Waltz Dream. Frohman produced over 700 shows. At the height of his fame, Frohman died in the 1915 sinking of the RMS Lusitania." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Frohman> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Morgan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dennis Morgan (born Earl Stanley Morner, December 20, 1908 â€“ September 7, 1994) was an American actor-singer. He used the acting pseudonym Richard Stanley before adopting the name under which he gained his greatest fame. According to one obituary, he was \"a twinkly-eyed handsome charmer with a shy smile and a pleasant tenor voice in carefree and inconsequential Warner Bros musicals of the forties, accompanied by Jack Carson.\" Another said, \"for all his undoubted star potential, Morgan was perhaps cast once too often as the likeable, clean-cut, easy-going but essentially uncharismatic young man who typically loses his girl to someone more sexually magnetic.\" David Shipman said he \"was comfortable, good-looking, well-mannered: the antithesis of the gritty Bogart.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dennis_Morgan> .

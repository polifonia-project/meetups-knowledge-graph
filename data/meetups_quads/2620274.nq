<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeffrey_Toobin> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeffrey Ross Toobin (/ˈtuːbɪn/; born May 21, 1960) is an American lawyer, author, blogger, and longtime legal analyst for CNN. He left CNN on September 4, 2022. During the Iran–Contra affair, Toobin served as an associate counsel on this investigation in the Department of Justice. He moved from government and the practice of law into full-time writing during the 1990s, when he published his first books. He wrote for The New Yorker from 1993 to 2020. He was fired that fall for masturbating on-camera during a ZOOM video conference call with co-workers. He continued to serve as legal analyst for CNN for two years. Toobin has written several books, including accounts of the 1970s Patty Hearst kidnapping and time with the SLA, the O. J. Simpson murder case, and the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. Each of the latter two were adapted for television as seasons of FX's American Crime Story, with the Simpson case premiering in 2016." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeffrey_Toobin> .

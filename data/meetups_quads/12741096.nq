<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Ferris_(Scottish_writer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Paul John Ferris (born 10 November 1963) is a Scottish author and organised crime figure. Ferris was an enforcer for Glasgow 'Godfather' Arthur Thompson in the early 1980s. Known for his ruthlessness and extreme violence, he rose to a prominent position in the city's criminal underworld. He served a prison sentence for weapons possession in 1984 and believed he had been betrayed by the Thompsons. In 1991 Thompson's son, Arthur Jr, was shot dead. Ferris was charged with his murder and subsequently found not guilty after what was the longest criminal trial in Scottish history at that time. He was imprisoned again from 1998 to 2002 for trading in firearms and possessing explosives. Ferris was also involved in a long-running feud with Tam McGraw. His first book was published in 2001 while he was in prison. Since his release he has written three more books about crime, and has been involved in the security industry." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Ferris_(Scottish_writer)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Swan> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Sneddon Swan (born December 25, 1941 â€“ February 14, 2017 in East Lothian, Scotland.) was a chemist, biologist, author, and expert on single malt whisky. Referred to as the \"Einstein of Whisky\", his research into whisky and its distillation process pioneered new methods of production. Swan demonstrated that it was possible to create good whisky despite being aged a short amount of time, leading him to work alongside new whisky distilleries throughout the world as a consultant and expert. Following his scientific and technical contributions to the industry, the \"Dr Jim Swan Award For Services To Scotch Whisky\" award was posthumously named after him." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Swan> .

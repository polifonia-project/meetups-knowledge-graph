<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan-Alexandru_Voiculescu> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dan Voiculescu (born 20 July 1940 in Saschiz, died 29 August 2009, in Bucharest) was a Romanian composer, doctor of musicology (1983), professor of counterpoint and composition at the Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca (since 1963) and the National Music University of Bucharest (since 2000), and a member of the Union of Romanian Composers and Musicologists (since 1965). His musicological studies fill a niche in the Romanian bibliography; they are significant contributions towards understanding the polyphony of 20th-century classical music. His compositions are performed frequently, both in Romania and abroad." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dan-Alexandru_Voiculescu> .

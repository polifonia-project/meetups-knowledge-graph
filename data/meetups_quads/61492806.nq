<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sha'Carri_Richardson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Sha'Carri Richardson (/ʃəˈkɛri/ shə-KERR-ee; born March 25, 2000) is an American track and field sprinter who competes in the 100 meters and 200 meters. Richardson rose to fame in 2019 as a freshman at Louisiana State University, running 10.75 seconds to break the 100 m record at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships. This winning time made her one of the ten fastest women in history at 19 years old. In April 2021, Richardson ran a new personal best of 10.72 seconds, becoming the tied seventh-fastest woman of all time and the fourth-fastest American woman in history. She qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics after winning the women's 100-meter dash with 10.86 in the United States Olympic Trials. On July 1, it was reported that Richardson had tested positive for cannabis use following her 100 m final at the U.S. Trials, invalidating her win and making her ineligible to compete in the 100 m at the Olympics. After successfully completing a counseling program, she accepted a one-month period of ineligibility that began on June 28, 2021." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sha'Carri_Richardson> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Srividya> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Srividya (24 July 1953 â€“ 19 October 2006), also known as Sreevidya, was an Indian actress best known for her work predominantly in Malayalam and Tamil films, along with few Telugu, Kannada and Hindi films. In a career spanning for 40 years, she had acted in more than 800 films. In the latter part of her career, she concentrated on Malayalam films. In addition to acting, Srividya occasionally worked as a playback singer as well as carnatic singer. She was also a well trained Bharathanatyam dancer. She was best known for restraint and subtlety in portrayal of varied emotions. She used her own voice for dubbing almost in all movies in all languages. In 2006, she died of Spine cancer, aged 53." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Srividya> .

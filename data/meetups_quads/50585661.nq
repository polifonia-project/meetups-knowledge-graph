<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Natalia_Leite> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Natalia Leite (born October 15, 1984) is a Brazilian writer and director. She is best known for directing the indie hit film M.F.A., a feminist rape-revenge thriller that spurred debates at the start of the #MeToo movement. The film premiered at SXSW in 2017 where it was nominated for a Grand Jury Award and subsequently written about in The New York Times, CNN, and other outlets. Her feature film debut Bare premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2015 and was released in US theaters by IFC and by Paramount Pictures. Leite is also a frequent contributor to Vice Media and is known to incorporate her documentary subjects into her scripted films. Her work has been described as having “a bracing, assertive style” (Variety) and as “cementing the reign over highly stylized, sexually progressive dramas” (Slant)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Natalia_Leite> .

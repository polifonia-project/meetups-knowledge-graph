He has won a Filmfare Award and three SIIMA Awards. The son of veteran film editor A. Mohan, Ravi made his debut as a Child artist in the Telugu film Bava Bavamaridi (1993), produced by his father. The success of a later film Jayam prompted the title to become a prefix to his stage name, and he continued to collaborate with his brother for other films including M. Kumaran S/O Mahalakshmi (2004), Unakkum Enakkum (2006), Santhosh Subramaniam (2008), Thillalangadi (2010) and Thani Oruvan (2015)." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jayam_Ravi> .

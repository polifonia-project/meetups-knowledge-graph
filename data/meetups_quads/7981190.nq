<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_Forrester> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Joel Forrester (born May 2, 1946) is an American jazz composer and pianist. He composed the theme song to NPR's Fresh Air, performed by The Microscopic Septet which Forrester founded in 1980 and led with saxophonist Phillip Johnston. A documentary film about Joel Forrester was made in 2014 entitled Embracing Dissonance: A Life in Bebop. The one-hour and five-minute documentary is an exploration of his diverse musical talents and influences. Forrester recounts previously unknown aspects of the life of Thelonious Monk and the Jazz Baroness, Pannonica Rothschild. The film also explores bebop's origins in the Harlem jazz club Minton's, Forrester's work as a composer of African American church music, as an improv accompanist for silent movies, and as a teacher of jazz musical forms. Forrester's story plays out like a jazz tune: a strong theme runs through a series of improvisational changes, solo riffs, and ensemble resolutions to weave the fabric of a bebop life." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joel_Forrester> .

He was primarily a fullback but also starred on the offensive line. A graduate of University of Tennessee, Reese joined the Chicago Bears for their 1946 championship season, playing 3 games and rushing 18 times for 84 yards. In 1948, he joined the Montreal Alouettes where his 251-pound frame made him the biggest fullback in Canadian pro football. Playing a full 12 game season he was selected as an All-Star at guard. In 1949, he played another full sked, helping the Larks to their first ever Grey Cup championship. Reese died on October 28, 1981 in Dover, Ohio." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lloyd_Reese> .

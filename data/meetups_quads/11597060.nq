<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Marks> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard Marks (November 10, 1943 – December 31, 2018) was an American film editor with more than 30 editing credits for feature and television films dating from 1972. In an extended, notable collaboration (1983–2010), he edited all of director James L. Brooks' feature films. Marks was Barry Malkin's assistant editor on The Rain People (1969), which was directed by Francis Ford Coppola early in his career. He then assisted Dede Allen on Alice's Restaurant (1969) and on Little Big Man (1970); he co-edited Serpico (1973) with Allen. Dede Allen was among the most prominent film editors of her generation, and she was known for helping to develop the careers of several younger editors. Roger Crittenden has written that \"Perhaps the outstanding graduate of the Dede Allen Academy is Richard Marks.\" Marks was nominated for many awards including four Academy Awards (Oscars), three ACE Eddie Awards, three BAFTA Awards, and an Emmy. Marks was elected to membership in the American Cinema Editors, and in 2013 he received their Career Achievement Award. Apolcalypse Now was listed as the third best-edited film of all time in a 2012 survey of members of the Motion Picture Editors Guild." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Marks> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judy_Chicago> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen; July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. During the 1970s, Chicago founded the first feminist art program in the United States at California State University Fresno (formerly Fresno State College) and acted as a catalyst for feminist art and art education. Her inclusion in hundreds of publications in various areas of the world showcases her influence in the worldwide art community. Additionally, many of her books have been published in other countries, making her work more accessible to international readers. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is \"The Dinner Party\", which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. \"The Dinner Party\" celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork. Other notable art projects by Chicago include International Honor Quilt, The Birth Project, Powerplay, and The Holocaust Project. She is represented by Jessica Silverman gallery and Salon 94 gallery. Chicago was included in Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People of 2018\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judy_Chicago> .

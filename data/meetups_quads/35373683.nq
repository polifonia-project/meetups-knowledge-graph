<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Oladipo> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Kehinde Babatunde Victor Oladipo (born May 4, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers, where in the 2012-2013 season he was named the Sporting News Men's College Basketball Player of the Year, the Co-NABC Defensive Player of the Year, and a first-team All-American by the USBWA and Sporting News. That year he was also named the winner of the Adolph Rupp Trophy, given annually to the top player in men's NCAA Division I basketball. Oladipo was drafted with the second overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic and went on to be named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. He was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2016 and then traded to the Indiana Pacers in 2017. He became a first-time NBA All-Star, led the league in steals, was named to the All-Defensive First Team and the All-NBA Third Team, and won the NBA Most Improved Player Award in his first season with Indiana. Despite an injury-riddled 2018â€“19 season, including a season-ending injury in January 2019, Oladipo was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve for the second straight year. In January 2021, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, but was dealt to the Heat just two months later. He underwent season-ending surgery after just four games with Miami and made his playing return in March 2022. Oladipo is also a singer, having released an EP, Songs for You in 2017 and his debut album V.O. in 2018. He also appeared as \"Thingamajig\" on season 2 of The Masked Singer, finishing in 5th." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Oladipo> .

Gregson composed the score for the 2015 film A Little Chaos, marking his first major film scoring job. Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair named it his favourite score of the year, dubbing it \"a string-heavy stunner\", though Dennis Harvey writing for Variety magazine described it as \"clich√©d, saccharine score\". Gregson was interviewed as part of BBC Radio Ulster's Classical Connections with John Toal programme in May 2015." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Gregson_(cellist)> .

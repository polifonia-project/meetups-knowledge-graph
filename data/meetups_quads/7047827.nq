<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeremy_Marre> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jeremy Marre (7 October 1943 – 15 March 2020) was an English television director, writer and producer who founded Harcourt Films and made films around the world. Much of his work focused on musical subjects. His reputation was made with the Beats of the Heart series, which introduced elements of what is now called world music, and its performers, to the Western world. Rhythms of Resistance, a film in the series, was where Paul Simon first saw Ladysmith Black Mambazo, who played a prominent role on Simon’s Graceland album. The New York Times said of Beats of the Heart: \"It can make your jaw drop regularly with astonishment.\" He has run director courses for the National Film and Television School, sat on the advisory boards for the British Library Sound Archive and the Arts Council of England, has broadcast widely on BBC radio, has written for The Times, New York Post and The Independent. There have been retrospectives of his music films at the Florence Film Festival and on Channel 4. In 2016, Marre was the first recipient of a new lifetime achievement award bestowed jointly by Arizona State University and Arizona Humanities." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jeremy_Marre> .

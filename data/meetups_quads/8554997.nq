<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diarmuid_O'Neill> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Diarmuid O'Neill (also known as Dermot O'Neill) (born 24 June 1969 in Hammersmith, London, England â€“ 23 September 1996), was a volunteer in the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). O'Neill was killed in London in 1996 during a police raid on the hotel where he and two other IRA volunteers were staying. Due to the circumstances surrounding the killing, Amnesty International has called for a review of the police investigation into the killing of O'Neill. O'Neill was the only IRA member to be killed by police in Great Britain." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diarmuid_O'Neill> .

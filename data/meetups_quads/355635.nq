He led the Japanese Socialist Party, and was responsible for changing its name to the Social Democratic Party of Japan in 1996. Upon becoming Prime Minister, he was Japan's first socialist leader in nearly fifty years. He is most remembered today for his speech \"On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the War's end\", in which he publicly apologised for Imperial Japanese atrocities committed during World War II. Of the ten living former prime ministers of Japan, he is currently the oldest living prime minister, following the death of Yasuhiro Nakasone on 29 November 2019. Murayama is also the only living former Japanese prime minister who was born in the Taishō era." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tomiichi_Murayama> .

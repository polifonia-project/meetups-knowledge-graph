<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorian_Concept> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Dorian Concept (born Oliver Thomas Johnson, 1984) is an Austrian composer, music producer and keyboardist whose work draws on an eclectic variety of sources including modal and free jazz, funk, hip-hop, electronic, ambient, and soundscape music. Johnson adopted his stage name as a teenager as a reference to the Dorian scale. Dorian Concept is also a member of the Austrian funk band Jacob's Salty and Bamboozling Ladder (JSBL). He also has periodically toured as a keyboardist for Flying Lotus (along with Richard Spaven on drums) and collaborated with the Cinematic Orchestra." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorian_Concept> .

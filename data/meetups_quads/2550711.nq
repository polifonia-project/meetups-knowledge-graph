She launched her singing career by winning first place in the Chinese singing contest Super Girl, in 2005. The following year, she released her debut album The Queen and the Dreams. Referred to as the mother of the unisex look in China, she has achieved mainstream success. She is also known for her lower mezzo-soprano vocal range, a rarity amongst Mainland Chinese female singers." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Li_Yuchun> .

Thomas Lee (c. 1690–November 14, 1750) was a planter and politician in colonial Virginia. He was a member of the Lee family, a political dynasty which included many figures from the colonial era until the late twentieth century. Lee became involved in politics in 1710 and became the resident manager of the Northern Neck Proprietary for Lady Catherine Fairfax. After his father died, Lee inherited land in Northumberland and Charles County. Lee later acquired vast holdings in what are now Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Prince William, and Loudoun Counties. These properties were developed as tobacco plantations. When Lee married Hannah Harrison Ludwell in 1722, he benefited by the connections of the already established Harrison family of Virginia. A year later he would become a member of the House of Burgesses. After Lee's home was burnt down by criminals, he lost almost all of his possessions and a fair sum of money. With donations received from Caroline of Ansbach and British officials, he built his new home on the Potomac River, naming it Stratford Hall. Four years later in 1733, he was appointed to the Governor's Council,the upper house of the General Assembly. In 1747, he founded the Ohio Company of Virginia with fellow Virginian colonists who wished to expand Virginia's territory into the Ohio River Valley. For a period of less than a year, in 1749, he became the de facto royal governor of Virginia in place of the absent William Gooch. Lee was favored for an appointment as governor by George II but died in 1750." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Lee_(Virginia_colonist)> .

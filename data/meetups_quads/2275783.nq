<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_de_la_Pole> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Richard de la Pole (died 24 February 1525) was a pretender to the English crown. Commonly nicknamed \"White Rose\", he was the last Yorkist claimant to actively and openly seek the crown of England. He lived in exile after many of his relatives were executed, becoming allied with Louis XII of France in the War of the League of Cambrai. Louis saw him as a more favourable ally and prospect for an English king than Henry VIII. During 1514, the stage was set for a Yorkist reclaiming of England under Richard. He was in Brittany with 12,000 mercenaries set for the invasion, leading his army to St. Malo; however, France and England made peace just as they were about to embark and it was thus called off. Later, with Francis I as king, Richard struck up an alliance in 1523 and planned a Yorkist invasion of England once again. However, this never came to fruition, as Richard died fighting alongside Francis I at the Battle of Pavia two years later." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_de_la_Pole> .

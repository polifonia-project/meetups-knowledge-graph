Following drama training at the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, Hart began writing material for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and making appearances in various British sitcoms, including Hyperdrive (2006–2007) and Not Going Out (2006–2009). Hart reached a wider audience with her self-driven semi-autobiographical BBC sitcom Miranda, which is based on her earlier BBC Radio 2 radio series Miranda Hart's Joke Shop (2008). The television sitcom ran for three series and several Christmas specials from 2009 to 2015, and earned her three Royal Television Society awards, four British Comedy Awards and four BAFTA nominations. From 2012 to 2015, she appeared as Camilla \"Chummy\" Fortescue-Cholmondeley-Browne in the BBC drama series Call the Midwife. She made her Hollywood debut in the action comedy film Spy (2015). Hart has also written four books: Is It Just Me? (2012), a semi-autobiographical book; The Best of Miranda (2014), a compilation of scripts from the TV series; Peggy and Me (2016), a description of her life since owning her titular dog; and Miranda Hart's Daily Dose of Such Fun! (2017), in partnership with Comic Relief. In 2017, Hart presented the Royal Variety Performance in the presence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, making her the first solo female presenter in 105 years; she and the Duke are distant cousins." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miranda_Hart> .

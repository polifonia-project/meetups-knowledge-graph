<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rogvolod> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rogvolod (Russian: Рогволод, romanized: Rogvolod; Belarusian: Рагвалод, romanized: Rahvałod; c. 920 – 978) was the first chronicled prince of Polotsk (945–978). In the Russian Primary Chronicle, he is known as Рогъволодъ, probably a slavicized version of the Old Norse name Ragnvald. The name has also been connected with the Russian words рог and володеть, from which the formation of the name may have come. He was a Varangian, unrelated to Vladimir the Great, and was established at Polotsk in the mid-10th century, most likely having come from overseas (i.e., from Scandinavia or the Southern Baltic). According to the Russian Primary Chronicle, Vladimir the Great sought an alliance with him in 980 by marrying his daughter Rogneda, but she refused, insulting his parentage, and married his brother, Yaropolk. In revenge, Vladimir attacked Rogvolod and his family, killing him and his sons, after which he raped Rogneda, and forcibly took her as his bride." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rogvolod> .

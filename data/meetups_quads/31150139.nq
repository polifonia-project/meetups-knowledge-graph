He composed \"Good Morning Beautiful\", a 2002 five-week country number one (Billboard) hit for Steve Holy (co-written with Zack Lyle); \"The Blues Is My Business\" (co-written with Kevin Bowe), part of Etta James' 2003 Grammy Award-winning album \"Let's Roll\"; and \"I'll Still Be Loving You\", a 1987 country number one (Billboard) hit for Restless Heart (co-written with Pam Rose, Mary Ann Kennedy, and Pat Bunch). He and his co-writers were nominated for a Grammy Award for \"I'll Still Be Loving You\". The song won the 1988 award for \"ASCAP Country Song of the Year\". Cerney was born in Detroit, Michigan, and graduated from Zanesville High School in Zanesville, Ohio in 1971. He began his song-writing career after moving to Nashville, where he initially worked at Buzz Cason's Creative Workshop as an audio engineer. Some of the earliest artists to record his songs include Steve Carlisle (\"I'll Fall in Love Again\") and Levon Helm (\"Blue House of Broken Hearts\")." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Todd_Cerney> .

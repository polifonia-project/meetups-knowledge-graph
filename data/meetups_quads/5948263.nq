<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rami_Fortis> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Rami Fortis (Hebrew: רמי פורטיס, [ˈʁami ˈfoʁtis], born July 7, 1954), or simply Fortis, is an Israeli rock singer. Born in Tel Aviv, Fortis became known as a pioneer of Israeli punk rock. His debut album Plonter, released in 1978, was not a commercial success at the time, though today it is considered an influential cult album. His fame in Israel came with the release of a Hebrew language album, Sipurim Me'hakufsa (Tales from the Box), in 1988. Due to his behaviour on stage he was nicknamed The Madman (HaMeshuga). Apart from his work in music, Rami Fortis served as a judge for the first season of The X Factor Israel." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rami_Fortis> .

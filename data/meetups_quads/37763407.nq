<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amari_Cooper> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Amari Cooper (born June 17, 1994) is an American football wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Alabama, where he was the Biletnikoff Award winner as the nation's top receiver and a unanimous All-American in 2014. Widely considered the top wide receiver prospect of the 2015 NFL Draft, Cooper was selected with the fourth overall pick by the Oakland Raiders. After successful rookie and sophomore seasons that included back-to-back 1,000-yard campaigns and two Pro Bowl appearances, Cooper struggled in his third season with the Raiders, totaling just 680 yards. Midway through the 2018 season, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys and his play began to flourish again, including a 217-yard performance, and as a result, was voted to the third Pro Bowl of his career. Cooper also had successive 1,000 yard seasons in 2019 and 2020, making the Pro Bowl in 2019." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amari_Cooper> .

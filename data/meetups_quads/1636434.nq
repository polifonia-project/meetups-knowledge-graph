<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Davis_(music_journalist)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Stephen Davis is an American music journalist and historian. Davis was born in New York City and attended Boston University. He began his career writing for the Boston Phoenix in 1970. His journalism has appeared in Rolling Stone, The New York Times, the Boston Globe and numerous other papers and magazines. Davis says his love of music started when he was invited by a priest to join the church's choir. Davis has been described as \"perhaps America's best-known rock biographer\", having written biographies of Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Michael Jackson, Carly Simon, Bob Marley, Levon Helm, Jim Morrison, and Stevie Nicks, among others. However, his biographies often contain incorrect facts and fabricated versions of the truth. Some of his subjects, including Led Zeppelin, have come out about the books inaccuracies. Some have refused to communicate Davis altogether. Davis lives in Milton, Massachusetts." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stephen_Davis_(music_journalist)> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_Augustus_I_of_Saxony> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frederick Augustus I (German: Friedrich August I.; Polish: Fryderyk August I; 23 December 1750 â€“ 5 May 1827) was a member of the House of Wettin who reigned as the last Elector of Saxony from 1763 to 1806 (as Frederick Augustus III) and as King of Saxony from 1806 to 1827. He was also Duke of Warsaw from 1807 to 1815. Throughout his political career Frederick Augustus tried to rehabilitate and recreate the Polish state that was torn apart and ceased to exist after the final partition of Poland in 1795. However he did not succeed, for which he blamed himself for the rest of his life. Nevertheless, his efforts at reestablishing an independent Polish nation did endear him to the Polish people. The Augustusplatz in Leipzig is named after him." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_Augustus_I_of_Saxony> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_P._Jackson> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jonathan Peter Jackson (June 23, 1953 â€“ August 7, 1970) was an American youth, who died of gunshot wounds suffered during his armed invasion of a California courthouse. At age 17, Jackson stormed the Marin County Courthouse with automatic weapons, kidnapping Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, prosecutor Gary Thomas, and three jurors. Escaping with the hostages, Jackson demanded the Soledad Brothers' immediate release from prison. The Soledad Brothers, a group of African American inmates facing charges for allegedly throwing a white prison guard to his death at San Quentin, included Jackson's elder brother George Jackson. None of the Soledad defendants were at the courthouse on the day of the attack. In an ensuing shootout, Jackson and Judge Haley were killed, along with two inmates already in the courtroom, who had readily joined the attack; prosecutor Thomas was paralyzed and one juror was seriously injured. The guns that Jackson used were registered to political activist Angela Davis, who previously formed a committee supporting the Soledad Brothers. Davis stood trial for alleged involvement in the kidnapping and was acquitted of all charges in June 1972." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jonathan_P._Jackson> .

She rose to prominence after a series of collaborations with musician Lady Gaga. She is also a founding member of the !WOWOW! Collective of London, England. She began her career at age 17 on a Berlin stage where she vomited onto a canvas after drinking glasses of dyed milk, a performance that lasted for two hours. In an interview with The Guardian, she states, “I wanted to use my body to create art. I wanted to come from within, to create something beautiful that was raw and uncontrollable.” She now works and resides in Los Angeles, California." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millie_Brown_(performance_artist)> .

His first recognition came for his patriotic lyrics for the film Bandhan (1940). His status as a nationalistic writer got immortalised for writing a daringly patriotic song \"Door Hato Ae Duniya Walo\" (Move Away O Outsiders) in India's first golden jubilee hit Kismet (1943) because he was forced to go underground to avoid arrest immediately after the film's release that invited the ire of British government. In a career span of five decades, Kavi Pradeep wrote about 1,700 songs and nationalistic poems including the lyrics for some 72 films, including hits like \"Chal Chal Re Naujawan\" in film Bandhan (1940) and \"Aao Bachcho Tumhein Dikhayen\" and \"De Dee Hame Azaadi\" in the film Jagriti (1954) In 1958, HMV, released an album of 13 songs with his lyrics. He was made the Rashtrakavi (National Poet), and came to be known as, Kavi Pradeep. In 1997, he was honoured with India's highest award in cinema, the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, for lifetime achievement." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kavi_Pradeep> .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Brown_(pilot)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Captain Eric Melrose \"Winkle\" Brown, CBE, DSC, AFC, Hon FRAeS, RN (21 January 1919 â€“ 21 February 2016) was a British Royal Navy officer and test pilot who flew 487 types of aircraft, more than anyone else in history. Brown holds the world record for the most aircraft carrier deck take-offs and landings performed (2,407 and 2,271 respectively) and achieved several \"firsts\" in naval aviation, including the first landings on an aircraft carrier of a twin-engined aircraft, an aircraft with a tricycle undercarriage, a jet aircraft, and a rotary-wing aircraft. He flew almost every category of Royal Navy and Royal Air Force aircraft: glider, fighter, bomber, airliner, amphibian, flying boat and helicopter. During World War II, he flew many types of captured German, Italian, and Japanese aircraft, including new jet and rocket aircraft. He was a pioneer of jet technology into the postwar era." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eric_Brown_(pilot)> .

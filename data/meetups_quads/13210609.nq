Shana released an album in 1989 entitled I Want You on Vision Records, which peaked at No. 165 on the Billboard Top 200. The album yielded two U.S. hit singles in 1990, \"I Want You\" (Billboard Hot 100 peak No. 40) and \"You Can't Get Away\" (Hot 100 peak No. 82). After her successes with dance music, Shana disappeared from the mainstream music scene. She reappeared as a country music singer under her full given name, and released three singles with Epic Nashville, \"Heaven Bound\" in 1998 and \"This Time\" in 1999. \"Heaven Bound\" was a hit on CMT and reached No. 60 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Her third single on country radio was \"Something Real\", also supported by a music video. Despite three singles, Shana's country music album on Epic Nashville was never released. She is still recording country music but is no longer signed to a major record label." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shana_(singer)> .

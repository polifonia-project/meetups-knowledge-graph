<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Curzon> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Frank Curzon (17 September 1868 â€“ 2 July 1927) was an English actor who became an important theatre manager, leasing the Royal Strand Theatre, Avenue Theatre, Criterion Theatre, Comedy Theatre, Prince of Wales Theatre and Wyndham's Theatre, among others. Curzon produced some of the most successful Edwardian musical comedies, including A Chinese Honeymoon (1903) and Miss Hook of Holland (1907; one of several successes starring his wife, Isabel Jay), and he later produced several plays starring Ivor Novello. Curzon was involved in a number of legal disputes, the most celebrated of which involved an audience member who refused to remove her hat. When Curzon prevented her from returning to her seat, she charged him with assault. Curzon won. Later in life, Curzon became a very successful racehorse breeder, and in 1927 his horse Call Boy won The Derby." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frank_Curzon> .

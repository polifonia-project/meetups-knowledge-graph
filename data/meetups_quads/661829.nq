<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Tye> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Christopher Tye (c.1505 â€“ before 1573) was an English Renaissance composer and organist. Probably born in Cambridgeshire, he trained at the University of Cambridge and became the master of the choir at Ely Cathedral. He is noted as the music teacher of Edward VI of England and was held in high esteem for his choral music, as well as chamber works such as his 24 polyphonic In nomines. It is likely that only a small percentage of his compositional output survives, often only as fragments; his Acts of the Apostles was the only work to be published in his lifetime. He ceased composing when he became a clergyman, returning to Ely Cathedral and later becoming rector of Doddington, Cambridgeshire. Today, he is perhaps best known for the hymn \"Winchester Old\", based on a theme from Acts of the Apostles, which forms the basis of the most commonly performed version in the United Kingdom of \"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\"." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Tye> .

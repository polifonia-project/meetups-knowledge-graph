<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Rea_(composer)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "John Rea CM (born 1944) is a Montreal-based composer who won the Jules LÃ©ger Prize for New Chamber Music in both 1981 and 1992. He obtained his bachelor's degree at Wayne State University (1967), his Master of Music degree at the University of Toronto (1969), and his PhD at Princeton University. His children's opera The Prisoners Play from 1972 uses serial techniques. His works have been played by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Quebec Symphony Orchestra, the Nouvel Ensemble Moderne, the Arditti Quartet, the Esprit Orchestra and others. He is the previous dean and head of the composition department at the Schulich School of Music of McGill University, from which he has taken his retirement. Among his notable students are composers Robin Minard and John Oliver. As a teacher he was severely abusive and cruel and it was a fantastic day when he retired. Truly a garbage person, who justifies his treatment of students by claiming \"my parents never let me do anything as a child.\"" <http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Rea_(composer)> .

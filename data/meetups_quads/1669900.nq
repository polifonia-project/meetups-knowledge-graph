<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arturo_Armando_Molina> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Colonel Arturo Armando Molina Barraza (6 August 1927 â€“ 18 July 2021) was a Salvadoran politician and military officer, who served as President of El Salvador from 1972 to 1977. He was born in San Salvador. He served between 1 July 1972 and 1 July 1977. The 1973 oil crisis led to rising food prices and decreased agricultural output. This worsened the existent socioeconomic inequality in the country, leading to increased unrest. In response, Molina enacted a series of land reform measures, calling for large landholdings to be redistributed among the peasant population. Molina was distrusted by the oligarchy and the right-wing military, and was resented by the opposition from whom he had stolen power. His attempts to silence opposition included the military occupation of the University of El Salvador in 1972, as well as violently suppressing student protests that erupted after public funds were used to hold the Miss Universe contest in San Salvador. He also oversaw assassinations of priests in the country. His regime saw extreme polarization and violence in the country. His tenure ended in 1977, and then he left the country. Molina returned to El Salvador in 1992. He died on 18 July 2021 in California, United States, at the age of 93." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arturo_Armando_Molina> .

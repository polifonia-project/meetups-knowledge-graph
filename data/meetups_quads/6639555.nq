<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Andrews> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "James Pratt Andrews (June 5, 1865 – December 27, 1907) was an American professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1890 for the Chicago Colts of the National League. He was a native of Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. In 1890, his only Major League season, Andrews was in the starting lineup for the first 2½ months (April 19 – July 4) of the 5½ month season. In 53 games he was just 38-for-202, a batting average of .188. He had 3 home runs, 17 RBI, and scored 32 runs. An average fielder for the era, he handled 90 out of 100 chances successfully for a fielding percentage of .900. To give some perspective to his value to the team, the Colts were 29-28 during his time with them, and 54-25 after he was gone. Andrews died at the age of 42 in Chicago of pulmonary tuberculosis, and was laid to rest at Mount Olivet Cemetery." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jim_Andrews> .

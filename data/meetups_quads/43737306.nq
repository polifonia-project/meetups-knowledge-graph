Its series include Create Together (Emmy winner), Escape the Night, HitRECord on TV (Emmy winner), Finding Prince Charming, Lance Loves Michael: The Lance Bass Wedding Special, Walk of Shame, Gay Skit Happens, and The Disappearance of Natalee Holloway. Graden was previously a senior vice president at Foxlab, Fox’s alternative programming unit. While there he oversaw shows like COPs and America’s Most Wanted. He also created the relationship show, STUDS. In 1997, he became MTV’s executive VP of programming, and was put in charge of all programming. This was a change for MTV, as the network previously had four programming executives. In 2002, he was promoted to president of programming for MTV and MTV2. Later that year, after being asked to assess a struggling VH1, he was named President Entertainment, MTV and VH1. He was responsible for the programming strategy and development slate for VH1, and the creative and business developments of MTV, MTV2, CMT, and, eventually, Logo, which was launched in 2005 as the first 24 hour gay and lesbian network with Graden as president. As President of Entertainment, Graden oversaw and/or greenlit shows like Total Request Live, The Osbournes, Jackass, Jersey Shore, and Teen Moms for MTV; Best Week Ever and I Love the 80s for VH1; and RuPaul’s Drag Race for Logo. Prior to his work with MTV, Graden worked with Trey Parker and Matt Stone as an executive producer of the hit animated series South Park." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brian_Graden> .

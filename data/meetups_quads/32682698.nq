<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luciano_Chailly> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Luciano Chailly (Ferrara, 19 January 1920 â€“ Milan, 24 December 2002) was an Italian composer and arts administrator of French descent. He was an eclectic and prolific composer in the post-war Italy, combining tonal, polytonal, and twelve-tone techniques. Grew up under fascism, Chailly remained apolitical and was a humanist. As he witnessed the brutality of war by serving in second World War, several compositions reflect his repudiation of war. Chailly was best known for his operas, many of which were composed to libretti by Dino Buzzati. He was the father of conductor Riccardo Chailly, harpist and composer Cecilia Chailly, and journalist and film director Floriana Chailly." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luciano_Chailly> .

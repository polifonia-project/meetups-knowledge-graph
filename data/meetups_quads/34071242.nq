<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jennifer_O'Connor_(musician)> <http://w3id.org/polifonia/ontology/meetups-ontology#hasAbstract> "Jennifer O'Connor (born November 8, 1973) is an American singer-songwriter. She has released a series of well-regarded solo albums, and has either toured or played with Wilco, the Indigo Girls, Feist, Yo La Tengo, Dump, and the Mountain Goats, among other bands and musicians. Paste magazine has called her a \"songwriter's songwriter\", describing her albums as \"master classes in economy and clarity.\" While she is one of a limited number of notable independent musicians who is publicly out as gay, she does not write music obviously targeted to a gay audience. She is based in Brooklyn and in addition to writing and performing her own music, she also runs a record label, Kiam Records, with seven other artists on its roster." <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jennifer_O'Connor_(musician)> .

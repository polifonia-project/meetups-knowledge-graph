Evans studied the history of prison architecture for his doctorate. His essays and reviews were published in journals including Lotus, Casa Bella, Architectural Review and AA Files. He lectured at the Polytechnic of Central London, the Cambridge school of architecture, England, the AA, and the Bartlett School, University College London.

# MEETUPS Knowledge Graph 

## Musical Meetups Knowledge Graph (MMKG)

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/588597123.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/588597123)

The MEETUPS knowledge graph contains data about historical encounters of people in the musical world in Europe from c. 1800 to c. 1945.


## Knowledge Graph description

The KG was built using data collected from Wikipedia. A total of 33309 biographies of musical artist's web pages were collected [1].
The MMKG data contains evidence that describes historical meetups according to Meetups Ontology [2]. 
We apply knowledge extraction techniques and methods for text processing to recognise, classify and link the entities that are part of a historical meetup, particularly: people, places, time expressions and themes.

The MMKG is one of the main components of the MEETUPS Pilot.

## Competency questions related to MMKG

The KG answers the CQs formalised as part of the Meetups Ontology knowledge requirements.

Ortenz
- What places did musician Z visited in her career?
- Where did she perform?
- Where did she live?
- Did musician X and performer Y ever meet? Where, when, and why?
- In what context the meeting happened?
- What is the nature of the event?
- Was it a celebration, a festival, a private event?
- Was it a religious or a secular event?
- Who paid to support the event?
- What is the provenance of the event attendees? What and how they happened to be there?
- Did they travel to reach the place?
- Were they invited? Was the meeting accidental?
- How can we characterize the relation among the participants?
- Was there a power relation? (e.g., Patreon / Musician)

## Statistics:

We use SPARQL Anything and design CONSTRUCT mappings, to create triples from each biography. To obtain these statistics we build a series of queries available here
```
queries/statistics_query.sparql
```
```
-------------------------------
| key                 | value |
===============================
| "Biographies"       | 33309 |
| "Meetups"           | 45812 |
| "Persons mentioned" | 49170 |
| "Subjects"          | 16748 |
| "Places mentions"   | 7107  |
| "Time expressions"  | 51120 |
-------------------------------
```

It is possible to use SPARQL Anything to generate the same statistics using the CSV-generated
```
$ fx -q queries/statistics.sparql -l data/meetups/
```

## KG construction

### Pre-requirements

The KG is built using the output of the knowledge construction pipeline. 
To run the following commands, first:
- Download the SPARQL Anything command line from the [project release page]https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything/releases.
SPARQL Anything requires Java >= 11. We used the  sparql-anything-0.8.1 version
- Download the CSV files generated as output of the [Knowledge extraction pipeline]https://github.com/polifonia-project/meetups_pilot
	- Folders: 
- Download the CONSTRUCT mapping scripts from 
	- script 1
	- script 2
	
### Commands

Generate a list of biographies and related files.
```
fx -q queries/list-sample.sparql -o data/biographies.csv -f CSV
```
Generate sentences KG data
```
fx -q queries/sentences.sparql -i data/biographies.csv -p "data/sentences/?fileId.ttl" -f TTL
```

[part above to be updated...]

```
fx -q queries/sentences.sparql -v fileId=10085 -v subject=http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Elgar
```

Last step: generate `meetups_quads` from `meetups_triples` and `list-of-biographies.csv`:
```
fx -q queries/generate_nq_each.sparql -v data/list-of-biographies.csv -f NQ -p "./data/meetups_quads/?id.nq"
```
